' <div class=\"postbody\">It\' is going very bad with the K teacher since day 1, my child comes crying everyday because of the difference in the treatment. He is aware that teacher prefers certain kids to others. We are immigrants and the teacher is a little bit not very tolerant, she prefers blond blue eyes kids. He thinks its the norm because of the previous pre-k bad experience. I know that teachers will not go against each other for a child. Please note that the child is extremely bright academically and way above K level. I don\'t want my child to have a low self esteem and feel inferior. Last week a parent pulled their daughter from the class but went to another school (also immigrants).  What solutions do I have? He doesn\'t want to be homeschooled. He loves people.  Thank you for your help</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">We are dog nuts in this house. I approach every dog I meet with open arms. My \"dream job\" would be to own a doggie daycare...Both my kids love dogs and all animals for that matter. I know many adults and NT kids who fear dogs...Watch animal planet together, petco and maybe check out the puupy store at the mall..    Tracy</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Assuming 47 and dktekno are sincere and are coming back to discuss this issue, I have questions.  What do you each consider \"changing?\"  How would you advise the parent to care for his autistic child?  Which therapies, health care and educational methods <em>do </em>you endorse for a child with autism?    I understand that you both are saying that you appreciate the way your mind works.  What advice do you have for parents, then, who are guiding children with autistic minds into adulthood and into the world?</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Fred, 7, NT  Barney, 5, autism</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Fred, 7, NT  Barney, 5, autism</div>'
