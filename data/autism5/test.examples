'<P>Thanks so much everyone.</P> <P>Maybe I\'ll try cutting his nails when he\'s asleep next. When he\'s really asleep, I swear I can move him around all sorts of ways and he wouldn\'t wake up! </P> <P>I did cut his hair a bit, just the front that was in his face. His father held him while I cut it a bit. Not as bad as nails, but not good either. Not cut too even...but, what can you do?</P> <P>Thanks again,</P> <P>Patty</P> <P> </P>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I don\'t remember, in all these years, you ever mentioning your son.  I don\'t visit too often anymore so I may have missed recent posts.  I just remember you being a source of valuable information (maybe I just forgot <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" /> ).  I hope Fred is happy with his new bike.  By the way, I also never knew what BTDT stands for....is it a secret ?</div>'
