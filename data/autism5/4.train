' <div class=\"postbody\">I make butternut squash fries - peel the squash, slice it up like fries, mix w/ a little olive oil just to coat.  I find they come out best on 375 for about 30-35 mins on a baking stone lined w/ parchment paper.  Sometimes I turn off the oven and leave them in for another few minutes to dry out and become crisper.  You can puree a squash for mashed potatoes (maybe mix in some ckn broth) or you can cook cauliflower and then put it in a food processor w/ some salt, maybe some garlic.  Comes out pretty similar to mashers.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to Rosie, 7yrs - ASD Long Island, NY</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to Rosie, 7yrs - ASD Long Island, NY</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Keep us posted on what you experience. I would love to take them too, but they are a bit pricey, I might order Curcumin from somewhere else for myself.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Lynn Mom to Dylan (Just turned 5) Somewhere on the spectrum</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Lynn Mom to Dylan (Just turned 5) Somewhere on the spectrum</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello, I started my son on this 2 weeks ago it was the one for $48.  In 2 weeks my sons language has improved, socialization has improved and stools improved within 3 days to being fully solid and he is going 2 times a day and wanting to eat often which before he had very little appetite.  The improvements started immediately and have slowly built as the days have gone by.  All his therapists have been so excited about the improvements they are seeing in him.  His preschool teachers have come to me the last few times excited about his improvements also.  Everyone is noticing them in such a short period of time.  Now for the negatives.  My son reacts to everything and this is no exception I was giving 1/2 capsule 2 times a day and he was not sleeping well at night, sometimes getting up 7 or 8 times and constantly wanting to drink and having a bellyache.  I have decreased it to 1/2 capsule in the morning and now he is sleeping most of the night.  Even at this small dose there have been improvements.  When I increase to 3/4 capsule he gets a terrible belly ache and I have to back off.  This product is well worth the money I think.  I have seen just as much improvement with this as I did with the cytoflora, my son just couldn\'t handle the cytoflora.</div>'
