'<P><strong><FONT color=#990066 size=4>boobear-</FONT></strong></P> <P><strong><FONT color=#990066 size=4>Benadryl is an antihistamine used for allergies or to help sleep. I used it to help me sleep. I became quite \"addicted\" to it and had a hard time getting off. It\'s not an \"addictive\" drug, but I guess it was for me. Here are it\'s uses:</FONT></strong></P> <P><strong>PRESCRIBED FOR:</strong> Diphenhydramine is used for the relief of nasal and non-nasal symptoms of various allergic conditions such as seasonal allergic rhinitis. It is also used to treat patients with chronic urticaria. Although antihistamines are the preferred class of drugs in allergic rhinitis, they only reduce symptoms by 40-60%. Diphenhydramine also is used for allergic reactions involving the eyes (allergic conjunctivitis), to prevent or treat active <A href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/&#115;cript/main/art.asp?articlekey=9485\" target=\"_blank\"><FONT color=#0033cc>motion sickness</FONT></A>, and for mild cases of Parkinsonism, including drug-induced Parkinsonism. The last two uses (motion sickness and Parkinsonism) are based on the anticholinergic effects of diphenhydramine, and not its antihistamine effects. Diphenhydramine also is used as an aid for insomnia.</P> <P><strong><FONT color=#990099 size=4>I found this too!! I feel better!</FONT></strong></P> <P><B>PREGNANCY:</B> Diphenhydramine has been used extensively in pregnant women; the incidence of fetal malformations is the same as that which would be expected in women who are not taking medications. Additionally, studies in animals suggest no important effects on the fetus. Diphenhydramine, therefore, can be used in pregnancy if the physician feels that it is needed. </P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Holly_WA on July 04 2007 at 7:07pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- http://themeluginmonkeys.blogspot.com    Holly-mom to:    DH-David-Aspergers  Sarah-14y Anxiety  Rachel-13y Severe anxiety, Bipolar, ADD, LD\'s, CAPD  Jacob-9y HFA, anxiety, ADHD  Anna-7y anxiety???</div>'

'*giggle* on the \"bendy little arms\" too!<br> <br> Luke, as well, would suck on everyone\'s toothbrushes if I allowed him. I once put a very small dab (like, miniscule) of adult toothpaste on Luke\'s brush and boy did he sputter and spit! He loves to suck the toddler toothpaste off his own brush. I think that\'s why he likes getting his teeth brushed!<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Kellie  Mommy to Luke (autism, 7 yrs) & Andrew (5 yr) & Alyssa (3 yrs)</div>'
