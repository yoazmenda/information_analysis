'jonsdfca -What size class did your son have in preschool? If his preschool IEP requires a smaller class size, they have to explain (in writing if you request) why they have upped his class size. In term of benefit to him, not in terms of whether or not they have an appropriate class in the school. They must FIND an appropriate class if putting him in the kindergarten with the all the kids is not \"reasonably calculated\" to enable him to make \"more than trivial progress.\" This is what the law says. If you believe he will not progress at all in his proposed placement, you can go to Due Process and make a case that the District is setting him up to fail. Read your Due Process Rights - the school MUST give every parent at copy at least once a year.'

Everybody thinks i have a hearing problem, hahaha.</td> </tr> </table></td> </tr> </table></td> </tr> </table> <br /> <br />Actually I can relate to that very well. I am on the move a lot. I haven\'t really settled down much mostly because I need the fresh start over and over. I currently have 3 nearly separate lives in 3 separate towns (although thankfully, one of them wil be coming to a close at the end of this month). One of the bands I played with (of which my brother was also a member as a drummer) did do fairly well locally, playing gigs on and off for about 2 years. We broke up when our frontman decided to go solo, essentially ditching us in the process. <br /> <br />I do get taken advantage of and misunderstood a lot on the job, and that\'s one reason why I have never kept any one job more than about 2 years. This school-teaching experience that I\'m dealing with right now has been absolutely horrendous for me from all aspects, and I have been in almost continuous overload for the past 3 months. My separate lives in my hometown (where my family lives), and my college town (where I have some close friends), serve as escapes for me on weekends and scheduled breaks. I will leave teaching behind in less than a week, and focus solely on my other 2 \"lives.\" I will seek to find employment and stability in one place, while using the other as an escape and a crutch. I\'m not yet sure which town will fill which role, though. After I\'ve had a few weeks to recover emotionally, I will proceed to figure that one out.<span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by stickboy26 on May 25 2007 at 9:21am</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>-   ~Nick   Still in touch with my inner child ;)</div>'
