' <div class=\"postbody\">Something I\'ve been thinking about lately is siblings. If you have children who don\'t have autism, how do you handle their jealousy when you give more time to your autistic child? How do you handle when you can\'t go somewhere (like the mall or amusement parks) because it\'s too difficult for your autistic child? How do you raise your NT children so that they will <em>want</em> to take care or help their autistic brother or sister when we parents are too old?</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">BTDT, it\'s interesting, and maybe you had the same scenario, but when you\'re there with the geneticist and he says \"we\'re going to do an Enzyme Assay\" - it doesn\'t sound so awful - okay, and enzyme assay, sure. At the time I was preoccupied with other syndromes that the idea he might have a metabolic disorder (enzyme assay hint hint) went right past me. </div>    Yeah, I know what you mean. I really didn\'t think too much about it when they tested Fred, but the geneticist was doubtful that was the problem. She just wanted to test him because he has a \"coarse facies\", or at least that\'s what she told me. I think they just feel obligated to cover all the bases.    It does sound like you\'re in good hands, I don\'t think you could do much better than Duke.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I\'m very torn on this issue. One one hand, it definitely is way to soon to predict anything. On the other hand, if DH and I die tomorrow for some reason, we have to already have something in place to cover all possibilities (I guess our situation is different because we have no family in the States).   I have to say, it gave me great peace of mind to set up a sp. needs trust for Alex. You can make it \"real\" instead of \"virtual\" by putting actual $\'s in it (except they are not tax deferred) and if he is college material (doubtful at this juncture), he can help himself to them when the time comes. It took me forever to get DH to stop procrastinating and sign the papers, but now we both feel like a burden has been lifted.  Basically, I came to the conclusion that the \"prepare for the worst, hope for the best\" holds.

' <div class=\"postbody\">LMP,  The information I am about to give is taken from literature about Therapeutic Listening given to me from my therapist and I have only selected some key ponts that I thought were relevant to your questions.    \"Therapeutic Listening uses sound in combination with sensory integrative techniques, emphasizing vestibular activities directed towards the integrating functions of the vestibular structures that they support. Therapuetic Listening selectively combines a number of electronically altered compact discs within a Sensory Integration frame of reference. These discs vary in musical style, quality of sounds and level of enhancement. Individual listening programs are created to address each client\'s specific problem. The choice of music and type of modulation, as well as listening time varies depending on the treatment goals of the client.\"    <strong>How is the music altered?</strong>  * Modified CDs -  \"the music on these CDs is processed through an alternating high pass low pass filter. Sometimes the higher frequencies are allowed to pass; sometimes the lower frequencies are allowed to pass. This type of modification is referred to as modulation and is what creates the disrupted sound to the music.......    * SAMONAS-CQ CDs are naturally spectrally activiated. They are selections of classical music that are recorded to the specifications of Ingo Steinbach with respect to instrumentation and preservation of the space within which the recording occurs. HS CDs have dampened frequencies below 300 Hz. SE and ST SAMONAS recordings undergo a process that increases the level of spectral activation. When passages of the music are spectrally activated, it means that the harmonics in the higher frequencies have been intensified. It is in the higher harmonic ranges that the detailed information of the sound is carried. Spectral activation does not create a disrupted quality to the overall sound of the music. Additionally, some selections on ST SAMONAS CDs are known as high extension passages. These are brief passages of music where only the high harmonics remain; the overall volume of these passages of music will seem quite soft and the ears will have to reach for the sound.    <strong>Can listening be done over loudspeakers?</strong>  Once loudspeakers are used, the listening program being delivered is radically different. Sound travels as waves through space. The greater the space through which the sound waves must travel, the less the sound waves impact the listener. The modified CDs and most SAMONAS CDs are NOT configured for speaker use. They should only be used over headphones. Of the SAMONAS CDs, only the CQ level of recordings are configured for speaker use and can be played as backround music......    <strong>What changes should I look for?</strong>If your therapeutic Listening Program is \"just right\" then you will observe changes in the targeted areas of intervention. These changes might include:  (The items in bold are things we are targeting in Aidan\'s program)    <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Modulation</span>    * Improvement in sleep/wake cycles  * Reduction of sensory defensive behaviors  * A smoothing out\" of mood varience and arousal state  * Cessation of bedwetting  * Increased regularity of hunger and thirst cycles  * <strong>Improved focus and attention</strong>  * <strong>Improvement in transitions</strong>    <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Postural Tone/Postural Attention?Postural Adaptation</span>    * Establishment of body midline  * Ability to sustain active posture onstable and dynamic surfaces  * Improved cocontraction around shoulders and hips.  * Active use of rotation in movement patterns    <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Motor Control</span>    * <strong>Use of bilateral motor patterns</strong>  * \"Emergence\" of praxis  * <strong>Improved articulation</strong>  * Improved fine motor skill    <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Spatial Temporal Organiztion</span>    * <strong>Improved Timing of motor execution</strong>  * Improved timing of social interactions  * Discrimination of the dimensionality and directionality of spatial concepts  * Improved ability to maneuver through space  * Improved handwriting and visual motor skill    <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Communication</span>    * Greater range of nonverrbal communication  * Nonverbal communication matches communicative intent  * Greater emotional expressiveness  * <strong>Improvement in pragmatic language use</strong>      LMP, this packet has pages of information and I would be happy to make a copy and mail it to you if you are interested. My fingers are tired as I am not a good typist.  We did purchase headphones for $45 though my therapist said we could use any headphones that fit w/in some criteron she gave us that I don\'t have in front of me at the moment.  Another thing that she said was very important was to make sure the CDs are listened to on random so that your child is not listening to the music in the same order each time.   She makes all the decisions on which discs we should listen to and when to change discs. Also, in general a child should not be using the same music with no change for any loger than 2-3 weeks.  I would not implement a program like this without an OT that is well trained and familiar with the program to guide you through. We do not pay our OT extra for this she just provides us with the info and directions as part of the session. Aidan does his afternoon listening during OT (on the day he has OT) so she is also able to access which activities work well for Aidan while listening.    Hope this answers your questions some  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Kayley, 5(NT)  Aidan, 3 (PDD-NOS)</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Kayley, 5(NT)  Aidan, 3 (PDD-NOS)</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Alex\'s mom said \"And have you not figured out by now ? - the only kids who make steady progress with no bumps in the road or temporary setbacks for parents are always someone else\'s kids, never our own  ? \"    Gosh, i thought like this for the longest time until we saw progress with expressive speech, a while back. Now that we arent moving forward much lately, either, i am back to thinking this way. But things will improve and I wouldnt let one test worry you. My son just had some tests by the SLT done yesterday. The SLT KNEW he could do better, but he was just so tuned out so he failed some. He didnt want to be there, had his head in his hands and was \"stimming\" on some sensory toys.     I bet, joeysmom, if the test had taken place on a different day, different results would come out. Please don\'t get too deflated by the tests. I wrecked myself worrying about them. You know yourself what your child is capable of, and where he is at in \"real\" time, thats what counts.     To be honest if someone had been in my face, flashing cards in front of my eyes and calling my name every 10 seconds, like what happened with my son yesterday through his tests, i would tune out too and NOT cooperate.     Its like they know, \"oh here we go again\".</div>'

Normally they\'re pretty strict about that stuff, but they\'ve been fairly flexible with us, since we\'re adopting.  Even when we used melatonin in the past (even the timed release), it helped him fall asleep, but not necessarily STAY asleep.      However, surprisingly the sign covering the light switch has worked so far, and this morning it seems he\'s starting to fall back into his regular sleep pattern (slept until 8:00 - wow!!!  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" /> ).
