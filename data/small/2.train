'<P>If your local school district does not have an appropriate placement for your son, it is INCUMBENT on them to negotiate with the nearest school district that DOES. Then, YOUR school district pays tuition to THEIR school district. Another option would be to get the services of an autism consultant on your son\'s IEP and send the consultant regularly to this independent school. SOme states allow the school district to send help to private schools. SOme don\'t. The other option,you have already mentioned. The local Catholic school. I find that really interesting because the Catholic schools around here (Long Island, NY) are notoriously bad with any kind of learning disability or neurobiological disorder. However, things are different in different parts of the country. One option that you might not have thought of is to do exactly what this private school asks you to do. The advantage to that over homeschooling is that it won\'t take any more effort than homeschooling, your son will be in a situation where other children are available as role models (if he learns from imitation) and potential social partners, he\'ll stay used to going outside the home to school and you will be doing this school and this teacher an ENORMOUS favor by modeling for THEM and essentially giving them a free education. </P> <P>We parents of kids on the spectrum get \"taught\" by our kids SO much that we often forget that the things we learn to take for granted (like obsessions and transition issues) are foreign things to teachers and parents of typical kids. It\'s really only been in the last 4 or 5 years that schools have been getting SPECIAL ED teachers who have the slightest clue about autism. We on this board all live in a world where ASD issues are the norm. That is not so outside our world, so when we put our children INTO the outside world, clashes of culture take place. There is no other way to put it. Sometimes it\'s worth it and workable. Sometimes not. Only you can decide based on the current situation and what realistic options you have. Personally, I believe home teaching autistic kids goes against what they need most - being with peers. Not necessarily just because peers model for them (many ASD kids wouldn\'t notice if the model were modelling on their NOSE!) but to learn to simply TOLERATE being in the world We parents quickly learn what the world will tolerate from them. AND what it won\'t. This is a hard but important lesson for everyone.</P>'
'I have just started so I have no long term feedback to give. I am happy to <br />have decided to do it, because our SD was so horrible. <br /> <br />A reminder to everyone considering homeschooling, you will not lose out <br />on those related services. School districts must provide them to you by <br />law, and also to kids in private schools, too. In other words, you can still <br />have an IEP and receive services while homeschooling. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to beautiful 10-yr old twin girls,1 w/Autism, 1 NT(w/ speech delays to age 5)</div>'

'<P>Amber.</P> <P>I too have the same problems that you are having. My sons diet is made up of mostly pizza. He eats a whole pizza to himself. He also likes spaghetti but the only foods he will feed himself is pizza, cookies, preztle rods and he only want\'s to drink sprite. I cannot get him to drink much of anything else. I have tried to pour water, juice you name it into his sprite can but he knows the difference and will spit it out or gag like he is going to vomit. As for sitting at the table no way!!<BR>I have to chase him for every bite. Lately I have refused and he has been coming to me for a bite that has helped alot. He does not use utinsels so I have to feed him or he would simply starve and if he does not like what we are having he will lead me to the pizza oven and if I do not make him one he will get mad and bite, scratch and pinch at me. I found it easiest to feed him his morning oatmeal with his meds. while sitting in the bath in the morning rather than chasing him down. I have found frozen pizza\'s lined up on my table already and he has even opened some and part of them raw while I was busy about the house. He has even gotten into the grocery bags while on the way home when I stopped for gas. He sure loves his pizza.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Tina mom of 14yr old non verbal, severely autistic son CJ</div>'
'<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>I had my first conversation with one of the principals of the 3 middle schools to choose from. It\'s a smaller MS that has no kids that my son grew up with (so no past bad memories there). They\'ve had experience with some Asperger students (pro\'s and con\'s). My son\'s teacher is excited to go tour it with me next week. If it works out they\'re talking about tryint to start the process after christmas break. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>I compleletely agree that I\'m probably more scared than my son is. The principal told me to make sure to come armed with as many questions as possible. Has anyone else gone through this process? What should I ask, and what should I look for?</FONT></P>'
'<P>My caseload is really small right now, unless you count the gifted population that I currently work with once a week. I don\'t do advocating for families in my school system. I have some that know me and call me for advice, and I give them that. But when it comes to \"getting help\" I refer them to someone else who holds a teaching certificate in special education, but does not teach right now. She is able to actually go to IEP meetings with students in my county whereas, obviously, I am not able to. If I have parents who do call me, and I think they have valid concerns, then I call the sp ed coordinator and let her know I have received the call. My sister in law is an assistant principal here and she calls from time to time to ask questions and get advice. Other than that, most of the families I have contact with in that way are in no way related to my school district. </P> <P>I have always had an interest in special education law and do alot of research in that area. That is usually what I get asked about. Something like \"can they do this\" or \"they told me that\" or \"my child is not getting\" or \"they told me I had to\", etc. I am able to help out in that way. </P> <P>I will have to say that in the 10 years I have been a special ed teacher, I have said some really inappropriate things and been called on those things. I had to learn real fast that I worked for the shcool district and not the parents. That was hard because the college I graduate from gave my graduating class lots of opportunities to be involved in cases of advocating and I was used to doing that. I had to really learn that I had to take care of myself and my students as far as my system was concerned so that I didn\'t have to disagree with what administrators wanted to do. I had to gently push them in the right direction in some instances. </P> <P>Thank you for your kind words.</P>'

I repeated 2nd grade 2 times due to behavior and I guess everyone felt it was better to stay in the class another year. This was in the years 1988-1989. Obviously some things have changed in the time, but the funding issue definatly has not I am sure. I must say transition from spec ed to mainstream was tough. granted I was obviously different from the other kids in the class. I was totally treated differently all through elementary school, grade 5-6 was mainstream and obviosly the teachers knew. I had decent teachers, but I feel I was treated differently, often seperated from the rest of the class only because of a minor miss behavior. I felt sometimes I was not treated as fairly as everyone else in the class. So ya its a double edged sword. I guess its better (my opinion only) to let the school know, in fact they may know cause of school records anyways that must legally be transfired from what I understand. Their are other parents on this board that know alot more about this then I do and hopefully one will respond. Nowdays their are things offered to ASD kids, when I little in the 1980\'s and growing up in the 90\'s their was NOTHING avalible for kids like me other then special ed. It helped the school cause they got their funding plus being seperate from NT classes meant I would not give the teacher a hard time. From what I understand when I was mainstreamed many of the teachers I was originally suppose to be in class and they did not want me <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"> . The school put me with different teachers and mom and dad even told me I should behave and do my best because it was difficult to get a teacher who would just accept me in their mainstream class. Nowdays your ASD kiddo can benifit wayyyy better because of whats avalible and knowledge that was not known when I was a kiddo myself. Only you know what is right and just be awair that the school does not always have you or your kiddo\'s best interests in mind. Sometimes they may fight ya because of funding or what is easier on teachers. Definatly do your reacherch, read what other parents write on here since they have more knowledge then I do in this subject, and be prepaired for a fight if the school is not doing what you think is right. I have been here myself, or at least my mom and dad, they fought for years and wished to this day they coulda done more for me, but the school prevented it.

Jeeze... thats a tough question, I saw a 40 min vid a year later at my parents 4th of july party in 1987, I was by not means typical, and avoided the other kids at the party but the adults seemed to enjoy my presence. I was shocked to see how decent my speech was, I actually sounded intelligent, like an older kid would sound. <br /> <br />But at 3.5? I really have no clue cause at that time mom and dad did not know I had HFA. Mom grew up with only another sister and never knew what a typical boy should act like, and dad worked alot and is more aspie then I am so even if I asked they would not have an ability to compair me and tell me what things were like. <br /> <br />I guess I never asked about things back then. I was always interested in the years after that, they know more about that after the DX. <br /> <br />Ya, I know I was quite tempermental myself. Well personally I see no way fighting the DX will be helpful to you and your son. Mom and dad accepted it when I was DX\'ed but thought during the teen years I was magicly cured. They are not up with the current understanding of things. My mom and dad definatly let me be myself, to an extent, behaviors were corrected my parents were a bit heavy fisted as far as punsihments go. I turned out alright certainly not because of the school. Mom and Dad did their best with what they had at the time. I learned right and wrong, how to behave somewhat but I think at least for me my ASD was mild enough that during those times I was allowed to just go out and live a normal life, as much as possible. SO I went around the neghboorhood and just lived kinda like a normal kid, and had lots of other kids my age to do stuff with. I think the individual with the ASD is the most important factor, you never know who will do good and who wont, but if its mild enough and parents do what they feel is right, I think most of these higher functioning individuals will do just fine, but it may look real rough when they are little. Like everybody else ASD kids will grow, learn, adapt and develope. Its a tough world out their for us, but its a world that I think many of the kids on here as well as your son can survive in and i think many of these kids like your son will surprise ya with how they do during the teen and adult years, and I really mean that.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- DX\'ed with HFA as a child.

'I called to start mediation again this morning. I also called the Oregon helpline to see if they had a list of lawyers that deal specifically with Sped issues. <br><br>The IEP is for the team to decide placement for Mason, although at yesterdays meeting they were pretty clear that this classroom is the only one for my son. Even after I was adamant that he wouldn\'t be returning, the Sped Director told me that they still may come to the conclusion that the classroom I pulled him from is the only appropriate choice.<br><br>They are making it a double whammy, with his tri anual eval coming up.......it will be long and if the last few meeting are an indicator, a complete waste of my time and energy. Nothing has been accomplished since the day I pulled him out of school except they have decided that nithing happened and that I will not be aloud to see any of the incident reports, the privacy of the school employees is covered by law, but not my son.<br><br>I want to call and tell them that I will not be at this IEP, that I am tired of them wasting my time. If they can meet and come to me with some form of acceptable solution great, if not? Mediation. I really don\'t want to go be treated like I am over reacting anymore, it makes me second guess myself. I know what I saw and I know that it isn\'t ok, I don\'t like being made to doubt that.<br><br><br>'
'<P>Clearly, this placement is inappropriate. The teacher knows exactly zero about autism. Ask that a functional behavioral assessment be performed by a qualified person and that that person create a behavior intervention plan that all school personnel follow. In fact, get the BIP into his IEP. I know that <U>The Explosive Child</U> recommends against behavior modification. However, it\'ll probably be a cold day in Hades before most school districts implement the techniques used in this book. They take patience and individualizing that is really not seen in most schools. A BIP is a MUCH better alternative than what\'s happening now. A teacher who is actually FEEDING INTO his issues. If I were you, I\'d see if the IEP Team would approve a consult from a BCBA for school issues.</P> <P>Also, search this site for the many FBA and BIP suggestions already posted.</P>'
