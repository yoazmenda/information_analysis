' <div class=\"postbody\">Well it started out once every 6 months or so. But that ended after he dropped the ball.  (3 phone consults to teach him bout Chelation.)  Btw donâ€™t think he charged me for the last one.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />     We have only seen our Doc 3xs in 5 years. Prior to that a wonderful Dan!  Nutritionist who gave us the understanding and tools to apply principles of biomed  from ground up.    Long storyâ€¦..But I think I officially fired him after had realized how important it is to continue to learn while your practicing medicine.   It may seem as I have lost my trust in Docs all together. But that is not true, it just is a reality that you need to be proactive or your liable to learn the hard way.  IMO good working relationship is most important, just have not found the right one yet.

'<P><FONT size=2>Sorry to hear about that, Slueth. It must be hard for your parents to have a grandchild who isn\'t \"normal\". But they need to find a way to deal with it. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>My mom and dad really don\'t have much to say about my son\'s disorder. They don\'t know much about Autism, but they don\'t criticize him for his off behavior, either. Probably because I\'m like a mother bear when it comes to my kids. <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley36.gif\" border=\"0\"> My son loves it when they come over to visit, or when we go to their house. He loves to walk around the block with my dad. We don\'t have much of a relationship with my hubby\'s parents. But, I\'m under the impression that they are making an effort to learn about Autism.</FONT></P>'
'I feel like there is no right answer for this situation. Since it is a private preschool they don\'t have to take my son. The director is with me on this, but I feel like the more I push him to take action the more they are going to take it out on my son. This didn\'t start until after the talk of going without an aide for a month came up. He watched the class last week and we are going to talk more. He told the aide that he felt my son was doing very well and needed very little redirection. I\'m half tempted to pull him out of there except that he loves it, is doing well and is started to make friends. And, I don\'t have a back up plan yet. Not to mention the loss of tutor hours he is getting right now. He really loves that school. He has the best smile on school days.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom of 2 boys  4 year old ASD  2 year old ASD</div>'
'My son is required to read X number of books each semester. He is very slow at reading. It is written in his IEP that he only has to do half the requirement. He does some reading with the special ed teacher, but he also does it at home. Depending on what the spec ed is helping him with he may not have time to always do his reading at school. I find it important for Adam to read at home. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Dawn mom of Adam age 14 - PDD NOS, ADD, Anexity disorder. Also two NT kids ages 11 and 9.</div>'
'This is a very funny thread. And do you all realize that what we are <br />experiencing here is NT behavior? ALL kids do this! The difference is <br />that once they know better, our kids have more difficulty controlling their <br />impulse to use a scripted swear phrase. My DS (almost 11) knows he <br />shouldn\'t swear, and we try to be good around him. One of his favorite <br />shows is \"Futurama\" and anyone who has ever seen it knows that Bender, <br />the robot can be pretty crass. This past weekend, DS was over at a <br />friends house. The two boys had a disagreement, and low and behold, DS <br />tells his friend to \"bite my shiny metal ass\". The friend told me about this <br />when I picked up DS. DS was mortified and terrified that he would be in <br />serious trouble. He\'s such a stickler for rules, that he views any violation <br />on his part as grounds for corporal punishment. I wasn\'t mad, and <br />explained to him that what he said was not nice, and he shouldn\'t use <br />that word or speak to his friends that way. He knows right from wrong, <br />but controlling those impulses is another story...<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Karen - Connor, 15, Asperger\'s, ADD & LD & Raymie, 8, NT</div>'
'<P>Hi Barb,</P> <P>Sounds like some similar things to what Im going through right now myself. My son is also in kindergarten and in a ctt class regular ed. My son like Roman is not acting well at all. He has been hitting , throwing things, screaming etc. I think if Im lucky he has 1 good day a week. Even that day is not so great there is some issue like not sitting but not that awful.</P> <P>What kind of class was Roman in for Pre-K? Do you think he can handle the work that they are giving him in the classroom? and at that quicker pace? Also how is his speech? My son seems to handle the work when Im one on one with him but at school going from task to task has been hard for him. Also my son\'s speech is the worst in the class everyone can communicate much better than he can so that doesnt help. Im like you and they have had a behaviorist come in 2 x now. With different recommendations so far nothing has worked.</P> <P>I dont know what an fba or a bip are.... Anyway keep us updated with what is going on. Im in the same situation and very stressed!!!</P> <P>Sharmyn</P>'

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">1.We brush at every diaper change - so approx every 2/3 hours. Though in truth it\'s usually closer to 3... shhhhhh.... don\'t tell the OT!   2. We do therapeutic listening once in the am for 30 min. once in the pm for 3o minutes. (just started this)   3. Aidan wears a weighted vest for a half hour before ABA sessions.   4. swinging - during each (or when there is time before each) ABA session (just under 10 minutes each time) and after dinner   5. jumping - tramp is out for spontaneous use - I usually encourage him to jump before sessions or any other time where concentration/focus is expected.   6. tactile - We incorporate tactile activities into ABA - examples - we taught colors with fingerpainting/ colored sand - when working on drawing - circles, crosses we used shaving cream - rice bin/water table for in/out - empty/full - playdough-we do lots of turn taking but really we can incorporate anything with playdough.   7. deep pressure throughout the day - squishing in pilllows, squeezing. We have done ABA sessions (when we felt like he was really needing input) - in the couch. One time when we were doing yes/no we put him in the couch and asked him if he wanted more pillows. We could have run that all day and he would have been delighted.   8. Spinning - spin in his chair during ABA and sometimes they pick him up and spin him as a reinforcer. In total I would guess he gets about 20 minutes or so total daily spinning time.   8. Heavy work once am, once afternoon, once before bed. Usually I give him things to carry up the stairs or have him push/pull wagons full of heavy stuff.   9. Before bedtime we drag him up and down the carpeted hallway while wrapped up in a blanket. </div>    Outside of our \'world\', wouldn\'t this sound like some kind of Taliban torture method (especially 3, 8 and 9)?</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #400080\">Bill</span> <span style=\"color: #FF8000\">Aly 16;Dillan 14;Jason 11 Liv 8 ASD Grace 6 PDD</span> <span style=\"color: #FF0000\">and Linda</span></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Bill</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Ok, so lately I\'m on here venting about every other day. i guess I\'m just going through a rough time.     My latest challenge to is find NT kids to come over and spend about an hour at our house during ABA so Joey can have some good peer models in his sessions and work on social skills.  I asked one of the moms at school and she gave me about 10 different reasons why she didn\'t want her daughter to participate, the main reason being that she is just so shy and she didn\'t feel she would do well . ..I mean, maybe I\'m just oversensitive to all of this, but this is a very normal 5 year old with great manners, great speech, and all we want is for her to come over and model for Joey. This mom just irritated me to no end - and this was as she was picking her up from a play date at another child\'s home which she said was ok because  \"she knows\" this little girl well and is comfortable with her. She is in class with Joey 3 days a week and knows him too!     I guess I feel I\'m teetering between wanting to understand and believe this mom and feeling like  she\'s just blowing us off because she doesn\'t want her daughter at our home involved in helping with this or with my son because he is autistic.  I guess it\'s too much to expect of people, but it just sort of stinks that they can\'t be more understanding. These are all stay at home moms with the time to do it.     A couple of other moms have been willing, so I will ask them, but this one just left me with a huge headache. This is all so emotionally hard, and hard to wonder if people truly are being discriminatory or not.  Maybe I am internalizing things and taking people\'s comments the wrong way. I don\'t know. I feel as if I need counseling for all of this myself.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Joey, 6 yrs., PDD-NOS  GFCF, Yasko, RDI  Did ABA for 14 mos.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Joey, 6 yrs., PDD-NOS  GFCF, Yasko, RDI  Did ABA for 14 mos.</div>'
