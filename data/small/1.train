'You know when we too our DD to the autism clinic they has no doubt that she was autism before they sent us for the more extensive testing. When we went for the extensive testing the only thing that put her as PDD/NOS over Classic Autism was the fact that she is somewhat social. She looks for affection and is overly affectionate at times. Yet we got a dx for her without any problems. Now Fast Fwd 3yrs from her DX and My son who is quite a bit more severe. Has a Classic Autism DX. When we took him to the intial appt for him to be evaluated to see if she would test him. She told us NO hes not ASD, Developemental delays 6 mon of OT and ST and Ill see you back and eval again. When she came in the room the first appt she said Hi brad he turned and looked and it seemed like everything we said she blew off. In July we went to the 2nd eval. She dx with classic autism with regression. She said that it was more apparent to her the day we went in the 2nd time. I read alot about how hard it is for girls to get asd dx. but i honestly think that anymore its just the oppisite. It seemed like she was more sceptical about my son than when she dx my daughter. My son is soo much more severe and it gets me that it worked out that way. I would seek out a 2nd oppinion. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Angie Mom to-  Tessa 10-ADHD  Kora 8- NT  Veroniqua 6-PDD/NOS,ADHDAsthma  Brad Jr 2- Classic ASD with Regression</div>'
'LMAO- sorry this is off topic but hilarious. It is almost like the IEP team with the lowest skills gravitates to the families who are most informed. <br>I am a special ed teacher. Why on earth would my son\'s case manager even dream of walking into an IEP meeting with the IEP already written????? He does know what I do for work.... let\'s add that my son\'s dad is a psychiatrist. <br><br>'
'Hi and welcome! <br /> <br />It\'s great that you\'re looking out for this little guy, and hopefully, he\'ll get an <br />evaluation and help, if he needs it. <br /> <br />I just want to say though, and I don\'t mean to sound harsh, but if you were <br />babysitting MY kid, and you posted about him on an autism board AND <br />posted his photo, without my consent or knowledge, I\'d be livid, and <br />definitely get a new sitter... <br /> <br />You may want to take that photo down out of your siggy.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Donny 13 - classic autism, bipolar</div>'
'im looking for other boards that are active like this one.'
'The private placement they looked at primarily services people with down syndrome and it is really important for them (THIS IS THEIR WORDS) They want him to be with his people. The other placement is fine as far as they are concerned.....just not enough students with his level of down syndrome. i did get an email from dad that they are sorry if they are putting me in a bad position, but that I am always such a cheerleader for their child and needed that support. I will meet with them in person next week and see what happens. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Tricia - NY  Mom to John 10 -ASD & Paige - 6 (but going on 20)  A BCBA creating an autism program from the ground up!!</div>'
'You are braver than I am, I still won\'t eat brussels sprouts. Ugh. But, at age <br />almost 7, my son is a lot less picky. He even ate a curry last night, with lots <br />of veggies. I about fell out of my chair from shock. I never thought we would <br />move past chicken nuggets. I don\'t know if it\'s age, exposure to new things <br />gradually, help from his OT with sensory stuff, or all of the above. Whatever, <br />I am just so darn grateful! <br /> <br />Harriet<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to Ravi, ASD and Stirling, NT    For I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep.</div>'
'I\'m glad you came here to vent, it always helps me to get my frustrations out on here. I agree with tzoya, counseling will help, I go twice a week to deal with things in my life and from my past, it does truly help to be able to talk to somebody and have them help you be able to deal with whatever life throws at you. Don\'t get me wrong I still have a lot of days where I\'m depressed and angry and worried about ds\'s future, but I would truly seek some form of counseling.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Candy, Mother of 2 wonderful children:    Jade: 8 and NT    Leo: 7 and Autistic</div>'

'<P>hmmm, in varying degress I think that kids show different signs. Like my ds has never lined things up. He only needs a verbal routine in the morn and he is good (just like you would with any k:, so today we are going to be doing this and this). If I miss something he gets upset, but after lots and lots of talking, all is good. Although what you suggested are classic, it doesn\'t mean every child will display that behaviour... there is just a higher chance.</P> <P>The stims I have found... was he needed deep pressure on his feet. I only figured this out because his room was always a mess and he couldn\'t sleep without it being messy.... It took a bit of hit and miss, but he needed to walk on his toys to get the feeling on his feet to calm down. Now I figured it out, I have things in place so we can have a quasi-clean room. Without looking closely at this, it could have looked like a power struggle and a child not wanting to clean his room (lol, that was part of it too :P)</P> <P>Or eating specific foods... appears to be a picky eater, but if you dig a little deeper, it could be an oral stim. If the child will only eat crunchy food, they make like the sounds or not eating crunchy, the sound could hurt thier ears.</P> <P>Visual could be looking at something from the side of thier eyes. Or getting overwhelmed by lots of visual stimuli that the child loses control and it shows up as the child being hyper.</P> <P>Have you read \"out-of-sync child\" It would give you some great insights :)</P> <P>Pan</P>'

When they are faced <br />with that kind of proof, they can\'t sweep it under the rug. What they <br /><em>will</em> do is insist on an evaluation by someone from the school <br />district. This is just a way for them to drag their feet, since it\'s very <br />unlikely that their psychologist will disagree with all of your experts. All <br />part of the game. Play along. After their psychologist confirms the dx, <br />things should start to move along in the right direction.<span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by IBGECKO on July 05 2005 at 1:01pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Karen - Connor, 15, Asperger\'s, ADD & LD & Raymie, 8, NT</div>'
