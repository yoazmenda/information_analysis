My own personal and highly subjective opinion is that freedom is a good thing.  However, when I here people assert that the only "true" freedom is in following the words of this and that Messiah, I realise that people don't even agree on the meaning of the word.  What does it mean to say that word X represents an objective value when word X has no objective meaning?  jon. 
 Thanks to whoever posted this wonderful parody of people who post without  reading the FAQ!  I was laughing for a good 5 minutes.  Were there any  parts of the FAQ that weren't mentioned?

 A while back someone had several equations which could be used for changing 3 f iltered grey scale images into one true color image.  This is possible because it's the same theory used by most color scanners.  I am not looking for the obv ious solution which is to buy a color scanner but what I do need is those equat ions becasue I am starting to write software which will automate the conversion  process.  I would really appreciate it if someone would repost the 3 equations /3 unknowns.   Thanks for the help!!!

First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than    realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a    version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).    I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results    (for better or for worse).     I pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TV    a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where    the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized    a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space    station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between    frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only    5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.     I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot    card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then    imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,    keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled    to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default    "2.00" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten    frames.     I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "Raw Speed Test" program I used    for the results I'd been reporting earlier.     Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.     That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short    test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard    disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate    was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk    (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.     I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional    scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240    size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who    observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in    action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's    entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...     Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.     The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with    "preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played    from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).    A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was    very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with    ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this    much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task    switching.     A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see    any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight    stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.     I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the    key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also    improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance    even more...

(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for "double size" scaling, other scaling factors hit peformance much harder).  (3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices to advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I'm not sure about Premiere).  Any combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size is, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also make a real difference.

It is strange that you mention Josephus, since Wells claims  that historians and theologians widely regard the two mentions in Josephus to be  Christian interpolations.

Duh, gee, then we must be talking Christian mythology now.  I was hoping to discuss something with a reasonable, logical person, but all you seem to have for your side is a repetition of the same boring mythology I've seen a thousand times before. I am deleting the rest of your remarks, unless I spot something that approaches an answer, because they are merely a repetition of some uninteresting doctrine or other and contain no thought at all.  [..]  I have to congratulate you, though, Bill.  You wouldn't know a logical argument if it bit you on the balls.  Such a persistent lack of function in the face of repeated attempts to assist you in learning (which I have seen in this forum and others in the past) speaks of a talent that goes well beyond my own, meager abilities.  I just don't seem to have that capacity for ignoring outside influences.  Dean Kaflowitz

 My wife wants to publish a newsletter. She's no artist, so she intends to use comercial clipart and customise it a bit by drawing a circle or a box around it etc.    We have MSPublisher for manipulating text, but it is not suitable for doing much with graphics, so she needs a more specialised tool. Right now she's looking at Corel Draw and Harvard Draw. There seem to be more books in the stores on Corel than on Harvard, so she's inclined to go with Corel on the basis of popularity. Can anyone give us an informed opinion on which  package would be more suitable or if there is an even better alternative available? If this is a FAQ, please withhold the flames and just send the location of the FAQ document. Thanks.   Three PS's:   1) Is it ok to use clip art from Harvard Draw or whatever for commercial    purposes?   2) We have a 600 dpi Laser Jet 4 printer. What would be a good scanner for    reading in paper clipart?   3) How about someone starting up a newsgroup on desktop publishing if one    doesn't exist?

Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your calculator.  256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is 307,200 which is 300k to be exact.  640x400x256 only takes 250k but I don't think it is a BIOS mode.  I wouldn't bet that all VGA cards can do that either.  If a VGA card has 512k I bet it can do both 640x400 and 640x480.  That by definition is SVGA, though not very high SVGA.

In this case, it is for one that the gospels cannot even agree if it was Jesus who has been seen. Further, there are zillions of other spook stories, and one would hardly consider others even in a religious context to be some evidence of a resurrection.   There have been more elaborate arguments made, but it looks as if they have not passed your post filtering.     >I thus interpret the "extraordinary claims" claim as a statement that the >speaker will not accept *any* evidence on the matter.

 Interesting.  I'd fight the ticket.  First off, there's a 50/50 chance the cop won't show up.  Secondly, if he does show up, you should point out that he lied (purgered) on the ticket.  Why 70+?  I beleive that if yo're charged with going more than 15mph that the posted speed it's a more severe ticket.  You couldn't have p[ossibly been going 70+, right?!  --  |  max@queernet.org  |   Max J.

Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together >for just a few bucks. Heck, the technology is only what? 1,000 years old?  You can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, "The Hungry Hiker's Guide to Good Food," by Gretchen McHugh.  The heat source is a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it's a vertical wooden box with ventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air to flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are spaced every 6" starting about 10" above the bulb.  Or, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use your oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may not have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or racks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my oven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  Stick a wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows for airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it often, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you are using cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway through.

Well, I'd say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murder. For instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain blanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actually performed the action isn't the murderer (but I guess this is actually made clear in the below definition).  >I'd be interested to see a more reasonable definition.

But, even though the series is recursively infinite, I think the meaning can still be deduced.  >I assume you can see the problem here.

For instance, we >can define the factorial function (the function which assigns to a >positive integer the product of the positive integers less than or >equal to it) on the positive integers inductively as follows:  [math lesson deleted]  Okay, let's look at this situation:  suppose there is a longstanding feud between two families which claim that the other committed some travesty in the distant past.  Each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family.  Now, let's suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you don't like dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, there is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty. How do you resolve this?  Well, they are all murders.  Now, I suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your "problem," but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.  And, in any case, the nested "murderer" in the definition of murder cannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity. And, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition?  See, in a totally objective system where all the information is available, such a nested definition isn't really a problem.  keith

I stared straight ahead, unblinking.  A hundred cars were honking.  Eventually he got back into his jeep, face beet-red with anger, and all the rest of the way back to Houston I tailed him,  waving, honking, flipping him off, yelling...

I think of it as "Don't worry, be happy".   For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?   There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses word "on faith", we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now. If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods?   The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing, rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?   I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found.   David Nye (nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu).

Well, one reason for getting conflicting answers is that it depends on what you want the ground plane to do.  A continuous conductor is a good  electrostatic shield.  Do you have signals on your board that need shielding rom other things?  This shielding won't do much good for magnetic fields, unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded, like a Faraday cage.  The flip side of the coin:  if you are working with (very) high impedances, you could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems. You aren't likely to encounter this at 100Hz, but at 20kHz, it can be a real problem (one that bit me once).

Right.  Unfortunately for you, it turned out that my opinions on the matter were entirely consistent in that I condemned the bombing of Dresden too.  I think you're being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing policy, too.  You make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door.  As I understand it, that is not the case; we aimed deliberately at civilian targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the German people.  > civilians suffer.

Carpenter) writes: > >> I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the >> distance between a transmitter(s) and receiver? > >Yes. It's called RADAR. Well, actually not quite. Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances by measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive its reflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimeters use either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case of the latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example, the original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500 feet altitude.  Note, however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster originally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements between a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter triggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actually travel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the difference is called the velocity factor of the cable). So you need to resort to a common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance, etc. Something like a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick, triggering both the transmitter and receiver simultaneously. Sound expensive? Not too bad, but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort.  Why not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where again the reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E. should know about anyway ;-).  >> Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength >> and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft), >> and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.  This is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmitter varies from unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmission line, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unit over time. You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. With the radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at one place, it is much easier to do. Note especially that the time base for the R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also...  >Depends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in >a dynamic environment (with objects moving about) the multipath kills this >concept.  Nope. FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. That is, unless the two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength. This is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes. Signals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong...  >> What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?  As high as possible to eliminate outside influence, and also to enhance attenuation of multipath signals. Radio Altimeters typically use frequencies around 4 GHz.

 Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or contribution to:  In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine.  The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle (even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of the law is no excuse - they will get you too!  It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors.  Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was "no way!"  But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one, and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.  Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.  For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave enlightment may be necessary.  So, the questions are -   What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?   Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by   a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector   antenna?   Are any brands "quieter" than others?  ============================================================================== Randy T. Agee - ARS WB4BZX       | At some point, you probably pondered The  P.O.

I am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable.  The concepts of "right" and "wrong" (or "correct/incorrect" or "true/false") belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).  Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively. One can certainly ask if a percept is "right" (correct, true, veridical) or "wrong" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can certainly ask that question about motives.  Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered: they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.  Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with the first part (that the "rightness" of a moral position is a meaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that one cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the "correctness" of the position.  Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue, neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold different moral values (feelings). ----------------------------------- John A.

I've got the 6.0 spec (obviously since I quoted it in my last posting).

                         Constructing a Logical Argument  Although there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument found is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.  Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise OED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument.  Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job.  Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, "It is raining" or "Today is Tuesday".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to be true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning of "deny", not the everyday meaning.  The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular arrangement of words used to express it.  So "God exists" and "There exists a God" both express the same proposition.  An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, "a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition".  An argument consists of three stages.  First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions.   Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as "because", "since", "obviously" and so on.  (The phrase "obviously" is often viewed with suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to question it.  You can always say "Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious" when you've heard the explanation.)  Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of valid inference.  The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as "implies that" or "therefore".  Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as "therefore", "it follows that", "we conclude" and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.  For example:  Every event has a cause (premise) The universe has a beginning (premise) All beginnings involve an event (premise) This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference) Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)  Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.  Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example, the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated  afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if  sometimes a little confusing.  Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some statements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:  "If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,  or the Son of God."  This is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its  conclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll come to those later.)  Another example:  "God created you; therefore do your duty to God."  The phrase "do your duty to God" is not a proposition, since it is neither true nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an argument.  Finally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form "A because B".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the statement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then it is not an argument, it is an explanation.  For example:  "There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not  start." -- This is an argument.  "My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine."  -- This is an explanation.  There are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions -- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion is true.  An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid; however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments, and about how probable their premises are.  There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.  It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly  counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more carefully.  Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions.  For example:     All insects have wings (premise)    Woodlice are insects (premise)    Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)  Here, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false.  If the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true.  The argument is thus entirely valid.  More subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises, as in:     All fish live in the sea (premise)    Dolphins are fish (premise)    Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)  However, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a "truth table" for implication.  The symbol "=>" denotes implication; "A" is the premise, "B" the conclusion.  "T" and "F" represent true and false respectively.  Premise Conclusion Inference    A        B        A=>B ----------------------------    F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference    F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.     T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion                              false, the inference must be invalid.     T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,                              the conclusion must be true.  A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound  argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments.  To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.  In everyday English the term "fallacy" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair enough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or convincing.  So for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive.  ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)  The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as "might makes right".  The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.  For example: "... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell."  ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM  Argumentum ad hominem is literally "argument directed at the man".  The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.  For example: "Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers."  Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by  showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not argumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's testimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).  The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent's particular circumstances.  For example: "It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue otherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?"  This is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent's argument.  This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For   "Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing.  You're white."  This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is also known as "poisoning the well".  ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM  Argumentum ad ignorantium means "argument from ignorance".  This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true, a basic scientific principle.)  "Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise."  "Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has shown any proof that they are real."  Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty.  Also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can  validly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:  "A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water, even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no such flood occurred."  In science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred, however.  ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM  This is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is  committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a  conclusion accepted.  For example:  "I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me guilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan."  ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM  This is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language.  For example:  "Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women."  "The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?"  ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM  This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more likely it is that that proposition is correct.  ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM  The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion.  For example:  "Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God."  This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly  "Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation" and "John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent  computer"  Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable  whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.  THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT  The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose "accidental" circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific.  For example:  "Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must dislike atheists."  This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.  CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION  This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases.  For example: "Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are insincere."  SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER  A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization.  NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  These are known as False Cause fallacies.  The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For   "I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God cured me of the headache."  The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For   "The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons."  CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.  PETITIO PRINCIPII  This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached.  CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO  This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:  "Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job.  Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open to blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office."  Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the  conclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees.  Another example is the classic:  "We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God."  COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION  This is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded   "Have you stopped beating your wife?"  The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination, when they ask questions like:  "Where did you hide the money you stole?"  Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:  "How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?" or "Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?"  IGNORATIO ELENCHI  The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument  supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion.  For example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.  Sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light.  EQUIVOCATION  Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument.  For example:  "What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable."  AMPHIBOLY  Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing.  ACCENT  Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case, the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized.  For example, consider:  "We should not speak ILL of our friends" and "We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS"  FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION  One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole.  For example:  "The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very  lightweight."  The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:  "A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses."  FALLACY OF DIVISION  The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like its opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:  "You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich."  The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item.  For example:  "Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree."  THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT  This argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful events.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event.  For example: "If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana."  "A IS BASED ON B" FALLACIES / "IS A TYPE OF" FALLACIES  These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.  "Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of history?"  "Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a form of Christianity?"  "Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?"  AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, B is true, therefore A is true".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for implication given earlier.  DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy.  Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has the form "A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false", where A does NOT in fact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is invalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about B.  CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL  This fallacy is an argument of the form "If A then B, therefore if B then A".  ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM  This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old, or because "that's the way it's always been."  ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM  This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else.  ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM  The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those with more money are more likely to be right.  ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM  The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam.  ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM  This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard.  An "argumentum ad nauseum" is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something.  BIFURCATION  Also referred to as the "black and white" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist.  PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS  This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question.  NON SEQUITUR  A non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it.  RED HERRING  This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the points being made, towards a different conclusion.  REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION  Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.  SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF  The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.  STRAW MAN  The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position, then to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made.  THE EXTENDED ANALOGY  The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two  different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a  claim that those situations are analogous to each other.  This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about  anti-cryptography legislation:  "I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it."  "Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported  Martin Luther King."  "Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the  struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!"  TU QUOQUE  This is the famous "you too" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:  "You're just being randomly abusive." "So?  You've been abusive too."

Yes, but... the minimization of gates is important in part because of TIMING considerations.  A TTL gate has the basic structure of AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization.  	A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has TWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term) so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can  be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world. ECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/AND gate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true and inverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).  	PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERT gates (with your choice of internal connections between the various sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sum of products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into  a few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization of logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you to do so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelist with 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description of a logic cell array to do the same job.  Xilinx's XACT software does this by treating each logic block as a macro, and expanding it all out, then simplifying.  	John Whitmore

I use 74HC4066 and others commerically for this purpose so rest assured it  works fine. In one case I route bit serial digital audio using these and it  is difficult to see any signal degradation at all which surprised me given  some pretty fast edges. HC4066 is spec'd at something like -3dB @ 200MHz into  50 ohms. The more complex types are generally a little slower and more  resistive.  Plain 4000 series are not so good at handling 5v logic.  Remember that the output load is seen by the input device.    TC.      E-mail: tchannon@black.demon.co.uk or tchannon@cix.compulink.co.uk

Yes, and then you can suffer the consequences in our collective decision to incarcerate you for that act. Morality is not a necessity for a functional collection of peoples, just a set of acceptable behaviours (is this the same thing?).  There is no universal moral standard as there are many different situations in which collections of social organisms find themselves. Some species of bees see nothing wrong with kicking out a large number of male bees because they are being a burden on the food supplies of the colony. The bees die of course, but it was for the good of the colony as a whole, so was it immoral?   Our society (at least our western one) is one of abundance when it comes to the basics; food, water and shelter.  Therefore our moral standards are based upon those circumstances.  Unfortunately we enforce our moral standards on collections of peoples who are not in similar situations, because we believe in some "universal morality".  What I am saying is that, yes, you CAN still murder my sibling, but don't expect your peers to be impressed by it in our society. However in some other circumstances, it may actually be a "moral" thing to do (in which case it wouldn't be called murder, probably sacrifice). After the act, you could say what you liked, but you must make a conscious decision on whether or not your society will condone your act, so as to evaluate the consequences to yourself, including how you will feel about it (remember your feelings have been socially imbued).

A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of  that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than  you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the  printer. (I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the  printer)  A sage said to me: "Do you want one copy or lots of copies?", "One",  "Inkjet".   > Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the > life of the printer.

Long term the laserprinter  will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that  are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.  HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the  software package has no inkjet driver.   There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a  page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a  laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers  actually use this facility. (there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on)    TC.

We were having a problem with instability in the universal gravitational constant that day:  the closer I got to those exposed fangs (still dripping, no doubt, with the viscera of the last foolhardy experimenter cum canine psychology) the bigger and heavier the dog appeared to become.  Also,  recall that the distribution of the ~150lb is one five pound jaw+teeth  operated by two 70lb muscles driven by a .005 ounce brain possessing an instinctual heuristic composed of equal parts of bloodlust and ravening hunger. The other ~5 lb is, of course, dog poop, but that varies all over the place  as the dog deposits it regularly on the painstakingly manicured and tended  lawns of the dog's owner's neighbors (whilst continuously replenishing its inexhaustible supply, no doubt by consuming the likes of folks like me).  > You have, I presume, thumbs? Grapple with it and tear it's head > off!  My very thought at the time, but as I looked down at these once formidable  instruments of mayhem, I realized they had become weak and atrophied by too many sedentary hours tapping away at my ergonomically-correct CRT keyboard. There was only one option left: I reached down to the toolbox near my car and grasped my Craftsman 150 ft-lb torque wrench, surely the bludgeon of dire necessity if ever there was one.  To my amazement and confusion, the setter started shaking and rolling on the grass, then leapt to its feet and vanished down the street, still quivering and occasionally  looking back at me.    "Seven at One Blow!" I exclaimed, flexing my new-found biceps and brandishing my Terrible Weapon of Invincibility as I stalked the now-secure environs of my domicile.  It was only later that I found out what the dog apparently knew all along: the wrench was defective, would no longer measure torque accurately, and Sears wouldn't fix it or replace it.

  	Greetings. I've recently decided to chuck the linear regulators 	and learn the "black magic" art of switching power supplies... 	(before anyone flames me, I KNOW, both have their place :-)  	Anyways, I've built the basic up & down converters with pretty 	good results (>80% efficiency) but I'm running into problems 	when I try to design & build anything that puts out serious 	amps... I know it can be done (I have some 5V@200A guts on my 	bench) but something puzzles me: I'm using a simple choke as  	the storage element (basicly a toroid with a single winding) 	but ALL commercial models use transformers with MANY windings. 	I traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for 	the usual error/feedback but some of the others seem to loose 	me... What are they for? Better than that, anyone have a full 	schematic for one of these that I could get a copy of? I'd 	love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such 	low volume :-)  	My other problems (in getting high amps & good efficiency) are 	1) Lack of sources of ideal components (calculated) and 2) 	Limited knowledge of the whole topic... I'm doing this on my 	own (not school) mind you (in fact, I have yet to take any 	course that covers transistors ;-)  	So, is the answer to #1 the accumulation of dead commercial 	models and truning into a scavanger (not that it's not what 	I'm doing now...) and #2 getting & understanding schematics 	and a bit more of the [mind-boggling] theory?   	Take care.  	P.S. My goal is 12V @ ~25A in (car battery) -> 250VAC out and 	(on the other end) 250V -> +5VDC @ 5A, -5V @ 1A, +12VDC @8A 	and -12VDC @1A... the distance between the two will be 	more than 100 feet (of 14-16 gauge) but less than 300 feet.

I suspect that the stories are just that, stories.  The voltage can only be sucked down so far instantaneously. When you try to jumpstart someones  car, when your vehicle is at idle, does your car stall? No, the other car just does not crank well.  Now, the engine might stall because the idle was too low to start with. When the extra current is drawn, the idle speed will drop - as the alternator loads down the engine to compensate for the increased amperage requirement.   A transmitter is not going to be affecting house power. If surges are occurring there, it is due to another cause - not a transmitter.   It is probably not that much of a problem. Often - toroid coils on the power leads will solve that part of the interference problem. It will not solve internal equipment deficiencies.   It is probably not the transmitter that is at fault. If the person is an amateur, then he/she will probably be willing to help - if you explain that the person is causing interference.  Bill

THe digital side?  TTL? ECL?  We run 200MHz and 100MHz all over our IC test equipment  all day long in the ECL domain, and we use DIP's along with PLCC's, 25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin QFP's to name a few.  I don't see a problem in packaging as long as you adhere to sound engineering practices.    A good source of information is Motorola's MECL System Design Handbook. The latest ed. is dated 2/88.  That is considered to be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design.  The very fact that you need to build a test fixture means you're most likely going to need a socket.  It in itself has far more inductance per pin than the package you are testing, not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  I don't see the big concern over the packaging because it probably isn't going to make that much difference  If you're trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz, have fun... TTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment.  aaron  P.S. My opinions have nothing to do with my company...the standard disclaimer applies.

One must approach the Qur'an with intelligence.  Any thinking approach to the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals.  I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in the after-life)?  I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the part saying "For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward" says they have souls.    (If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then  I have no idea _what_ a soul is.)  As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to give all verses of the Qur'an equal priority.  That is because, according to Muslim belief, the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact, denying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in Islam.  >Quite similar to you other post, even when the Quran does not encourage >slavery, it is not justified to say that iit forbids or puts an end to >slavery. It is a non sequitur.  Look, any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence and thought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the Quran's message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly answer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings it can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that since women can clearly be "forgiven" and "rewarded" they _must_ have souls (from the above verse).  Let's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach, rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations  fully consistent are more limited.  Let's try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try to twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but provides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.

 Greetings netters,  Steve writes ... <about Cobra Locks>  Well I have the mother of all locks. On Friday the 16th of April I took possesion of a 12' Cobra Links lock, 1" diameter. This was a special order.  I weighs a lot. I had to carry it home and it was digging into my shoulder after about two blocks.  I have currently a Kryptonite Rock Lock through the front wheel, a HD padlock for the steering lock, a Master padlock to lock the cover to two front spokes, and the Cobra Links through the rear swing arm and around a post in an underground parking garage.  Next Friday the 30th I have an appointment to have an alarm installed on me bike.  When I travel the Cobra Links and the cover and padlock stay at home.  By the way. I also removed the plastic mesh that is on the Cobra Links and encased the lock from end to end using bicycle inner tubes (two of them) I got the from bicycle dealer that sold me the Cobra Links. The guys were really great and didn't mark up the price of the lock much and the inner tubes were free.  Later.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992 FXSTC                            Rock 'N Roll Mike Mychalkiw HOG                                   Ryerson Polytechnical Institute - DoD #665 Just THIS side of HELL.

 I'm a mac user who wants to use some of the rayshade models I've built using macrayshade (rayshade-M) with Stratavision 3d.  Since Stratavision can import many different model files I thought this would be a cinch... but I haven't been able to find a simple translator that will work on the mac.  Any ideas?  Stratavision 3d should be able to import:  DXF MiniCAD Super 3d Swivel 3d professional  out of the box and:  RIB IGS  with externals.  Also, if anyone knows of any other translator externals available for Stratavision 3d (esp. Rayshade!) please e-mail me!  BTW, I'm going to send mail to the rayshade usrs mailing list tomorrow (I misplaced the address) but since most users of rayshade do not seem to operate with macs, I'm not getting my hopes up...  thanks in advance,  --patrick.                hurh@fnal.fnal.gov

I would recommend you to take a look at  1) your dictionary 2) alt.atheism FAQ files  to notice that atheism is _not_ a belief system, and what is common to all atheists is not a belief, but a _lack of belief in deities_. I cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without paying careful attention to this issue.   > First of all, I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a > variety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; it's possible to give  > succinct answers to most everything, but there's enough here to keep most of  > you typing for hours, I'm sure.

If you are surveying our individual philosophies, fine, but that's not strictly atheism. Atheism is not just another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life, the universe and everything. It is not a belief system, and it could hardly be called a philosophical system.  Once more: Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities.  Do not twist the meaning, or assume that we have some kind of philosophy we all agree on.  Some comments on your questions:  > What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during) > your "conversion" to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism > counts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)    I would also like to hear more about this. Have we been able to 'convert' anyone?  > Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational > means (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least  > in part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?    This question contains a contradiction in terms. _Beliefs_  cannot be acquired rationally - if they could, they would not be  beliefs! You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become atheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily become atheists, they just think very little about religion. It seems it requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that religions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities.  Those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question quite odd - how can lack of belief be acquired? When did I acquire lack of belief in the Easter Bunny? (I did believe in Santa, though ;-))  > To what extent do you feel you "understand" the universe through your  > beliefs? What phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything > from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human > affairs) do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where > are they lacking as an explanatory method?    This question does not make any sense, since atheism does not deal with these issues - it is not a worldview, or a philosophy, or a belief system.  Sigh, why haven't I seen a good, well-thought survey in the Usenet for three years... and what is the point of doing surveys in the net, anyway? Just to abstract some opinions?

 Jim Perry (perry@dsinc.com) wrote:   Jim,  There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is determnined. This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about- an event can have value.  The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment, from teaching, training, observation and experience and are only significant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical activity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a hill. How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to establish your values. Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any "absolute" sense. That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been conditioned; there is no "truth" content. The whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality. I didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and to be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human thought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil, etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no weight whatsoever.

The only place the neutral should be connected to the ground is in a SERVICE DISCONNECT!  In your house the "main" panel serves as the service disconnect.  Sub panles in your garage or workshop for example must maintain seperate neutral and ground busses because they are not  service disconnect equipment.

Not all > of us have about 200 floppies around for backup, you know.    	Actually, no I don't have a tape drive.  In the event of a total hard disk failure, I reinstall the apps from originals, and restore the data from the backups I keep of that.  With upwards of 100Mb of stuff on my hard disk, there is no way I'm going to try and back it all up without a tape drive. :)  Would be nice to have one though!  > RAM is something you add all the time, so no.  It's more like BIOS > manufacturer and/or processor type (386/486/etc).  Data cannot be used, > esp with these new Flash ROM BIOS machines with updates on a diskette.  	Maybe, maybe not.  Today it doesn't happen as often (I would hope), but then if a BIOS is buggy and the user gets an upgrade, the BIOS information is going to change, at least the date anyway.  Tagging the BIOS manufacturer is still going to falsely tag those users who upgrade the motherboard.  This type of upgrade doesn't require a hard disk backup/restore.  > On the other hand, to make this LESS intrusive it could be disguised as > "Please Insert Original Disk #XX as I need file YYYYYY for update".  :-)  > It would be perfectly reasonable...

Your scheme isn't going to stop anyone.   > Of course it is easier.  Are you saying then the originals SHOULD allow > only one install?  What is your point?  	Of course not.  If something gets corrupted and my app needs to be reinstalled, the *worst* thing I want that software telling me is "this software has already been registered to <blank> and it is against the law to install it on other machines."  Or something similar; Access for Windows does this and it only requires a click on "OK" to go away.  Pretty non-intrusive, but it gets the point across.  > What I said was the program should have certain restriction (such as the > restrict-to-one-machine) UNTIL the program is registered with the > manufacturer.

This is a great idea.  I like the key system that some shareware products use.  The only problem is that it will be difficult for big software companies to implement this without it getting very cost-ineffective for them and more of a burden than a benefit to the users.  -- Steve Madsen sjmadsen@nextsrv.cas.muohio.edu  Ask me about Linux, the free 386 unix!

Article-I.D.: news.C5J34y.2t4   Yo, did anybody see this run of HARD COPY?  I guy on a 600 Katana got pulled over by the Police (I guess for speeding or something).  But just as the cop was about to step out of the car, the dude punches it down an interstate in Georgia. Ang then, the cop gives chase.  Now this was an interesting episode because it was all videotaped!!! Everything from the dramatic takeoff and 135mph chase to the sidestreet battle at about 100mph.  What happened at the end?  The guy (who is being relentless chased down box the cage with the disco lights) slows a couple of times to taunt the cop.   After blowing a few stop signs and making car jump to the side, he goes up a dead end street.  The Kat, although not the latest machine, is still a high performance machine and he slams on the brakes.  Of couse, we all know that cages, especially the ones with the disco lights, can't stop as fast as our high performance machines.  So what happens?...  The cage plows into the Kat.  Luckily for this dude, he was wearing a helmet and was not hurt.  But dude, how crazy can you get!?!  Yeah, we've all went out and played cat and mouse with our friends but, with a cop!!???!!!  How crazy can you get!?!?!  It took just one look at a ZX-7 who tried this crap to convince me not to try any shit like that.  (Although the dude collided with a car head on at 140 mph, the Kawasaki team colors still looked good!!!  Just a few scratches, like no front end.... 3 inch long engine and other "minor" scratches...)  If you guys are out there, please, slow it down.  I not being an advocate for the cages (especially the ones that make that  annoying ass noises...), but just think...  The next time you punched it (whether you have an all mighty ZX-11 or a "I can do it" 250 Ninja), just remember, a kid could step out at any    time.  Peace & ride (kinda) safe.

Thanks. >   The GL file is an archive containing individual frames or pieces of frames (usually stored as .PIC or .CLP files), fonts, and a .TXT file that tells the GRASP animation system how to display it.  GL stands for Grasp Library.  There is probably a detailed discussion of this subject in the alt.binaries.pictures FAQ.  There are freely distributable viewers for GL files, and they are usually named GRASPRT?.EXE (replace the ? with a version digit or letter).  Most GL files contain frames that are hardware-specific to particular modes of the CGA, EGA, or VGA adapters on PCs.  I think that there are some copies of GRASPRT available by anonymous ftp (I know that I got one there a long time ago).

 Sorry for wasting your time with a probably simple question, but I'm not an computer graphic expert. I want to read TIFF-Files with a PASCAL-program. The problem is, that the files I want to read are in compressed form  ( code 1, e.g. Huffman ). All books & articles I found describe only the plain (uncompressed) format. I don't know where to get the original TIFF specification, furthermore I haven't any access to a realy complete library. Can anybody direct me to a good book or (even better) to an  specification available via ftp ?  Thanks in advance - Thomas Wolf

Doubting something does not imply affirming the contrary.  Funny, we've been here before.  What was the issue last time?  It is, of course, logically reasonable to doubt X even when you have no evidence of not-X.  Carry on doubting everything you want.

Some of these people say, "I was abducted, experimented on, etc." If we insist that these aliens don't exist is the burden of proof placed on us.

 Just one little thing. Last year, mid-december, a cop pulled me over. It  was about -10 Centigrade, and it just started snowing (O.K. you are right, I  live in Canada). The cop checked my license, insurance, ownership, looked at  my frozen nose and fingers, told me to watch the speed limit more closely,  and, entering his cruiser, told me, I was doing 68 instead of 50 km/h.  Didn't ticket me, and I REALLY slowed down after that ( I already mentioned  it started to snow. )          Safe riding, Stefan. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Stefan Ruhl  german exchange student.  ...  come out on a Honda,  if you can get it running.  
 John Ackermann x 2966 (jra@law7.DaytonOH.NCR.COM) wrote:        What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the 10th ARRL Computer Network Conference proceedings.    I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz. The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.    The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used at these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design of this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).    While using this would have let me reduce the "external" IF count on receive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I didn't bother with it.    The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2 MHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios actually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and speed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data stream is another matter entirely.    Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a "beacon" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO also shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even though the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes of the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of a second.    I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the proceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running low on resources of time, money and energy.    If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW ID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma Mtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally polarized.    I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and you might want to carefully consider your "target".  If you can't arrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think you'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by multipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS. For more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread spectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems. I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.  73 Glenn Elmore n6gn  N6GN @ K3MC       amateur IP:	glenn@SantaRosa.ampr.org

Article-I.D.: hippo.1993Apr16.105738.20864   I own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no   amp which can touch it at the price range. The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other    amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid   with massive heat sinks and very solid casing. If you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components    in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect   symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each   channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are   virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.  I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east   or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components   they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the   amplifiers sound so brilliant. I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with   those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly   hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.  My last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like   the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded   like new.  If you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will   sound brilliant and last a long time - period.  Just my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.  -- *********************************************************************** **    Alan Webber                                                    ** **                      webb@itu1.sun.ac.za                          ** **                      webb@itu2.sun.ac.za                          ** **                                                                   ** ** The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high  ** ** The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by          ** ** Apprehension creeping like a choo-train up your spine             ** ** Will the tightrope reach the end; will the final couplet rhyme    ** ***********************************************************************

The transformer is just that - a  transformer.  It's there primarily to step the voltage up or down.  (Although the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOT negligible, as anyone who's zapped said transistor from either failing to get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a "snubber" diode across it would tell you.  Actually, many transistors intended for switcher use today have the diode built in.)  The basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this (in a somewhat simplified manner):  The AC line is rectified to produce a high voltage, more-or-less unregulated DC rail.  The energy storage (or "filter") caps appear across this rail, as does the switching transistor. The transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer, resulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary, which  are then rectified and filtered.  At least one of the transformer's outputs is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor, which acts in a "pulse-width modulation" (PWM) fashion to control (by varying the pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary, and therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary.  The remaining outputs may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will, more-or-less tracking the regulated output, or they may have some additional linear regulation added.  You may also note that the feedback between the  regulated output and the PWM control (which is most typically an IC) is not done via a direct electrical connection; this is due to various safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be electrically isolated.  Often, the feedback path involves an optoisolator to meet this requirement.  While the transformer isn't the primary energy-storage device in these designs, this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can be ignored; besides the inductive "kick" giving the switch transistor a bad time (as noted above), you also need to worry about getting all the energy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again, one way or another. In some designs, this happens more or less automatically - but in others, you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn't saturate, which again would have disastrous results (best left to the  imagination! :-)).  I'm NOT by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer;  hopefully, a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors in the above.

Which Sony do you have??  I have a 27"SXR (pre-XBR series, circa 1987).  That damn thing used to make noise like a mad-man.  I had/have 2 separate problems...one being the flyback, the other was the assembly where the windings of the yoke came together.   the thing would make noise.  I guess that there was enough of a potential in that assembly to leak, so I sprayed it with a dielectric insulation spray--I think it was urethane or acyrilic.  That fixed it.  leave the cover off, the TV will be quiet.  If I put the cover back on, and let it heat up, it'll start to whine--kinda hard to solve with the cover on!! :-(  A friend of mine who used to fix TV's says there might be a pin-hole leak somewhere on the flyback.  Usually it's surrounded by a bunch of black dust/dirt.  I hope this is a start...if you find something out, let me know!  aaron

I would think that would be great _fun_, not having ever felt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze. This is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear of getting punished for something I never was sure of. The Bible is hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did not answer. In the end, I found I had been following a mass delusion, a lie. I can't believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint of her existence.  > Obviously there are many Christians who have tried and do believe. So .. ?  I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe and analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the opposite - one should not examine one's belief critically.  I'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this group two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over, I decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional responses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only a couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works, thank god, just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admit that I had lied, and fallen prey to the same illusion.  > No one asks you to swallow everything, in fact Jesus warns against it.   But let > me ask you a question.

I used to believe what I read in books when I was younger, or what other people told me, but I grew more and more skeptical the more I read. I learned what it means to use _reason_.  As a student of chemistry, I had to perform a qualitative analysis of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experiments like this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student's workload considerably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first attempt. However, I think I'll never forget the lesson:   No matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X, it may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take a leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent.  But it can still be wrong.   I found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism to believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear,  filtering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god playing any part.   > The life , death, and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact.  Oh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better documented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented quite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too much attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance, the end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.  Jesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.  > As much > as anything else you learn.  How do you choose what to believe and  > what not to?  This is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind, and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I observe. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the evidence.   It makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not. I assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.  > There is no way to get into a sceptical heart.

Those who do are usually remembered as heroes, at least among those who believe. Dan, do you think I'm lying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is  very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not do so anymore. But I can't go on lying to myself.  Blind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind. But if god really wants me, she'll know what to do. I'm willing. I just don't know whether she exists - looking at the available evidence, it looks like she doesn't.

At nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereas fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot water.  As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive contamination.  Wayne Martin

I believe that the idea of objective morality is absurd, becasuse all the evidence I've seen indicates that morality and moral systems are man made and thus subjective.  This is not a shot at Christianity; I would apply it to any other person or group that advocates objective morality, unless said person/group can provide some sort of evidence to support that claim.

       Hey,     I am looking for C-algorithm, which decide,whether a 3D-Point is    inside a space which was defined by 8 x 3D-points.

No, gravity is an inherent system.  You don't need any excess information other than observations to determine anything.  It is possible to objectively determine someone's guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system. I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that everything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean that it cannot be objective in theory.  >This "natural morality" is not an objective system, as evidenced by >your comments about lions, and mine.  Perhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before, the practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likely the only ones to be considered "immoral" under the previous "definitions" of the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since the class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.  >>And in fact, the only way that the postulates could be determined by an >>outsider would be if there were some sort of higher truth, like some >>sort of god or something.

A creationist appears on t.o, makes a completely unsupported statement the facts of which he/she is completely ignorant, is taken to task, and finally replies with a subtle insult. (actually two insults)  Just to make sure I am being fair let's check a few details. Jack, you don't know anything about abiogenesis, do you? (this is no sin, I know next to nothing about it either) I mean, anything other than this "10^50"  probability thing which you got wrong in the first post.  The speculation involved is really your own, isn't it? How much _biology_ do you know, even apart from abiogenesis? Any classes past high school? Read Chris Colby's FAQ? How much paleontology, geology, etc do you know? Or are you speculating that its all speculative? Do you have any basis upon which to imply that to keep an "open mind" one must allow that the earth, universe, and all the creatures in it could have been created ~10,000 years ago? None of this is intended as a flame. To say that you don't know a subject is _not_ the same as calling you an idiot. I don't know _much_ about these areas, but then I am not the one calling into question all of mainstream science. In other words, where do you get off calling it speculative unless by this you also mean that all of physics, chemistry, etc are also speculative in some sense?  You may have, in fact, not been implying that the rejection of creationism is a sign of close-mindedness, or that the theory of evolution is especially speculative, in which case I have merely misinterpreted you. In this case the worst thing you could be accused of is unclear prose.  >Jack  Scott smullins@ecn.purdue.edu

Actually, it is simple.  A person P has committed a crime C in country X if P was within the borders of X at the time when C was committed.  It doesn't matter if the physical manifestation of C is outside X.  For instance, if I hack into NASA's Ames Research Lab and delete all their files, I have committed a crime in the United Kingdom.  If the US authorities wish to prosecute me under US law rather than UK law, they have no automatic right to do so.  This is why the net authorities in the US tried to put pressure on some sites in Holland.  Holland had no anti-cracking legislation, and so it was viewed as a "hacker haven" by some US system administrators.  Similarly, a company called Red Hot Television is broadcasting pornographic material which can be received in Britain.  If they were broadcasting in Britain, they would be committing a crime.  But they are not, they are broadcasting from Denmark, so the British Government is powerless to do anything about it, in spite of the apparent law-breaking.  Of course, I'm not a lawyer, so I could be wrong.  More confusingly, I could be right in some countries but not in others...   mathew

 A few months ago, in one the the motorcycle mags, there was an article that mentioned reflector tape that was supposed to be available thru BMW.  The idea was that the tape would look black in sunlight, and reflect in other colors at night to headlights.  It sounded like a nice way to add nighttime  visibility without turning the bike into a carnival attraction.  I talked to the local BMW dealer about this.  I was told that the  only thing he had heard about this kind of reflector, was it being  used in a coming line of BMW clothing (rainsuits).  He wasn't aware  of anything regarding self applied tape.  Has anyone come across this from BMW or any other source?  Thanks,  --- Steve Bunis,  Sun Microsystems     ***DoD #0795***	93-ST1100               Itasca, IL	  ***AMA #682049***	78-KZ650

After telling everyone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago, signing the liability waiver, and getting his pre-flight, off he went...  Well, not quite.  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street, feeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and got the persistent wanker off my ass for good), heard the horrendous racket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash.

Jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage.  Matty was quick. While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed to snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature.  Twenty minutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the bike.  I'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortly afterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that Matty told me he ran the charge through in December and that it went uncontested.   --  Stephen Manes					   manes@magpie.linknet.com Manes and Associates				   New York, NY, USA  =o&>o  
 I had a GE Emerson 13" color TV for about 3 years and one fine day, while we were watching something (I doubt if the program was the cause), we heard a mild explosion.   Our screen went blank but there was sound, so we thought, 'oh we have special effects on the program'.  But soon the sound stopped and smoke started to appear at the back of the TV. The brilliant EEs we are, we unplugged the TV and called customer service only to be thrown around by please hold, I will transfer u to blah blah..   Finally we abandoned the idea of trying to fix the TV and got a new one (we wanted a bigger one too!).  After all the story, what I wanted to know is: Is my problem an isolated incident or a common one? (I recall reading about Russian TVs exploding, but not here, in the US). Why would the picture tube explode or even smoke?  I still have the left over TV set, I might dig into it this summer. Any idea where I can get parts for these things?

At the cost of repudiating the FAQ, I think too much is made of the strong vs weak atheism issue, although in the context of alt.atheism, where we're continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists "believe" in the non-existence of god, I think the separation is a valid one.  To cover my arse, what I'm trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (I wish!).  Whereas I _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position, in effect I am a strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty.  If I read the FAQ correctly, no argument for the existence of god (generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been found to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the _real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.  I'm a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome (but perhaps we should change the thread subject). --  Lucio de Re (lucio@proxima.Alt.ZA) - tab stops at four.

Article-I.D.: travis.1pscti$aqe  Some rendering programs require that all surface normals point in the same direction.  (ie: On a closed cube, all normals point outwards).  You can use the points on the faces to determine the direction of the normal, by making sure that all points are either in clockwise or counter-clockwise order.  How do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction, given a  set of points, edges and faces?   Say that you had a cube with all faces that  have their normals facing outwards, except for one face.  What's the best way to realize that face is "flipped", and should have it's points re-ordered?   I thought I had a good way of telling this, but then realized that the algorithm I had would only tell you if you had points in clockwise order for a 2d polygon.  I'd like something for 3d data.

No.  That's *not* what I was complaining about, nor did I intend to suggest that DEC was any better than SGI (let me tell you about the Lynx some day, but be prepared with a large sedative if you do...).  My comment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendors that supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI.  What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.  I'm also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around for a while, rather than being flushed.  Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter), but I'm just a little tired of getting boned in the process.  Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we aren't entitled to a "peek under the covers" as the Big Kids (NASA, for instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations, doesn't have a load of money to spend on computers every year, so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis. The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond.  That means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I have the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase one previous poster's words, 'to fill a niche' to compete with some other vendor.  I'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years. And every time I look at it, I'm going to think about SGI and how I could have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we're supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars).

Typical (in the old 2x-oversampling units) was a thirteen-tap FIR, implemented as a dedicated hardware addition circuit.

In order to get the data via ftp do the following:  	1) ftp taurus.cs.nps.navy.mil 	2) login as anonymous, guest as the password 	3) cd pub/dabro 	4) binary 	5) get cyber.tar.Z  Once you get the data onto your workstation:  	1) uncompress data.tar.Z 	2) tar xvof data.tar  If you have any questions, please let me know.  george dabro dabro@taurus.cs.nps.navy.mil --  george dabrowski Cyberware Labs  dabro@taurus.cs.nps.navy.mil

Sorry, been reading too much on the CLIPPER project lately, >>and the paranoia over there may have seeped in some. > >;)  What is the CLIPPER project BTW?  The CLIPPER initiative is an announcement by Clinton that all the  "secure" voice phones will use the same crypto chip, as a de-facto government standard.  Problem is, the government is admitting that they hold the keys to break the code easily, and the Justice department will be using the keys to listen in on "illegal activities."  Many people are really scared about such an initiative because it is a major step towards outlawing real crypto protection on things like email if you read the press release.  The project was developed by NSA and given to NIST.  It uses two keys S1 and S2 that the government claims are needed to break the code.  They claim that these keys will be handed to two different companies, and when they get a warrant to do a wiretap (the chip is nicknamed the wiretap chip), they have to get the keys from both companies.  People have poked holes through and through the press release official version and shown how it is nowhere near as nice as it sounds, and I have given the simplified version.  People over on sci.crypt are really scared about this proposal it seems. --  *************************************************************************** * mccullou@whipple.cs.wisc.edu * Never program and drink beer at the same * * M^2                          *  time.
