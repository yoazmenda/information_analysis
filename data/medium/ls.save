notwithstanding.  First of all, I have no phobia of objective reality.  I'm simply saying that the scientific model of the atom is probably not what is really 
out there.  I'm not saying that there's no object that sources these properties we measure from atomic theory.  Take light as another example.  There are two 
theories: particle and wave.  Each one fails to predict the behavior of light as some point. So which is it: particle or wave?  You tell me.  You're the 
sensible one.  -- jim halat halat@bear.com bear-stearns --whatever doesn't kill you will only serve to annoy you-- nyc i speak only for myself

you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something is written in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plus the lack of 
external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if you do quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with supporting evidence.

though, even the Sheiks at Al-Azhar don't claim that the Shi'ites are heretics. Most of the accusations and fabrications about Shi'ites come out of Saudi Arabia 
from the Wahabis. For that matter you should read the original works of the Sunni Imams (Imams of the four madhabs). The teacher of at least two of them was 
Imam Jafar Sadiq (the sixth Imam of the Shi'ites).  Although there is plenty of false propaganda floating around about the Shi'ites (esp. since the revolution), 
there are also many good works by Shi'ites which present the views and teachings of their school. Why make assumptions and allegations (like people in this 
group have done about Islam in general) about Shi'ites.

However, who is at blame is another question. It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions-- realizing the risks--is to blame.

Okay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not all such "murders" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life is 
wrong, no matter what the circumstances?  >If we, as a society, decide to murder someone, then we should say >that, and lists our reasons for doing so, and live 
with the moral >consequences.  We should not play word games and pretend that >murder isn't murder.  And that's *my* opinion about how society >ought to be run.  
But, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of society shares this 
blame.  And, most people's definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an execution, is it?  >>But, we were trying to 
discuss an objective moral system, or at least its >>possibilty.  What ramifications does your personal system have on an >>objective one? >No, we were not 
discussing an objective moral system.  I was showing >you that you didn't have one, because, for one thing, you were incapable >of defining the terms in it, for 
example, "murder".  Murder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing it at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter 
who the innocent victim is.  >>We're not talking about reading minds, we are just talking about knowing the >>truth.  Yes, we can never be absolutely certain

the absolute truth matters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That is, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.  >Moreover, a 
jury which comes from a sufficiently prejudiced background >may allow itself to be persuaded beyond a serious doubt on evidence >that you and I would laugh at.  
But then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the conviction was unfair.  >>But, would it be perfectly fair if we could read minds?  If we

able to distinguish capital punishnment from murder.  Yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all possible information), we can't 
always determine the difference in our flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible, but it still isn't objectively perfect.  You see, 
it doesn't matter if we *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.  >Now there's a huge difference.  If we can read minds, we can
