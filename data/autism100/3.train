' <div class=\"postbody\">It\' is going very bad with the K teacher since day 1, my child comes crying everyday because of the difference in the treatment. He is aware that teacher prefers certain kids to others. We are immigrants and the teacher is a little bit not very tolerant, she prefers blond blue eyes kids. He thinks its the norm because of the previous pre-k bad experience. I know that teachers will not go against each other for a child. Please note that the child is extremely bright academically and way above K level. I don\'t want my child to have a low self esteem and feel inferior. Last week a parent pulled their daughter from the class but went to another school (also immigrants).  What solutions do I have? He doesn\'t want to be homeschooled. He loves people.  Thank you for your help</div>'

I am not sure if my daughter has autism or not but either way, she does have a \"stim.\"      I always thought her finger wiggling was a habbit.  I never thought much of it, although I always found it to be odd looking.  I just assumed she would outgrow it.  She is four now.      My question is, will it ever go away?  I am new to the idea she may have autism and to be honest I am feeling a bit overwhelmed.  Before I realized what she was doing was not a habbit, I tried to get her to stop.  She was able to stop at that moment without any problems however just a few hours later, she would be doing it again.      Does anyone have advise on what I can do for her?  Do your children stim?  Do they drift off at a certain age?  Do I just need to let her do it?     I am so confused and sad I was pushing her to stop when she couldnt control herself.  Any advise would really help me out.</div>'

At home, he has to go to his room for time-out for about 4-5 minutes when he does something he knows he shouldn\'t (ex. sit on the cat).      A lot of times, I can ask him \"do you want to go to time-out?\" when I see him about to do something he shouldn\'t.  Most of the time he\'ll reply \"no\" and stop doing it.  Key word being MOST!!

However, they are seperate disorders. Many children (most? all? I\'m not really sure about this) with autism have SPD but not all people with SPD are autistic. SPD can often be seen alongside other developmental disorders and it can also exist on it\'s own with no other issues.  Dana has posted some fantastic sensory resources and links. Check in the reference section. Also, if this is an avenue you are exploring, I would highly recommend, <strong>The Out-of-Sync Child: Recognizing and Coping with Sensory Integration Dysfunction</strong>, by Carol Stock Kranowitz  I found it to be invaluable in helping me to recognize SPD in my son.

' <div class=\"postbody\">It\'s really nice to read that parents on the site have children who have had very positive Montessori experiences. I was in Montessori education full-time for years, and now work one-one with children with autism.     I have some thoughts to share that might help a lot of children, parents, and teachers.    While Montessori really lends itself to special needs and sensory issues, the teachers are like I was before I had exposure to the subject of autism and other conditions. It\'s great that a good teacher usually tunes into each child individually, and \"gets\" what a child is experiencing.     Montessori teachers ASSUME that no one child is going to be like another. Montessori teachers see it is their job to support the child by working well with parents, who are of course the first and will always be the most important teachers for any child. This is how they are trained. But they are usually not trained to work with children with special needs, per se, nor how to talk with parents about their observations when a child presents with behavior or learning differences. This is an aside...but Montessori is such a multi-sensory experience, that a child with auditory processing or other difficulties can often have his or her issues go unnoticed for longer because of the visual, non-verbal, and kinesthetic aspects of the whole experienced. (longer than would be the case in a traditional preschool.)    Parents who are involved with Montessori might consider making presentations at staff meetings as teachers are hungry for first-hand information from those they truly respect - the parents! Or, even if you\'re not involved with a school, most Montessori schools would welcome a parent with insights and first-hand experiences about ASD issues.    Right now there are a few children who have definite behavior and learning issues at the school I enjoy subbing at (between the 10 day AIT sessions that I hold). These children who could strongly benefit from OT and other interventions, though I am not surely not qualified to say how they would be assessed if evaluated. There are definitie sensory and communication challenges there also.    Neither parents nor teachers are usually informed about special needs issues and the potential that can come from early intervention. When teachers believe there are issues that need to be looked into, and understand the benefits of early diagnosis, they can be really \"up against it\" when they broach the subject with parents. Two out of three parents seem to remove a child from school rather than get an evaluation for a 2 or 3 year-old. Teachers and school admin may need some help from parents so staff can talk to parents in ways that can be heard.     Knowing now what I\'ve learned from parents, children, and other trainings, I\'d have both a way for parents to train teachers AND a parent support group within the school to offer help, support, and information to other parents.     If a child\'s doctor doesn\'t think there is an issue, which is so often the case, it\'s only natural that parents wait until they\'ve heard concerns from more than just 1 teacher or school. It can be such a hard bridge to cross to go from \"my child is doing fine\" to \"perhaps my child has special needs and requires some new opportunities\"...or \"my child has autism.\"    It would be so much more in the service of children if children could stay in this environment that serves them so well AND recieve the necessary interventions - and if parents could recieve more support around investigating these matters.    All this is not to say that sometimes Montessori doesn\'t offer the small groups and structure needed for kids on the spectrum. But many children can manage wonderfully once their sensory issues and other challenges are addressed adequately.    Jennifer</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Your son sounds much like mine.  A distressed birth.  The nerve not developing properly is also like mine--we have found out that it is likely due to a systemic mold infection. The thought is that antibiotics early in life wiped out the good flora in his gut, and a mold infection, we think from the home we lived in, got a good foothold.  He is deaf in one ear.    I would consider getting your doctor to prescribe nystatin, and take it for a month.  It is non-toxic and does not leave the bowel.  It will probably really help gut issues also; we take a probiotic between doses of nystatin daily.  My son is 12 and in managed recovery.  After doing all this for almost 10 years now, I look back and antifungals are the thing that helped him the most over the years, but we did not really understand this (or why!) at the time.  We would do a round (15 days) of nystatin or diflucan, he\'d do really great, and then we\'d begin the gradual backslide.  If antifungals work, you need to stay on them as you work to heal the gut.  Also if you get a really good response to antifungals, you might consider consulting a toxicologist or environmental medicine specialist instead of a DAN.  This is what I wish I\'d done; didn\'t know any better then, but I do now.  Good luck!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hey everyone,  I have been super duper busy and just when I got time to catch up on this forum...my computer was giving us trouble-ugh!!  I hope everyone is well and gosh, I feel like I have been away from my family although it has only been a short time!    My question is this....    My Audrey who is 2 1/2 yrs old is fascinated with books (and has been for about 2 months)...we only really give her picture books or simple sentence books, but she has been labeling everything since she started to talk a couple months ago.  Tonight when she was playing with her Baby Einstein and Baby Bumblebee flash cards, I decided to cover the picture separately and just have her \"read\" the words at the bottom.  She never knew which card I took because I took the whole pile and covered one , but she \"read\" - dog, cat, duck, elephant, banana, apple, flower, etc.  I then decided that maybe she had just memorized them because she really likes looking at the flash cards and the words.  I then got a new set of flash cards that she had never seen and tried them...she got several of the words that she would have seen before correct and she even said \"dog\" for frog and \"duck\" for truck.  Does this mean she is hyperlexic?? Could she just be memorizing the words with the pics or is that the same thing?    I have only heard about this but never imagined she was doing that - but did notice how intently she stares at her books and especially the words on them.  Does anyone know more about this?    Thanks for any info....and does this mean we should be doing different things in her aba or natural setting teaching---should we encourage this and help or not?      Thanks guys!!  Kim</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I live in Toronto, and my son attends The Toronto Montessori for Autism. Thank goodness for this school, it has enpowered my child and the approach is amazing. It incorporates the Montessori approach with ABA..the program is structured for my son. My son get 2:1 approach (can\'t afford 1:1)...this will be his second year in the program and this year he will be intergrated with NT children on Montessori field trips and outdoor play. My son attended public school for 7 months, 7 months I wasted on giving my son what he deserves. I fought daily with that school, they were a bunch of ignorant people that left my son in the corner, the only thing he learned was how to use the photocopier. 2 months in the Montessori school my son can name every country in Europe and South America..I can\'t do that, he learns piano as part of his class, daily chores and respondsibilities...I could go on and on. BTW the Director of the School is soooooooooooooo educated and passionate about the abilities and potential of our kids. Do a search on The Toronto Montessori School for Autism. You can even purchase her manual to use or give to your Montessori school to use as a guide for educating a child with autism in the Montessori way....Amazing, warning though this manual is extremely detailed.

' <div class=\"postbody\">For us the inability to show empathy was a big red flag - particularly in our daughter(dx PDD-NOS).  She is very verbal and very social - but whenever a situation came where she needed to respond in an empathetic manner - she always gave an inappropriate response.  She would laugh when she was in trouble (and at the time we thought she was just a \"spirited\" kid), she would laugh if someone was crying/hurt.  I distinctly remember her laughing hysterically when I had morning sickness during my pregnancy with my youngest child.  Now after a TON of social stories later she is starting to get it - sometimes she overreacts Mason (dx: ASD), just doesn\'t respond much at all to those situations.  Sometimes we may get an \"are you ok?\", or if I fake it heavily during play (like start fake crying) he will cry too but those instances are few and far between.

My sweet son has already been through so much in his short 2 1/2 years that it has been really hard for me to accept that this is now another huge hurdle for him.  With that said, my husband and I are ready to roll up our sleeves and get to work to help him the very best we can!  Here are just a few of the hundreds of questions I have swirling around my head:  1.Any tips on how to balance your time for research?  I have read this forum, online and so many books lately that it is making my head hurt--literally!  I need some advice on how to balance this with all of our other efforts.  I don\'t want to be obsessed with reading about everything at the expense of spending time with my children.  Recently I have been waiting until everyone is in bed, but I can\'t keep doing this because I am so exhausted from staying up so late trying to figure out all the biomed/diet stuff, therapy ideas, etc.  2.Any ideas that have worked for you on streamlining all the paperwork---tracking behaviors/concerns, etc.  I feel like I need to document his every move---behavior specialist wants data, I want to see how different foods affect him, dr. wants all the poop details, the list goes on and on!  I am need of some serious forms/charts, something!  3.I know this is a particularly hard one, but any advice would be appreciated.  How have you balanced things with your other children?  As you all know very well, most days it feels like this child with special needs is a full time job, if not him, all the coordination, paperwork, etc.  While it is my tendency to want to give him everything I\'ve got---I have other children that I love just as dearly.

He\'s really cool.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <img src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h44/sashasrecovery/AutismRibon.gif\" alt=\"Image\" /></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thanks guys, I\'m getting excited now! lol      Good points about the peak hours and younger kids, mmesmama and sashasmom.  Whichever gym we choose, the caregivers will have to give him more attention, especially at first, as if he\'s going to display any \"undesirable\" or aggressive behaviors, it\'s usually out of excitement when meeting <strong>new </strong>kids in a <strong>busy </strong>environment.  But if the caregivers are willing to work with us for the first couple of weeks, and we avoid peak hours, I think it could work.  Keeping my fingers crossed!</div>'

Once they get to the front of the line, let them get a prize (maybe a \'swim\' in the sink or a tub of water, or a \"treat\") Move it to a piece of tape on the floor, eventually, and have him practice lining up stuffed animals or something similar, and have him get in line, once each one of his \'friends\' gets through, allow him a treat. I think that would help with understanding getting through a line/waiting... You could have his \'friends\' get out of line, and not allow them back in, and deny them treats...this might help with understanding getting out of the line...

' <div class=\"postbody\">i can only speak for my son\'s martial arts class, but the whole basis of the class in respect for self, self discipline, and above all else respect for others.  Bullying is dealt with swiftly and harshly, they have a zero tolerance.  One kid lost his belt for bullying, another was not allowed to test the because of fighting at school, it\'s uncommon, but I\'ve seen kids running laps for being rude to an instructor or a class mate.  The reason it is uncommon is because it doesn\'t happen very often.  I would most definitely bring it to the attention of an instructor.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I agree with getting yourself healthy before you get pregnant and eat fresh organic food while pregnant and lots of green veggies.  Take probiotics too.    My son was vaccinated fully and received thimerisol in his shots.  He had such bad reactions after each round of shots that I was told were \"normal.\"  I would never give him another shot in his life.  He simply cannot handle it.  I do give him a wholesome diet with lots of green veggies and other supplements to keep him immune system healthy in case he does get sick.  My son was the healthiest kid in his class this year according to his teacher.  He rarely got sick, and if he did, it was very mild and he was over it in a few days.    With my daughter, I spaced out her shots for the first 12 months and she did not have any reaction to them until the chicken pox vaccine.  She started to get a little spacy for a few days and I stopped the shots altogether.  Both my kids had problems with the live virus vaccinations.  My daughter has an awesome diet and eats lots of veggies and drinks a green drink everyday.      If you do choose to vaccinate, space them out, don\'t vaccinate within a month of an illness, and don\'t give more than 1 or 2 at a time.  Monitor all reactions and see how your child reacts to them.  I wish this information had been available to me 7 years ago.  The information out there now is incredible and you can really make an informed choice.    Hope that helps.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Yes!  We\'ve seen this a lot.  My three year old has a few different patches that will turn very blond when he is regressing and darken when he\'s moving forward.  His hair also gets very oily when he\'s moving forward and very dry when he\'s regressing.  This also goes along with his skin getting dry or normal.  I just assumed it was him--interesting that others are seeing this.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Ok. Before anyone says stop worrying and enjoy your son, I couldn\'t  possibly have more fun with him than I do.  He is the highlight of everyday and I can\'t wait to get home from work to see him.  We have so much fun together, and I do mean together.  He\'s a social kid.    Unfortunately, there are still so many questions.  It\'s still so frustrating that every professional he has contact with: Developmental Pediatrician, 4 Pediatricians, 2 Speech Therapists, Early Intervention, Occupational Therapist all say there\' s nothing wrong besides a delay.  Of course this won\'t be frustrating if they turn out to be correct.    My boy is 18 months old and has made great strides in his motor development.  He was 5 weeks early and was behind in gross motor, but is catching up quick in that area.  He seems to understand a lot of what we say.  If I ask him to go get me the phone or his shoes, he\'ll run in the other room and come back with them.  He will answer questions by shaking his head no and he\'s started saying \"yes\".  He also will pretend to talk on the phone and sometimes will try and feed his bear.  He\'s a pointing machine and he will sometimes point to things of interest and see if we are looking.  These are good things right?     So what am I concerned with?    His expressive language, eye contact, lack of empathy,  He has maybe 6 words and I\'m not even sure they are words.  He doesn\'t seem to initiate any words.  He will answer what does a cow say, or do you want this, but doesn\'t just try to say things to us.  Maybe just labeliing once in awhile.  Is this ok?  He still won\'t look anyone in the eye when they are holding him.  He does have good eye contact when it\'s from a little further away.  He has no attachement to objects or toys.  Isn\'t he supposed to at this point.  He has no toy preferences.  He will play with cars appropriately though.  He\'s not interested in wheels or anything.  Should he have empathy at this point?    What other behaviors should I be looking for at this age?  I\'ve read all of the first signs, red flags, blah, blah, but from your personal experience- what really matters at this age?    What would be YOUR red flags at 18 months?    Thanks in advance.    John</div>'

She mentioned that there is a DTaP combo that is mercury free now.     She also mentioned to follow the vaccine schedule in her book \"What you doctor may not tell you about children\'s vaccinations\". She recommends to seperate the MMR vaccine into 3 shots giving the measels first, then the rubella, then the mumps.     She commented that if she had a child with Autism (vaccine related or not) that she would NOT vaccinate a sibling to the ASD child.

' <div class=\"postbody\">At 2.5 my son had a few words that he wasn\'t using consistently. At that time he had been diagnosed with \"speech delay, no autistic features\" (yeah, right) and was getting some ST through EI. Not helpful at all.  Regressed massively at 2.7, lost all words and many other skills (we were afraid he had CDD so ironically the diagnosis of ASD was a tiny relief), diagnosed as autistic (\"pretty severe\" according to neurologist). Started ABA/VB around 2.8 and it helped him learn to talk again. Aquiring new words doesn\'t seem to be a problem for my son because he has great memory, using language in conversational/social context is. We were also having a whopping 1 hour /week ST through EI which was absolutely useless and I ended up cancelling many sessions because they were such a waste of time. To this date my son never had a good SLP working with him. It was his VB therapist who also addressed articulation issues, apraxia etc. I will be looking again into speech this year because of prosody issues.  Alex\'s mom  P.S. I also credit removing milk from his diet very early on for a chunk of his improvement, because we saw notable changes right away before our program really got going.

Not that ABA is wrong - but why should cost be mentioned when ABA obviously costs more?

Did you seek an autistic child, or did one fall in your lap.  I would love to hear more about how you came to have him.  --Kristal</div>    In the process of adopting.  D is our foster son, who\'s been with us just about two years now.  He basically \"fell into our laps\" lol, we were approached and asked if we would foster him, based on our backgrounds in working with children/people with special needs.  Hubby worked specifically with autistic children for 7 years, and was known around town as \"the autism guy\"  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /> After D started to thrive in our home, he was put up for adoption, and after some long heartfelt talks, hubby and I decided to adopt him - we just couldn\'t allow for him to be moved again.  This kid has been let down by everyone in his life, and we refuse to let him down.    Geez I love my kid.    The hard parts though are a)not knowing his background very well, such as when he first had symptoms, what he was exposed to, what interventions were done, what he was like as a wee one, etc., and b)knowing that if he\'d been with us, and had good intervention earlier, he\'d be a lot better off.  We didn\'t get him until he was 6 1/2 - that\'s over SIX YEARS of lost time.  I truly believe that if D had been put in a good, supportive, SAFE home from infancy that he\'d be \"normal\" today.    Thanks rlneub for the bit of hope that my \"older child\" may still be able to heal, and thank you jrsmom for sharing about your child  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /></div>'

The only way to really know how many hours will benefit Luke is to just let them get in there and do it. If you feel like she\'s good than really, really you have to believe that a little quality will definitely outweigh a lot of quantity when it comes to teaching your son. I know how it is to go back and forth but I would definitley try to go with your gut on this one and try and find a way to put your husband\'s concerns to rest.

' <div class=\"postbody\">It didn\'t go as well as I had hoped.  They played games FOREVER.  And the funny thing is the people kept saying &quot;Here Kyle I won but you can have my candy&quot;.  I tried to tell them it wouldn\'t matter if you won a car, he just wants to WIN!!  After awhile he was walking in all the rooms people weren\'t in and finally asked if we could leave.    At the party they had chocolate cake.  He doesn\'t like that so I had said we could go get some donuts because he didn\'t like chocolate.  We get there and I say, now if they don\'t have the kind you like, we can\'t get that upset blah blah blah.  The girl has half the donuts in the box when he figures out they don\'t have the donuts he likes.  He had a huge fit.  At that point I just said give me the donuts and left. He shouldn\'t have gotten them, but I just wanted to get out of there and at that point he is not going to learn he won\'t get the donuts next time if he does it again.  I\'ve done that a thousand times and it doesn\'t work.  I went home and cried.  Oh well.  There\'s always tomorrow.

' <div class=\"postbody\">In my area where i live, we have nothing in terms of parent support groups. I travel 30 miles once a week to attend another group but dont know of any group closer to home.     I am looking for ideas from all of you experienced parents out there in terms of what is a good \"name\" to call my group, and what you as parents would like to see done in an \"ideal\" support group for parents of kids with autism.     We hope to get off the ground next month. I have a venue booked and about 10 people so far who will attend. Turns out we might even be able to get some funding for it if we find someone with the expertise in fund writing.     all ideas welcomed and urgently needed.  I am wracking my brain trying to come up with a catchy \"acronym\", like Action Against Autism the AAA, or something like that.     thanks people</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Ok, I am not a doctor. My brother Jim is. But I work with him in developing the computer programs behind his protocol.     In our practice, we find that 20% of our patients need TMG and the rest it has a damping effect (lessens the effect of MB12). There are posts on this board in which Tami removed TMG and the things that happend were amazing.    Would you be willing for a 2 week trial to remove TMG and see if you get a more positive effect? You can always addit back if response drops off.    Have you notice pink, red or orange urine? If so, make the injection even shallower.    Lastly the parent designed report form on our website, <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.drneubrander.com\">www.drneubrander.com</a><!-- w -->, is designed to find the little things that show response to MB12. We have many patientes who do not get a big response in language so without the form they think nothing is happening until they fill out the parent designed report form and see all the little stuff happening. That is how you know MB12 is needed. Also, we find that when needed and even if not a lot of the Language part, that geat strides happen as more and more of the brain recovers.    Now, 6% of our patients do not respond to MB12. The parent designed report form has hardly any responses. These are the ones that truly do not need to be on the shots.</div>'

It seems some professionals view kids with autism just like any other object or possession that clutters their life. They are laughing at the things that make them autistic, not at what makes them beautiful and alive. I think what MCA describes is the latter and is a child\'s amazing ability to remind you just what is important in life. It\'s almost a feeling you get, and that feeling makes you laugh. As opposed to laughing first, if that makes any sense.    I think there is a culture amongst professionals as to \"these are the things we laugh at\" about kids with autism. To me, it\'s sad that they can\'t build a sincere relationship and find a unique reason to enjoy the children they are <em>lucky</em> to be around. They are missing out.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ -ni armes ni violence et sans haine-</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ -ni armes ni violence et sans haine-</div>'
