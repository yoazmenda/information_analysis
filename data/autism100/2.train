'jonsdfca -What size class did your son have in preschool? If his preschool IEP requires a smaller class size, they have to explain (in writing if you request) why they have upped his class size. In term of benefit to him, not in terms of whether or not they have an appropriate class in the school. They must FIND an appropriate class if putting him in the kindergarten with the all the kids is not \"reasonably calculated\" to enable him to make \"more than trivial progress.\" This is what the law says. If you believe he will not progress at all in his proposed placement, you can go to Due Process and make a case that the District is setting him up to fail. Read your Due Process Rights - the school MUST give every parent at copy at least once a year.'

I haven\'t really settled down much mostly because I need the fresh start over and over.

One of the bands I played with (of which my brother was also a member as a drummer) did do fairly well locally, playing gigs on and off for about 2 years. We broke up when our frontman decided to go solo, essentially ditching us in the process. <br /> <br />I do get taken advantage of and misunderstood a lot on the job, and that\'s one reason why I have never kept any one job more than about 2 years. This school-teaching experience that I\'m dealing with right now has been absolutely horrendous for me from all aspects, and I have been in almost continuous overload for the past 3 months. My separate lives in my hometown (where my family lives), and my college town (where I have some close friends), serve as escapes for me on weekends and scheduled breaks. I will leave teaching behind in less than a week, and focus solely on my other 2 \"lives.\" I will seek to find employment and stability in one place, while using the other as an escape and a crutch. I\'m not yet sure which town will fill which role, though. After I\'ve had a few weeks to recover emotionally, I will proceed to figure that one out.<span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by stickboy26 on May 25 2007 at 9:21am</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>-   ~Nick   Still in touch with my inner child ;)</div>'

'Niki, <br />My son is in Kindergarten and he will turn 6 on Sunday. He is not the <br />oldest one in that class by the way. He is only in a half day Kindergarten <br />and believe me he has been in an intense ABA program for some time. <br />He still is getting used to the demands that are placed upon him at <br />school. He has to process everyting so much faster. Its pretty fast paced. <br />I have noticed a lot more inattentiveness and zoning out. We are <br />tweaking his home program a bit to get him used to the pace of school <br />and all the distractions that it entails. Without the supports that my son <br />gets, I think he too would be a mess.

He will attend the regular classroom for circle time, recess, and specials (art, music, gym, etc) and this class will be his \"homeroom\". He will spend the rest of the time in the autism classroom. Our school district does not use ABA in the classroom. Instead, the autism classroom uses a system based on the TEACCH method. While we love the ABA work we have done at home, and we know that our son has made great progress because of ABA, he does seem to have developed some issues of prompt dependence as a result. After meeting with the teacher and staff, we are excited about the methods used in this classroom, since they will work on helping him learn more self-initiative and independence.

She thought he was just missing rest time. When I pointed this out, she talked to the teacher and we came up with a different solution, which I hope works. I don\'t want him missing academics and his teacher totally agreed. My goal is to keep him in the mainstream classroom for as long as he can handle. I want the resource room to be a safe place he can go if he needs a short break, but I want him to graduate with a diploma if possible! </P> <P>I know I\'m sounding anal - especially since ds is in kindergarten. But, I don\'t want to start out with him being pulled out more than necessary. The ASD teacher agreed and is in full support of him staying in the classroom for almost all of the day. He needs a couple of short breaks and needs to finish his lunch during the class\' rest time - that is it for now. We will adjust as academics get harder and the pressures increase.

'I would request an IEE. What other tests were administered? Any tests for Autism or aspergers? What did the behavior rating scales look like?'
'Schools are not just responsible for academic progress but also for behavioral and FUNCTIONAL progress. If your child has organizational skills issues or social skills issues, he needs an IEP for that. Get the school to give him academic testing EVERY year. If he is not behind now, he will be by 4th grade (when kids are asked to work completely independently) if he doesn\'t get help NOW. Go back to that Advocate and get further advice. Or get a better Advocate.'

During school, they have informed us that his awareness of peers is sufficient for him to learn his ABC\'s (or whatever), which is their main responsibilty.

'<P>Gilda - </P> <P>You might want to make your situation a topic of its own, so it gets the attention it deserves.</P> <P>Micki -</P> <P>My answer below is a little rambling, sorry, but here are my thoughts about structure.</P> <P>I recently had a meeting with the school, and the new vice principal seemed shocked that my oldest son didn\'t have a visual schedule. She wanted to see that happen, and I wasn\'t exactly going to say stop, since the meeting was about the school planning and preparing for his day better. Too much time was being wasted on cozy activities or just plain drawing because there was no sub for his assistant/spec. ed teacher and no plan for him independently using the computer. In order to have a daily plan for HIM to see, they have to do the planning work for THEMSELVES.</P> <P>Anyhow, the first attempt at a visual schedule in 1st or 2nd grade was a failure. It just overwhelmed him to think too far ahead. We\'ll see how it goes now, but for him, it seems like routines work best. He says he hates special days because of the kids shouting hurrah (!) but then again he enjoyed the Christmas assembly more than getting candy at school that day. I see he can tolerate a greater sensory load than he used to, and I think that affects his need for structure and predictability. He can approach these situations with more confidence than fear.</P> <P>He\'s pretty flexible in terms of working with different people (like subs). But doing different kinds of worksheets is tougher. He gets easily overwhelmed by new worksheet tasks, especially if they have a mix of demands. So one kind of structure that\'s really important for him is focusing on one learning goal at a time. In math, we focus on math concepts and not his handwriting, for example.</P> <P>Structure that provides built-in cues is also good because it helps him stay on track with a task. I can\'t really think of any examples right now, but gtto\'s how to boil water video came to mind. And tape on the rug to mark where the child sits (and stays seated) in circle time, things like that. </P> <P>We don\'t have a lot of structure at home, and he does absolutely fine with that.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Norway Mom (mother of 2 sons who were born in 1998 and 2001.

'<P>If this is the annual review meeting, it will start with Present Levels of Performance. What infomation do you already have about his behavior? Is that enough to gauge his current level of behavior? If not, a FBA may be necessary to understand fully his present level of performance. The purpose of an FBA, as you may already know, is to find the FUNCTION of the behavior. The function is vital to know in order to come up with an appropriate behavior plan. When you get the FBA - before or after the meeting - depends on what you want to do with the info. I wouldn\'t postpone the meeting to do the FBA. I\'d have the meeting and table it if it becomes clear that the FBA information is vital in order to write the IEP for next year. You can always agree to whatever CAN be decided and then meet again once the FBA and resulting BIP are prepared. If knowing the function of the behavior is central to deciding placement for next year, then it might be important to get that done first.</P>'

'<P>Karbie - I was the president of our school district\'s SPec. Ed. PTO for 6 years. We have about 2,000 kids in our district who are classified into the spec. ed. system. Any given month, I\'d have 6 to 8 parents attend the meeting. It was VERY discouraging, especially since they were the parents who were the MOST knowlegable and needed the help the least. What I HAVE noticed, though, is the parent of autistic kids seem FAR more involved than the parents of kids with other disabilities. That may be because autism has, until recently, been enough of an unknown disorder that even the teachers were sorely uninformed, so the parents HAD to get involved heavily. It may be possible that the two autistic children you are getting will have similarly involved parents. I hope so.</P> <P>If you know a little about these students (age, functioning level, verbal level, etc.), perhaps some of us can post resources we have that might help you a bit. Of course, this is an excellent site - better than any other autism site I\'ve been on.</P>'

'My daughter found it very hard to jon in floor time. she couldn\'t stand having every one so close to her. She used to sit on a chair just outside the circle with her Aide so she could still see and hear what was happening and join in. Also they had puzzles, and beads(her favourite toys) to play with while they did floortime. My son (also autistic) had his own special mat to sit on - a holden car mat because he loves holdens) and this helped him to stay seated on the floor with everyone else. Be sure to ask the parent what the childs interests are. Liz<div class=\'post_sig\'>- onlinedizzy  2 kids on the Spectrum make life twice as nice</div>'
'We delayed kindergarten for my son who has a June birthday. I enrolled him in our local Head Start program which he went to 4 days a week for almost 4 hours a day and then 3 days a week in ECSE. He also got PT, OT and did gymnastics to help him catch up on many things. We also did a few social skills groups outside of Head Start (which did tons of social skills stuff with all of the kids).<br><br>Our dev ped said that if you are going to hold your child out from kindy - list the reasons why. And then address them all that year that you hold them out. Otherwise, it wasn\'t a good idea. Note that the child doesn\'t need to attain all the goals that you may have listed - but that hopefully they have made progress.<br><br>We have not regretted holding him out. He is in 2nd grade now and his gross motor skills are getting more on par with the kids in his class. We did intensive PT that year we held him and it helped SO much! He learned how to ride a bike without training wheels and use moon shoes and a pogo stick - and all sorts of stuff that kids do. He enjoys playing basketball and football as well.<br><br>Academically, he is doing well. Socially, he has three really good friends and everyone tells me that he is well-liked. When I go to school to volunteer, the kids all talk to him and don\'t look at him strange (well, unless he\'s having an off day and is acting strange). They generally seem happy to see him whenever we see someone from his class.<br><br>Now, this is our experience and every child/family situation is different. You have to decide what is best for you. <br><br>Some districts won\'t let you hold a child out for a year and still provide special ed services. In MN, they let us do that - which we are very thankful for. I\'m not as concerned about the transition years at the end (maybe I\'m naive or just overly optimistic) - but if that is a concern for you, that is definitely something to consider. <br><br>Most people that have held their kids don\'t regret it, but a lot who didn\'t hold their kids do. Research is mixed on the effects. I think not holding can affect a child the first few years - but most research says they eventually catch up. That is with typical kids, so it\'s hard to say for kids with autism.<br><br>My son has always gotten along better with kids who were a year or two younger than him, so this was a good mix for him. He has a lot of social interest, so it helped to have kids around who he was more interested in playing with (younger ones). He got lots more practice with social skills that way, as opposed to being with kids who were mostly older than him (since he has a summer birthday) who might choose to ignore him - which was the case in our old town.<br><br>Again, it is a very personal decision. It\'s hard to know what one is best - but sometimes it helps to hear various perspectives!<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS (9 yo) diagnosed with mild PDD-NOS and DD (6 yo) NT - but definitely a challenge!</div>'

'Calm down. Find out first if you can get him an IEP. Then some of the issues can be addressed through the IEP. Also, since management of his behavior is something that appears to be his greatest school challenge, keeping him at home will not help him learn to manage in a group. Academic progress is the least important predictor of life success. Getting along with others is. Behaving in a way that is welcomed in society is. Think about that.'

'Tzoya, think of it this way, if they have interupted his instruction time, then there is a way of making it up to him.... It could be tutoring him in an area that he is behind on. I myself know of the many battles we have at hand, but they have cheated us and our children of the same amnt. of time as other students and that is something -that is not acceptable! The state is held accountable and they receive funding and we pay our taxes. We have every right to bring it to there attention and now its the\'re choice on doing the right and legal thing. Also, to let you know, it is illegal to have them on the buses for long periods or long commutes. I\'m finding this my way of now probably getting what my son needs in other areas also. I have been fighting for other services and now I\'ve got them at the horns.

'<P>Hi Tammy,</P> <P>My first question is, who administered the ADOS? You probably have the name on paper, but the question really is, is that person a school psychologist, or an autism specialist? A school psychologist is fine, provided that person has experience working with people who have ASD. The results of the ADOS are somewhat subjective, because they depend on the observations of one person (the person who adminstered the test, who can consult with the person who videotaped it). </P> <P>I am sorry, I don\'t know your history, being so new here. But, if the ADOS does not reveal a \"qualifying\" score for ASD, other factors still need to be considered such as observations, and informal tools to examine social understanding, pragmatic language (many of the standardized pragmatic language tests do not reveal the pragmatic language problems in high functioning ASD) and non verbal language.</P> <P>So, a couple of thoughts, if the results of the ADOS feel dramatically wrong to you, perhaps request to have an autism specialist evaluate the videotape and provide an additional set of scores ( if needed), make sure you ask to look at the test protocol (which is the actual score sheet the observer used), or ask that the other measures (2 observations on 2 different days) be looked at more closely.</P> <P>That\'s all I can think of at the moment. </P> <P>Good LUCK! I hope your meeting goes very well.</P>'

'<P>Unless there are out-of-state private schools that are on your \"state approved list\" for special ed placement, the IEP Team does not have the authroity to send your child to a private school. However, you can get them to pay for it anyway, under certain circumstances. An imparital hearing would be required for this. It\'s called a \"Carter case,\" after Shannon Carter, a Florida girl whose parents successfully sued the SD for her tuition at a private placement not approved by the state. Now, it\'s possible for parents to use this precedent to do the same thing. However, the expense, up front, is enormous. And you have to prove 2 things to a hearing officer (or judge if it eventually goes to court). #1 that your child is not being provided FAPE in his current placement (that is unlikely if things are now going well for your son and things remain that way) and #2 that the school YOU have placed him in IS providing FAPE. Yes, you have to place him in the residential school yourself, pay the tuition up front, pay the lawyer up front and wait for reimbursement should the hearing/court case go your way. The cases in my current practicum are almost ALL Carter Cases. It costs parents from $30,000 to over $100,000 UP FRONT. Then, they end up getting reimbursed eventually if they win.</P> <P>Sorry. I don\'t think this was the answer you were hoping for. I\'m really, really glad your son\'s current placement is working. I wouldn\'t worry about the ED designation of the other students. Many probably are Asperger\'s anyway. There\'s a lot of misdiagnosis of that around. Also, many of the ED disorders have symptoms not unlike what our ASD kids go through. As long as your son is placed so that his emotional life is good and he is making progress, that\'s what counts. </P>'
'I have no experience with this, but just opened the post out of curiosity.<br><br>Funny story - my son is completely non-verbal, but his receptive language is 100%. He started a new school in Sept. When we went to \"check in\" on him after week 1, an Aide comes up to us and says \"xmxmnvjfh?\" We smiled, what? She looked puzzled and said \"English is second language in your home, right?\" We said no. She said she assumed since our last name is Russian - that was ds primary language.(yes, it is a crazy free for all at that school - another story). She told us she had been speaking Russian to him all week and he understood her! Of course, we didn\'t believe it. She demonstrated \"sldkdodj\" to ds, and he got up and got crayons. \"ldkdkdod\" he went and packed his bookbag. We were in shock.<br><br>Very, very weird - she did not physically prompt him, but I guess he just got used to her instructions.<br><br>Anyway, maybe ASD kids do have a greater capacity to pick up other languages?<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to Anthony (11-ASD, non-verbal)& Michelle (8-NT)</div>'
'Geez - I almost wish I lived in the US. Where I am (BC, Canada), the <br />school district doesn\'t provide <u><strong>any</strong></u> summer services. <br /> <br />We\'ll be signing Donny up for \"Summer Fun\" again this summer, a joint <br />day camp run by the local YMCA and the local Community Living Services. <br />It\'s for kids ages 5-12, NT, or special needs. The kids are divided into <br />three groups, by age, with two Y counsellors to run programs and care for <br />the NT kids in each group, and CLS staff assisting Y staff, and supporting <br />the kids with special needs. Generally, the CLS staff will have 1-3 <br />children to care for each, in addition to helping out with the group as a <br />whole. <br /> <br />It\'s a lot of fun, they play games, go on trips, etc. The cost is $10/day (8 <br />am - 4 pm), and you pack your kid a lunch. The program is in high <br />demand, with way more special needs kids than CLS staff, so you typically <br />don\'t get many days. For instance, this past summer, Donny got all of 6 <br />days <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"> <br /> <br />If I worked, we\'d be in a whole lot of trouble - the local daycares don\'t <br />have the resources to care for a child with autism. The best you can do is <br />the YMCA day care (which during school year is \"after-school program\", <br />and during summer is \"Summer Fun\"), but even during the school year, <br />even if you provide your own staff for your child, you\'re lucky if they can <br />get your kid in for 2 afternoons per week. People in our town with kids <br />with special needs either don\'t work, or have a trusted friend or relative to <br />care for the child. <br /> <br />Our school district doesn\'t <em>really</em> provide ST/PT/OT, even during the <br />school year. They <em>say</em> they do, but it\'s a total cop out: You can ask <br />that your child receive services, and what will happen is the district\'s <br />therapist will \"assess\" your child, and put forth some very, VERY basic <br />recommendations - like maybe half a dozen minor goals. To get this <br />\"assessment\", there\'s usually about a year to a year and a half wait. The <br />therapist doesn\'t actually DO any therapy with your child - it\'s up to the <br />TAs to implement the therapy. The TAs don\'t have the experience or <br />time. Donny was seen by the district speech therapist in Grade 1, and <br />has been wait-listed to see her again ever since. He\'s seen the OT/PT <br />person twice, once in Kindergarten, and once this year, for observation. <br /> <br />Further, if you provide your OWN PT/OT/ST, like most of the parents in <br />BC do, they cannot go into the school. Further, the school can only follow <br />the plan you\'ve paid for privately, if it is first signed off by the district\'s <br />relevant therapist. <br /> <br />It\'s totally ridiculous. <br /> <br />As a result, Donny\'s only official therapy, even during the school year, is 1 <br />hour per month of combined PT/OT. We did pay for 12 hours of ST this <br />past year, to get assessments and a plan put together. We do everything <br />else ourselves. <br /> <br />Right now, I\'m trying to hire a student to do 10 hours of ABA per week, <br />under my direction, and can\'t even find anyone. To use one of the local <br />ABA companies, I\'d be paying WAY more - $175/hr for consultants, who <br />must see him at least 10 hours per month, plus their billing for <br />coordinating the program, and then pay for the therapy itself on top of <br />that. <br /> <br />Ugh - now I\'m going to go and feel sorry for myself <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley7.gif\" border=\"0\"> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Donny 13 - classic autism, bipolar</div>'

'<P>I have requested to meet with the school pyschologist prior to the testing which will start next week.</P> <P>Here is a little background.. my son is 8yr and dx with autism. Last time he was tested was in March 2006. Most of his testing came back well below average aside from reading which is scored WAY above average. Overall is IQ came back as a 69 which but him within range for MR. Needless to say this was very shocking to us and upsetting.

I feel this is a REALLY sensitive area for me.<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"></P> <P>- If you notice he is having a \"off\" day and extremely not paying attention will you continue testing him or reschedule?</P> <P> </P> <P>I think that sums it up.

'<P>hi all, I only joined the forum today. I am a special education and have been working with children with autism for over 10 years now. I noticed on the forum there are lots of questions etc I may be able to help out with, so thought I would join. I also see a lot of my past students at home and do some one on one tutoring, offer support and advice regarding a range of issues, in particular behaviour support and set up intervention programs. I also do some consultancy to schools and kindys as an independent advocate. At this stage I am doing this a \'favours\' outside of my fulltime teaching role. however, I am hoping to grow my little passion for this area into a mobile service and thought I would just put it out there to gain some idea of people\'s insteres in something like this service. </P> <P>sarah </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- sarahweb</div>'
'<P>Hi everyone!</P> <P>My DS is nearly 4, and we don\'t have an official DX yet. The pediatrician felt he was pdd-nos, and referred us to a developmental behavioral pediatrician. We are currently on the waiting list to be seen. I didn\'t want to wait months to get him some help, so in May i had him evaluated by the school district. The psychologist felt he just had some developmental delays, and would be fine after some therapies. She would eval. him again in the fall and we would officially qualify for services. Over the summer, we did 12 wks of social skills therapy, and began speech therapy this August. I have watched my little boy come out of his shell this summer! He\'s done amazing! 2 weeks ago, he was re-evaluated by the psychologist at the special ed preschool in our school district. She was amazed w/his progress. She said they where really on the fence about whether or not he needs services, but decided to recommend him. Our case conference is 10/2, and at that point everything will become official, and he will have an IEP. My concern is, my DS has some sensory issues. I have a nagging feeling that they will not write OT into his IEP, and he really, really needs it. I can\'t get him OT at the therapy center we attend w/o a DX, and it could be a few more months before we get one/if we get one. </P> <P>Can anyone tell me what my options are w/the school system IF they don\'t write OT into his IEP? I am willing to fight them tooth and nail for it, if I have to.</P> <P>I\'m not sure we exactly belong on an autism forum, but I didn\'t know where else to go for advice on this sort of an issue.</P> <P>tia.</P>'
'Yea, I can call an IEP meeting when I want, was just hoping they wouldnt make it so hard. I put it in writing at his last school, so I\'m not above doing that. And with him being in the back, his teacher couldnt really say why he was, I\'m guessing she didnt take his learning issues into consideration when making the seating chart, which is why I want a meeting so they truly understand him. This particular school has gotten alot better over the years, but when my husband went there, the kids with learning issues tended to be pushed through etc. Well that sooo will not happen with my child, and when I seen his seat in the back, thats how I felt. Little do they know, they cannot pull a quick one with me lol..Thx for the input though, good to hear sometimes I\'m not being crazy! :)<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Kimberly    Son Kameron 9 PDD-NOS, Mixed receptive/expressive language disorder  Kaitlyn 5 NT</div>'

'<P>Jean </P> <P>From what I am reading in my statesboard of education Special education rules is that either you or the school can ask for a due process hearing.

'<P><FONT size=3>Hi everyone. I have a 6yr old son Adam. He has Asperger. We just found out about 7 mo ago. His kindergarten teacher was wonderful. She understood and took some training for autism, went through the whole process with us. Adam is now in first grade and has a new teacher. I don\'t think she has had any training in autism. I recieved a note last friday and was asked how to stop him from stimming. He sings, clicks and hums a lot. He has been injured 3 times so far this year from other students, the teacher says she can\'t do anything about it because she hasn\'t seen it happen. Adam won\'t tell because he was told to worry about himself and not what others are doing, we all know how they love rules. I also found out yesterday that his teacher walked up and gave him an \"angry look\", but never said anything. I asked Adam what he was doing at the time and he of course didn\'t know. I also found out that he has some new students in his class and one has threatened to beat him up and another has started calling him names. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=3>I would go to the old teacher for her advice on the new, but she has left to open a new school.

'I recently pulled my 5yo dd out of her mainstream K class and put her in self contained. We tried letting her get used to the mainstream during the summer pre-k program (lots of problems) and even after school started it was just too much for her even with supports, sensory area, little walks to calm her,everything we could think of. She was just too stimulated all of the time, her aide was well meaning but untrained so basically useless. Meltdowns constantly and too many other kids to deal with so she was just allowed to go on the computer all day. Now she\'s very happy to be in a class where they \"get her\". I just wish I had done it from the beginning. My dd is very advanced academically but if they can\'t ever settle down to do their work what\'s the point? For us mainstreaming was a huge waste of time.'

'<P>It\'s hard to give a wholey constructive opinion not knowing your daughter and her needs, nor knowing the school system. My basic philosophy is to support inclusion as much as possible. It is in this setting where she will receive instruction at a pace aligned with children her same age, and she will also have social models her own age. If inclusion can\'t meet all needs (with accommodations/modifications), then supplement with special education addressing the specific instructional needs. If needs are very intensive, then replace with specialized instruction. Based on your description and my philosophy, I would consider placing your daughter in a regular education class with supplementary, targeted special education instruction. </P>'
'<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=1>Hi everyone- My name is Julie and I\'m brand new here. I\'ve spent the last day or so reading through many posts and think you ladies (and guys) are very insightful. I apologize in advance because I know this is going to be a rather lengthy post. I really hope a few of you at least will take the time to read it and respond... I\'m feeling pretty alone in my struggle at the moment if the truth be told.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=1>My son is eight, 3rd grade, dx with PDD-NOS, ADHD and an Anxiety Disorder when he was five. He is in a Life Skills Class (only option other than general ed. class). Cognitively he is fairly high functioning; socially/behaviorally he is similar to what you would expect of a NT four year old.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>Having him in the Life Skills Class has always proven to be a bit of a struggle when it comes to getting him academic work that is at his level. He reads at grade level and is probably at about a beginning 2nd grade level for math and writing. Most of the other kids in the class don\'t function that close to their grade level, so most activities are geared to their abilities more than his. However, I\'ve always felt that for the time being, this was a more appropriate placement than a general ed. class would be for him in part because of his social/behavior issues.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>We started the process of reviewing his IEP on Tuesday and I think I really rocked the boat. The subject of his reading level came up and the teacher said that they have no curriculum at his level in the room. So, I asked why he couldn\'t get whatever the general ed. 3rd graders are reading and do that. The 3rd grade teacher he is assigned to said she would be willing to provide, the Life Skills teacher didn\'t seem too pleased with the idea. We weren\'t able to work through the entire IEP in the meeting, so we have another one scheduled.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>The school has asked to reevaluate him and unofficially I have been told that if he does well enough on the evaluations they intend to force him to go to his neighborhood school (there was never any discussion of a major change of placement at the meeting). The school he is in now was our neighborhood school until we moved in May. The neighborhood school has NO Life Skills, NO Resource Room. They would put him in a general ed. class for the full day with an aide for part of the day. They say that behavior and social skills deficits are not a reason to keep him in Life Skills if he is academically at grade level. They appear to be totally ignoring his Anxiety Disorder and the issues associated with it. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>I just can\'t wrap my brain around a full day in general ed being an appropriate placement. Just for starters, large groups of children really agitate him to the point he can\'t function and yes he gets what is being taught in a specialized setting, but I don\'t believe he would really get it in a general setting. Also, his attention span is so short; last year one of his goals was to be able to sit for a 20 minute math lesson/activity period, by the end of the year he had worked up to ten minutes.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>I have even greater fears on the social perspective. It took him 2 1/2 years in that class to really began interacting with the kids. Now for the first time, he ackowledges a couple of them as friends (his only friends). Plus, he is having issues with self esteem right now, thinking he is a loser, calling himself a jerk, etc. Add to that the fact that in the last few months we have moved and his dad left for an extended military deployment and I\'m afraid that one more major change would be just too much for him. He is still somewhat traumatized over moving and having serious attachment issues since his dad left. I always thought I would be shouting from the rooftops with excitement the day they told me they believed he was ready for a general ed class; but sadly I feel that this is not the proper time and they are just trying to get me out of their hair. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>I would be supportive of a plan that had him remaining in that school, spending part of the day in his current Life Skills class and part of the day in the general ed. class. Then, possibly considering the move to the new school perhaps next year.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>I\'m reading everything I can get my hands on, but it seems that most of the info is about how to get children into inclusive classrooms... not much on keeping them in a Life Skills or self contained class. I really am kind of at a loss as to where to go from here or how to effectively fight them on it. I am looking for an advocate in the area.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>I really appreciate you taking the time to read my ramblings... sorry it went on for so long.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1></FONT> </P> <P><FONT size=1>Julie</FONT></P> <P> </P>'
'<P>I was so glad to find this site. I often feel totally alone out here, educating children with significant disabilities in a small town. When I came here, they were 20 years behind in Special Education. Now, 18 years later, we\'re maybe 10 years behind but we\'ve started to backwards in the last few years. Anyway, the nagging questions I have about BIPs are:</P> <P>1. What do you do when the behavior communicates \" I don\'t want anything to do with anything you want me to do!\"?</P> <P>2. What do you do when you can\'t find any powerful reinforcers that you have control over?</P> <P>I would like to know more about relaxation routines but the student I\'m most concerned about doesn\'t really exhibit his behaviors under stress. I just can\'t get through to him. He doesn\'t care about anything in our world. I struggle to find educational goals that will mean something to him. I also have a concern about stims. For years, I\'ve just felt stims served a purpose and the kids would abandon them once I taught them something else to do but every once in awhile I run across a kid whose stim is so pervasive you can\'t get through to them or their stim is so socially unacceptable that I need to reduce it before I have time to teach something else.

'We actually started doing the communication only by <br />letter or e-mail and they DO NOT like this at all. They <br />have actually refused to do so at times. My dh explained <br />that with his work schedule most times that is the best <br />way for him to communicate with them. They tell you to <br />come to them with your concerns and when you do, they <br />don\'t like it. We aren\'t allowed to ask questions about <br />anything. We are having to watch our backs because I <br />don\'t know what they are gonna pull next. The way I see <br />things right now, the district office and anyone in it <br />only want to back each other up.

'<P>Hi all,</P> <P>New here. I\'m in Oklahoma and about 5 weeks ago started doing homebased schooling with my high functioning 8 y/o daughter. Homebased meaning I get the curriculim from the school and she still recieves her special services.</P> <P>One problem I\'m having is this homework we\'re supposed to do is so gosh darned boring! No color, hardly any pictures. No wonder she can barely read! She knows about 40 words from the 100 word list they say a first grader should know and she\'s in the second grade.</P> <P>I would like to know if there is <strong>one</strong> program anyone would recommend that would help us out. Unfortunately I\'m no rocket scientist and I need lesson plans laid out for me. So, it could be a computer program or a book but I need something to get this girl going that\'s interesting. She does love to look at photos and I\'m busy doing some flash cards with words that feature her and family members, pets, local businesses. etc. I did see a book online that had sample lesson plans...<strong>The Reading Lesson: Teach your child to read in 20 easy lessons</strong></P> <P>Has anyone tried that one?</P> <P>I do modify the school\'s work....let her type spelling words, I type answers to things she circles them...etc. Just looking for something inspirational here in the reading dept. if anyone can help.</P> <P>Thanks,</P> <P>Cara</P>'

'<P>Homework, what a nightmear! Zach doesn\'t have homework yet but his sisters OYE! His oldest sis get\'s homework Monday thru Thrusday, weekends off. But his younger sister is in a different school program than them. She has homework SEVEN days a week! Mon. thru Fri. 30 min. of reading chapter books. Math M-F, flashcards 7 days a week, and spelling words M-T with a test on F. On weekends she has a TWO page paper to write and turn in first thing on Monday morning. She also does ballet on Thrusday nights so that is a real nightmear for us here. Her sister just does swimming on Saturdays so her schedule is so much easier. </P> <P>I always find it intresting how different the same school district can be on homework.

My son is mainstreamed in a reg 1st grade class. There is no reason for them to not follow an IEP actually it is against the law to do that . If your child is classified and should be with an IEP then they have to write the IEP as to follow your child\'s placement and with all the modifications and accomidamtions the child needs. DO NOT SETTLE FOR A 504 he cannot get allt he services that are out there for him. Calll COSAC if you have any questions look them up online and talk to someone.

'<P>It\'s only the potty training thing everyhting else is going pretty well. I had a meeting and was about to have another with the school but they got an aide but it\'s for every child in the class. This is a typical school my daughter is almost 5 yrs and it is Pre-k. Since they got an aide i sent in a chart to tell me when my daughter is dry/wet and how frequently my daughter is taken to the potty. </P> <P>So the family worker comes out telling me shes confused and so is the aide that the aide is for the other kids too. So who the heck is gonna take my daughter more frequently?!!! Also the school has another aide in the class as well to help out what the heck is their problem. So i had a meeting to get an aide for other kids that mostly all are potty trained and they can\'t take my daughter more to the potty or track it? I\'m angry because we were gonna have a meeting and i should be making the potty goals more specific. If i want to ask for a new \"Norap\" (hopefully i spelled that right) do we need to have a meeting? The stupid teacher that takes care of the IEP is nowhere and she isnt taking my calls now everyone claims she isnt there. Why should i be working hard at home to get my daughter trained but yet at school they wait 2 hrs and then take her with the rest of the class, shes having leaks and all in her pull-up. The PCA was taken out of her IEP now i have to fight to get it back in and the school wont budge trying to tell me i will need to fight for it again once she goes to kindergarten. I am not stupid once something is in the IEP it stays unless it is agreed to be taken out, am i wrong? </P>'

'I think it is very hard for teachers to give our kids everything they need. They have over 20 other students in the class and ours is not the only one with special needs. All children have needs and they need to spend their time proportionally for all kids. This is why mainstreaming can be so difficult. <br>I know that one year I had a child who was mentally ill and he consumed so much energy and time that I worried constantly that the other kids did not learn or get as much attention as they deserved. <br>I think that as a teacher and a mom of a child with autism it is important to make sure that the teacher has enough of support and education. Special educators could help by covering the classroom so the classroom teacher could spend quality time with student with special needs.<br> In my experience it is the aide who ends up teaching our kids and this takes away from classroom teachers control and relationships. Most teachers are doing a great job. We just need to be aware of the limitations.<br>Cecelia<br>Mom to Emily,9, and Nick, 7<br>'

Maybe you can talk to Bailey\'s doc too and come to an agreement on what you\'ll be asking for, so he can write the letter accordingly?<BR><BR>Unless you are going to be using medications too - you might not want that mentioned either. Like, if you are waiting before starting any, the school can use that to say, well - this won\'t work unless you medicate him. Maybe or maybe not, but that statement shouldn\'t be given the chance to impact how or how much they offer to help.

'<P>He sounds wonderful! I would try mainstreamed too..he will gets the best modeling kids there and the teacher can use lots of behavior modification to get him to follow rules. I would practice now and through summer to work with him on attending and listening skills and rules. transitioning to other activities ect...... </P> <P>A great DVD for our kids starting school and modeling what is expected is from Modelmekids called <strong>\"Time for school\"</strong> It is loaded with real kids and step by step the rules of school like \" sitting and looking at teacher\" and \"standing in line\", \"sitting in circle time\" , \"listening to a story\" and peer social rules and many more...it comes with a cd-rom free to print out \"social stories\" to reinforce the DVD... the video uses real kids to model the whole time and lots of visuals and pauses to reinforce the skill. </P> <P> We used this on in our ABA program and <strong>\"Time for playdate</strong>\" is great for social skills like greetings,sharing, taking turns, looking, responding, what to do when others \"dont\" want to do what you want, ..losing..congratulating the winner..ect..Look online for website and check them out.
