'<P>I actually respectfully disagree IBGECKO. ODD is often a comorbid disorder with HFA/AS. ODD is oppositional defiant disorder in case anyone is wondering.</P> <P>I think it would be a very wise idea to get him checked out by a developmental pediatrician (these docs have an additional 2 years of training in developmental issues past their pediatric training) and/or a pediatric neuropsychologist. Rages/tantrums are not uncommon among kids on the spectrum. I personally feel that ODD is just a part of some kids\' autism spectrum disorder and I know there are others that agree with me.</P> <P>I\'m not qualified to diagnose either - especially without seeing your child. However, the sensory issues, lack of eye contact, playing better with younger children, difficutly with expressive language and inappropriate expression of emotions are hallmarks of being on the spectrum. But again, you need to see a professional to really make sure. I would ask around and see who the best person to see is - not all professionals are created equal! <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley2.gif\" border=\"0\"> You might check at your local ARC agency and/or an autism/Asperger\'s support group. Parents of kids on the spectrum are the best resource for finding out who to see - they have fought hard to get what they have and usually are VERY willing to help those coming after them!

'Have you visited the classroom they are proposing putting him in? I would do that before I\'d agree to any placement. Of course, you\'ll have to remember that the kids you\'re seeing today are a year older than your son is now, but seeing a placement is the best way to know what possible issues will be. He may need a consultant to come in to bring the teacher and staff up to speed on his issues. He may need a one-on-one aide. He may not need much of anything. Seeing what the situation is will help you understand what he WILL need.'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I\'ve gotten myself very confused. DD was on Custom D-lactate Free until a few days ago. I thought she had a flare up of clostridia after a parasite cleanse, and I increased the probiotic and this seemed to help. She said the poop hurt, not while she was pooping, but on her skin, so that is why I thought the poop might have had an increase in acidic bacteria (?)  We switched her to VSL3, and overall it seems like a good change for her, but today she woke up from her nap hysterical and didn\'t calm down until I put her in a baking soda bath. Could she have gotten acidic from the VSL? Or from die off from the VSL?  Also I am noticing a few crystals in her diaper. She got this before, before we went on the LOD. Could switching to VSL be involved in this?  Overall she seems happier but more ADD-like. The ADD type behavior is typically associated with oxalates for her, but since VSL is supposed to help with oxalates, I\'m confused.  thanks for any advice!

' <div class=\"postbody\">We were only able to attend two days, but it was fantastic. There were SO many people there! It was so therapeutic also, to be in a room with so many other parents going through this. This just had to be the number one thing that made it worth going. When I think of the rough days ahead, I now know that so many others are going through it as well - and even in worse ways.     I learned a LOT about how crucial ALL the pieces are to the process of healing the gut and fixing the methlyation process. I think the overall aim is to heal, then fix this process so that the body can produce glutathione and detox like it should. But every single thing is important . .zinc levels, magnesium, B6, etc. - it all has to be there.    Right now our son is STILL deficient in zinc and magnesium, so the other stuff can\'t work. Now I see why that is all so important and why I have to fix those issues before we can procede.     There are also other metals that can cause problems ...aluminum, antimony, lead, etc. They can be there w/o tests that show they are. Detox is important, either through chelation or natural means.     Anyway, it was GREAT. I feel very empowered and not so alone.  Some of the parent to parent sessions were also fantastic. SCD diet is BIG for a lot of parents/kids right now - more than I knew. I talked to one mom who had used it and made me feel that it was doable for our family as well. I probably will head in that direction soon. - as soon as I can get through this semester in mid-May.     Enzymes were not really stressed, though. I wonder about that. Many parents use them, but don\'t rely on them as the cure-all.    P.S. - I\'m sorry that I did not get to \"see\" any of you that were there. The nametags didn\'t really work that way.

'Another think that you might want to consider. There is some research out there that shows that kids on the autism spectrum don\'t toilet train until they are at the point of putting together two word phrases that are COMMUNICATIVE. This does not seem to be because they need language to learn about toileting. It seems to be neuro/developmental. That the brain is developed enough to toilet train at about the same time it is ready to communicate in more than one word. If you think about it, that\'s EXACTLY how it works with NT kids. NT boys are know to train later and they are also known to talk later. Is it such a shock that our kids, who are know to talk even later, are not ready to toilet until later? If you look at the thread about what age did our kids train, I think you\'ll see that the majority were at least 4, many 5 or even school age. IMHO, these people are trying to do something unnatural with your child. If you feel strongly about it, DO NOT ALLOW IT. As this child\'s parent, you have that right.'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Autism has been around for 60 years and has been closely studied for decades by psychologists and related professionals.   If autism and giftedness are related, this relationship would  have been uncovered long time ago.  There is no scientific study to my knowledge that shows autism and giftedness are significantly correlated.   We know that there a few autistic savants (the number is small and in double digits, compared to perhaps hundreds of thousands of autistics around the world).     I have looked at gifted student population in my school district and it\'s around 10% of the general student population which means 90% of general population are not gifted.  So, even if 10% of the autistics are gifted, we have an overwhelming majority of 90% of autistics who are not gifted.           If autistic people are gifted, where are they?   Is there any autistic among top 100 living musicians, writers, architects, painters, mathematicians etc.             It\'s possible that autism and giftedness are related and autism may be suppressing the giftedness.  What\'s the point of this giftedness? It\'s like trading your eyes for a nice painting.      I too wish to believe that autism is giftedness but the evidence we have so far point to that autism -- for the most part-- is a profound disability.</div>'

'Give it until the end of the school year before making a class change. When my DD first started pre-school, it was really rough and she made limited progress from Sept through January. That was when we moved her to the special ed pre-school at the school district. From Feb-June, again, she made limited progress and it was downright discouraging at times. The next school year she did much better. She did a total turn around, and during that school year she started attending kindergarten for 2 hours. By the end of the year she was full time in kindergarten. I think she had to get used to the setting and her communications had to improve before her overall performance improved. I also think having role models for behavior helped. If she had been in the class with lower functioning kids, she wouldnt have developed as fast as she did. Good luck, focus on the postive. Observe the other class. If you feel your child is too high functioning, then dont move him. He needs the positive role models that the higher functioning kids will help provide.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Jana</div>'

'You can ask for an FBA at ANY time. And, since it is an evaluation, it is subject to IEE rules, which means you can get an independent eval afterwards if you don\'t agree with it. But, personally, I think it\'s best to go with the results of the FBA and use the resulting BIP (into which you definitely can have input) and the success or failure or the BIP will tell if the FBA is correct. If the BIP fails, have the authors adjust it. This is going to be a process.'

'<P>Okay, after the losing him on the bus incident (see post from a few days ago if you\'re interested), the school seems to be stepping up.</P> <P>The ASD teacher called me to check in and to tell me that ds seems to be anxious toward the end of the day and asking how much longer they have. She said that unless you were looking for it, it is not noticeable and a lot of the other kids (NT) are anxious too because it IS A 6 1/2 hour day. But, she wants to schedule two 10-minute gross motor breaks for ds - one in the am and one in the pm. She will have him deliver mail to different parts of the building and maybe do 2 or 3 different ones so that he gets a long walk and some time away in addition. Also, she\'s going to take him to the resource room to finish lunch if he doesn\'t get to finish. His class has a bathroom break right after lunch which is 10 minutes, so she can give him about 7-8 minutes to finish up (they only get 20 minutes to eat) and then swing him by the bathroom and go to class. All of this will not interfere and not make him stand out. She said he seems to be interacting and is following routines great and doing everything that is asked of him. She just wants to be pro-active and not have his anxiety increase. She told me she didn\'t want him \"sent\" to her room - she wants to invite him to her resource room when he needs it so he ends up being able to eventually do it on his own when he needs it. </P> <P>The principal sat with he and 4-5 other kindergarteners who didn\'t finish their lunch today and chatted with him and made sure he was able to finish more of his lunch. He usually is able to eat in 20 minutes, but with all the noise and the kids talking to him - he just didn\'t budget his time well. </P> <P>Anyway, she also threw out a few other ideas but said she absolutely wants him to be doing everything the other kids are as much as possible and she believes he will be able to and has been impressed with how he has done so far. He is definitely the mildest on her caseolad, she said and she said that a layperson would not pick out that he was even having any issues. She just could read it on his face that he needed a break. So, tomorrow we start doing that. </P> <P>Well, I gotta go get ready for our garage sale, but just had to share that after a rocky start - the school (especially the ASD teacher and principal) seem to really have a handle on my ds - after only really knowing him for 2 1/2 days so far!) is doing good. They are WAY better than his previous school and I actually told the ASD teacher that I was floored that she was calling me to work on PREVENTING a future problem rather than waiting until one happened - because that was not my experience at his previous school. I\'m hoping this continues!</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS (9 yo) diagnosed with mild PDD-NOS and DD (6 yo) NT - but definitely a challenge!</div>'
'I am a teacher in Long Island NY. From what I hear many parents move to Ny and stay here just for the services. Most schol districts offer good prgrams with all of the special services as well as some home beased therapy.'
'I have an in-law who had an asd diagnosis as a kid. Would have never <br />guessed in a million years. I can\'t tell you if his dx was accurate but he <br />appears NT these days (job, wife, kid, friends, hobbies, doing well). I have <br />heard some follow-up studies that say that a number of HFA people will <br />no longer qualify for the dx as adults ( \'Sent in the idiots\' is a recent <br />book written by someone with autism who is pretty close to NT as an <br />adult - though if you look for uplifting books, this might not be it) But <br />more importantly all these people did not have the treatments that are <br />available today. To me that means that there is already an innate ability <br />for some to overcome their weak areas. When I look at my son I often <br />realise that his ablilities in some areas are very weak but they are there <br />and he has the ability to learn. If I could just figure out the most effective <br />way. <br />I can\'t advice you what to do. Your kid probably has a greater chance of <br />recovery with ABA than without. I know families who have moved cross <br />country to be in states who offer the best services and other families who <br />have gone into big time debt.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- micki, mom to three wonderful and wild kids.  ds 10 asperger & anxiety  twin dds 6 quirky but NT this far</div>'
'Hi & welcome. Have you contacted the school district? You will want them <br />to do an evaluation to see if/what services they will offer you. That\'s great <br />that he\'s been successful in preschool, hopefully that will carry over to <br />kindergarten. Search this forum for \"IEP,\" \"Evaluation,\" \"IDEA\" and other <br />posts on this board for help with the school. Learn as much as you can <br />about the laws and what you are entitled to. <br /> <br />Is he in OT or have any sensory integration program? That may help some. <br />You may want to re-post (if you haven\'t yet) on the \"Parents\" board (just <br />above this) about your questions regarding his sleep & other concerns. <br /> <br /><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to 2 Amazing Girls, ages 3 (autism) & 6</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Everyone,    Happy Thanksgiving,    I found a Dan Dr. that said she can help us without having to go into the office for visits. She is in OH I think. I have to call on Monday to schedule a phone consult. has anyone heard of her. She did say that he would probably benefit from b-12 injections so I have to look this up in prior posts. I hope everyone has a great turkey day.    Teri</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Rick thank you very much    I didnt know some could lose it i wa just echoing what i was taught when i was small.        I know about the more severley functioning autistics ive met plenty    I would like to see their lives get better they dont seem too happy to me sometimes  .    sometimes i will admit i have trouble seeing not everyones autism is as high functioning as mine.     and i need to be helped with this and helped to understand what the familys going through so i can help them.     since im the only preson at my leval of it ive ever known personally in my entire 20 year exsistense     if fine Men like you can help these kids and young adults with Biomed go right ahead i find it interesting what you told me about the kids at your clinic.     quite frankly i wish some of these options were availible to me when i was small but i did good with what i could.    It kind of feels like being in suspended animation and waking up in the future when i heard some things it could be overwheliming.    (If youve ever felt anything like that in any situation in your life)      when i first came i didnt know what as going on with autistic people these days and was  shocked <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" />       to hear what you can do for young kids with asd now      that you couldent in 1991 when all of my problems happened    i felt lost in the past i felt like iwas getting older and no one cared about me anymore or people my age for that matter who have asd.        My freinds and social life are VERY limited i thank god for my family    I find regressive autism interesting    same as with the shots i really believe iwas born with mine.     but i dont really know what causes it in general they are still trying to figure that one out.     im a very simple young Man      i didnt say i wouldent be cured     i was just scared because i didnt know what to expect if it were to happen.       :  shock:  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" />          i dont want to do anything i might have to pay for when i die  that i thought might be right but wasnt i dont want to offend god if i was meant to be autistic because i love him very much.     im just scared of thinking about it ive been this way for 20 years i dont know what it would be like alot of adult autistics dont      we feel forgotten which leads to bitterness and hate no one wants to feel forgotten.      I think its is just a disability though.      You are a sweet and fine man <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />      i think you help these nice people out even more then i do it is a pleasure to have met you as well you are helping these kids in alot of ways and i really respect you for that.        raising the leval of functioning is what i was thinking all along im glad you confirmed it.        i saw an email you sent to my mom a few weeks ago when i was checking her email      like i usually do for her.       about the whole compounding crises thing one morning     Shes not really that active in the current scene of things though.       and i was happy to see your name on the email <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /> I think you are a very nice man and Very Much appreciate        This reminds me of a scene in a movie i saw called Vanilla Sky that had tom cruise in it.    and he was told he had died and was in a sort of dreamworld for a while and was given the choice of whether he wanted to continue dreaming or wake up and be born again      I kind of feel a little like his charachter did in that scene        , Happy ,sad,scared,relieved , a strange mix of all emotions      Your Patience, Explanations, and kind compliment that really made me smile <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />            <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ high functioning Autistic 21 year old</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ high functioning Autistic 21 year old</div>'

'I posted here a couple of weeks ago about the problems my marriage was <br />going through because we didn\'t know what was going on with my son, <br />we still don\'t but the marriage is definitely looking a whole lot better. <br /> <br />We both are enjoying our child, and not worrying about the \"what ifs\". <br /> <br />As for my son, he is 2 years and 1 month old now <br /> <br />Eye contact is good, but could be better <br />Eats well <br />Sleeps fine <br />Loves company <br />Remembers all his ASL signs (over 25 now) <br />No stacking <br />No lining up toys <br />Does not talk except \"mamama, dada and aaahdone (all done)\" <br />Has stopped covering his ears from loud sounds, started shrugging a <br />little though <br />Can identify around 40 animals, again same issue, won\'t say the word, <br />but will point at the \"rhinoceros\" when asked. <br />Drinks well <br />takes a 2hr ish afternoon nap daily <br />still doesn\'t like to me cuddled, but is coming along, he rested his back <br />on my stomach today in the living room floor watching cartoons <br /> <br />plays with a lot of toys, but is kinda fond of any kind of phone, he\'ll walk <br />around the house with my wife\'s cell phone acting like he is talking, he <br />basically walks around babbling. He imitated this with a hair brush today <br />as well, I thought it was odd, but oh well. <br /> <br />The only thing that drains us is that even though he is happy a lot, he <br />*hates* being changed and fights it to no end. He doesn\'t like brushing <br />his teeth either. <br /> <br />I don\'t know whats going to happen, all I know is through the encouragement and understanding of people on this board I feel very <br />positive about my life regardless of what my child\'s diagnosis is, although <br />there some times during the day at work where I get pre-occupied <br />wondering about autism and ppd, but there is nothing I can do except <br />keep reinforcing what his therapists teach him and hope there is no <br />regression. <br /> <br />Thanks for reading.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Father of 4yr old son w/autism.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">That\'s wonderful! I\'m glad you figuring out some of the pieces of the puzzle. After a year and a half of biomed, I still can\'t figure out when my son has yeast. He is a hard one to figure out! On the primal defense- are you giving it just when you notice yeasty behaviors or everyday as maintenance? I have been giving my son some every other night but only like 1/4 teaspoon. Thanks so much!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Heather</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Heather</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">My son has had a very positive out come from the medidate.  On a brighter note, the bully is being expelled from school.  He locked another kid (not S.) in a closet and threw a book at S..      Plus some mother (wonder who it could be?) wrote letters to the spiritual director of the school, the head of the PTA, the head of the order of sisters that run the school, and the bishop about the continued bullying.  That mother all sent copies of each letter written to the principal to the above people and threatened to attend class EVERY DAY with S. until the bullying was addressed.  Unfortunately, the one who loses is the bully.  My son will be fine.  The bully is really a very confused , unhappy, ourt of control 6 year old that can\'t understand why no one likes him.     liz, good luck with your son\'s doctor\'s appointment.  Definetely research the side effects.  We didn\'t tell S. what they were because he is a bit of hypocondriac and would have every symptom..........</div>'
