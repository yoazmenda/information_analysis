Here are it\'s uses:</FONT></strong></P> <P><strong>PRESCRIBED FOR:</strong> Diphenhydramine is used for the relief of nasal and non-nasal symptoms of various allergic conditions such as seasonal allergic rhinitis. It is also used to treat patients with chronic urticaria. Although antihistamines are the preferred class of drugs in allergic rhinitis, they only reduce symptoms by 40-60%. Diphenhydramine also is used for allergic reactions involving the eyes (allergic conjunctivitis), to prevent or treat active <A href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/&#115;cript/main/art.asp?articlekey=9485\" target=\"_blank\"><FONT color=#0033cc>motion sickness</FONT></A>, and for mild cases of Parkinsonism, including drug-induced Parkinsonism. The last two uses (motion sickness and Parkinsonism) are based on the anticholinergic effects of diphenhydramine, and not its antihistamine effects. Diphenhydramine also is used as an aid for insomnia.</P> <P><strong><FONT color=#990099 size=4>I found this too!! I feel better!</FONT></strong></P> <P><B>PREGNANCY:</B> Diphenhydramine has been used extensively in pregnant women; the incidence of fetal malformations is the same as that which would be expected in women who are not taking medications. Additionally, studies in animals suggest no important effects on the fetus. Diphenhydramine, therefore, can be used in pregnancy if the physician feels that it is needed. </P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Holly_WA on July 04 2007 at 7:07pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- http://themeluginmonkeys.blogspot.com    Holly-mom to:    DH-David-Aspergers  Sarah-14y Anxiety  Rachel-13y Severe anxiety, Bipolar, ADD, LD\'s, CAPD  Jacob-9y HFA, anxiety, ADHD  Anna-7y anxiety???</div>'

'I think you\'re right to worry! Even a service dog still needs exercise, <br />training, grooming, feeding, and to have it\'s poop scooped!!! <br /> <br />The first thing to ask yourself, other than whether you\'re ready for all the <br />responsiilities that come with dog ownership, is what specific function <br />you\'re hoping the dog will fulfill with your daughter. <br /> <br />If you\'re wanting a dog to prevent your child from wandering, or find your <br />child should she wander off, you\'ll need a specially trained dog from a <br />major service dog organization. <br /> <br />If you\'re wanting a dog as a companion to your child, who will be her best <br />friend and help engage her, draw her out of herself, and give her a sense <br />of responsibility and self-esteem, then, provided your daughter actually <br /><em>likes</em> dogs, any old mutt will do! <br /> <br />We have three dogs, all rescues, and they\'re great for Donny. They\'ve <br />been good in teaching boundaries/appropriate behaviour around animals, <br />and in getting him to engage with another in a forceful, intentional, direct <br />manner. Dogs don\'t respond to \"sit\", when it\'s said from 5 feet away in a <br />sing-song voice by someone who\'s not looking at them - Donny\'s having <br />to learn to get eye contact, face the animal, stand tall, and firmly say \"sit\", <br />while using the hand signal. It\'s worth it to him, as he finds it very <br />rewarding when an animal responds to his directive. Donny also <br />practices following directions around making their food, putting it down, <br />putting a leash and collar on them, walking them, etc. <br /> <br />He absolutely LOVES our one little dog, and she\'s fantastic at cheering <br />him up when he\'s cranky - she would be considered a \"therapy dog\" I <br />think. <br /> <br />That said, I don\'t leave the dogs alone with Donny, he\'s not allowed to <br />walk them by himself. HE is too unpredictable, and dogs are only dogs <br />afterall! There\'s still a good amount of time where he\'s not appropriate <br />with them. He has a hard time understanding that they don\'t understand <br />screeching gibberish mixed with the words \"go away!\", shoving hands, <br />and nervous giggling. We\'re always talking about being nice to the dogs, <br />and if he doesn\'t want them near, either sit on a piece of furniture, or be <br />in his room (he tends to go lay on the floor by a dog, flop around, then <br />get grouchy when the dog gets excited and tries to lick him and play). <br /> <br />Also, breed does NOT matter. If you get a dog, choose a dog based on <br />what your family needs. If you\'re strapped for time already, I\'d choose a <br />sturdy, short-coated breed that can do without a ton of exercise. <br />However, know even the most low-maintenance dog is still going to need, <br />at the very least, a daily walk and two 10-15 minute training sessions per <br />day.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Donny 13 - classic autism, bipolar</div>'

'Whew! Today was the first day back at school. It was only a short day, <br />from 8:30-10:30, and Don managed to stay for half of that. First day is <br />always challenging because he\'s very keyed up (all the kids are), and it\'s <br />completely chaotic - kids haven\'t been sorted into classrooms yet, there\'s <br />no teaching or planned activities, etc. <br /> <br />Don woke up this morning, excited but nervous. He was still <br />apprehensive that we\'d be taking him to his old (bad) school, and kept <br />looking down the street at it, despite my reassuring him that he wasn\'t <br />going there, but was going to his school (some of y\'all might remember <br />he switched schools midway through last year, due to serious issues at <br />the school he was in). <br /> <br />When we arrived at school, the parking lot was a mess, there wasn\'t even <br />any parking. I had to park in the handicapped spot. We headed inside, <br />and it was very crowded and noisy. His classroom was overflowing into <br />the hallway - because classes haven\'t been sorted yet, they piled all <br />registered Gr. 4 kids (60 of them), plus their parents who\'d come with, <br />into a single classroom. We had to push through a line of people at the <br />back of the class, and ask a woman to please move, as she was sitting in <br />Donny\'s seat (he\'s got a special work area at the back of the class, as well <br />as a regular desk). About 5-10 minutes in, the teachers managed to <br />divert half the kids and parents into another room, thank goodness! <br /> <br />Don then got to sit in a desk, with a book, while the teacher talked about <br />expectations, and all the other orientation stuff, and handed out planners <br />and school supply lists. At one point, Donny put up his hand, and, when <br />the teacher called on him, said the teacher\'s name. The teacher <br />responded with, \"yes?\", and Don had completely forgotten what he was <br />going to say, so said, \"Everybody, jargonjargonjargon Transform.\" <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley36.gif\" border=\"0\"> <br />The teacher was a bit puzzled, so I just quickly inserted that Donny was <br />saying he was happy to be there with everyone <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"> <br /> <br />He did great with listening to and following instructions on a little ice <br />breaker activity (write your name on a slip of paper, toss it on the floor, <br />then pick one up - the name on your paper is who you interview). He was <br />a bit overwhelmed being interviewed, even with my and the TAs help, as <br />it meant all the kids were talking at once, and people were moving <br />around a bit in the room, but he did pretty well. It helped that the girl <br />interviewing him was a friend from last year. <br /> <br />Then, when it was his turn to interview someone, it was a bit goobered up <br />- the girl he was to interview was trying to interview another girl at the <br />same time. Don was trying to ask her the questions (with prompting), <br />but, as she was distracted, talking with the girl she was interviewing, it <br />was pretty overwhelming. He started to shut down with all the noise - it <br />was interesting, as it\'s the first time I\'ve been able to actually witness him <br />going into sensory overload. His eyes were getting glazed, and he was <br />having a hard time looking at anything, and it was obviously becoming <br />more and more difficult for him to hear. He started to look frightened - I <br />never realized before watching that what a scary experience it must be for <br />a kid to get overloaded that way. His TA and I managed to get his focus <br />long enough to ask him if he wanted a break (he did), and we got him out <br />of the class. <br /> <br />He went to his old classroom (which was empty), and drew on the board <br />for a bit, obviously trying to refocus. He then went back to his current <br />class, and was upset that it was still chaotic and noisy. He tried to run <br />out, and when I asked him to wait, he screeched once, but when I stopped <br />him and asked for words, he said (almost crying, poor guy <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"> ), \"May I <br />go on the computer please\". We had him put his book away, and went <br />down to the computer room. He was trying to wind down on that, and <br />then the computer froze... <br /> <br />He, understandably, started to meltdown a bit, kept saying, \"stupid, not <br />working!\", and started banging his fist on the table. He really wanted to <br />shut it down - it was hard for him to leave it there not working. We left <br />for a treat and then home - he was almost crying, from being <br />ovewhelmed, stressed out, and frustrated. He was convinced he\'d had a <br />bad day. <br /> <br />Now we\'re home and he\'s had a Rootbeer float from the drive thru, some <br />tortilla chips, and is watching Tree House. He\'s starting to wind down, <br />and is pretty tired. He\'s now recognizing that he did AWESOME, and Mom <br />and Dad are really proud of him.

'<P>I\'m catching up on my reading as we were out of town for a few weeks. The \"OT\" part of this thread caught my eye, as my family tree (and perhaps DH\'s) is not the greatest in terms of DDs.</P> <P>I have/had 2 brothers with downs syndrome, so yes, Tzoya, it does happen. And it is rare, as we never met another family like ours. My brothers were born in 1961 and 1964, and genetics studies were like a pipedream compared to the knowledge of today. These brothers came along AFTER my essentially NT sister and myself. In fact, my mother became pregnant 5 more times, 3 of which miscarried, one she chose to abort (VERY hard and emotional decision), and the last which resulted in my much younger \"baby\" brother. By societal standards, he is NT. Was my mom irresponsible, etc to get pregnant so many times after already having 2 downs children? No, but this was back when birth control options were not as varied as they are now (is that a good way to put it?).</P> <P>Anyway, our family found out in the early 70\'s that downs CAN be genetic and one parent can have a \"carrier gene\". I don\'t remember the specifics, just that my mother has it, as do I. None of the rest of my immediate family do, according to the geneticists at Johns Hopkins back then. I remember finding this out before I was even a teen, so my \"family plan\" was thought about long before I even wanted to kiss a boy!</P> <P>Fast forward to my 20\'s and having children myself... I have 4, the third one has autism. My last was conceived before Tony\'s evals/dx, so there was no turning back on my youngest. Having known I had the \"carrier gene\" for downs, my husband and I talked at great length with a genetics counselor, or priest, etc. about risking becoming parents. My brothers by this time were adults, and one was already dead. So we looked at having a family a lot differently than our peers. In that vein, I had amnios (sp?) with all 4 of my kids. By the time Tony was in utero, DH and I were more of the opinion that we would not abort if the test results revealed something, we would just be better prepared mentally at birth. Our thoughts on that was that yes, the amnio could reveal SOME disabilities, but not all. I don\'t think there are genetic \"markers\" yet for blindness, hearing impairment, etc. just to name a few \"lifelong\" disabilities.</P> <P>I for one totally respect Tzoya\'s point of view, as someday, in the not too distant future, my downs brother\'s care will fall on my shoulders. I would like to point out that the issue of having \"too many\" children has been a hot issue for years... disabled or not. And my personal opinion comes more from the perspective of living every day life, the financial and societal impact aside.</P> <P>For the last 2 years, I too have been a SAHM. Before that, I was fortunate enough to have my mom available for child care (particularly for Tony) and was able to work full time. For several reasons, I had to quit full-time work then and will be going back to work soon after our big move to DE in a few weeks. I truly believe we all contribute in our own way, and not being an \"individual taxpayer\" does not diminish the value of our contribution to society. There are pros and cons to THAT issue as well.</P> <P>I\'ll get off my soap box now! I really enjoy how everyone on this board feels comfortable sharing their opinions. BTW - we have also been in a 2 bedroom 1 bath home (apt no less) for the last 2 years. So again, I feel the conservatism there... count your blessings its just the 3 of you! <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"></P> <P>Mary</P>'

He falls much more frequently with shoes than without. He also whenever he is walking just wanders around the house aimlessly not playing or anything which I hate.

'<P><EM><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=4>I am new to this whole message board thing, but running out of ways to get information. My daughter got put on Risperdal last week and had 2-3 meltdowns (2 hrs each) for the first 2 days. She just cries and screams very loudly and doesn\'t want anyone to touch her. She seemed to be better the last 3 days, but now she has been back at school for 2 days and they want me to come and get her each time she has a meltdown. I told them I can\'t keep her home the rest of school year and that I think she is doing it somewhat to be able to come home. The doctor says that this is normal and it will take a few weeks for the medicine to adjust. Anyone have advice about what the school says or on the new medicine? I am the step-mom and have only had Chelsea for 6 months now (she moved from CA) and every time I think that things are going in a positive direction I find myself dealing with another new issue.

(I know its hard to trust the people with your child but I suggest phone interviews seeing if the people would be willing to meet with you briefly at a mcDonals playland or a park and start out having respite while you are there for a few hours cleaning so you know how it goes before actually leaving them with your kids!</P> <P>TELL HER you have NO IDEA whats available and you are overwhelmed.... </P> <P>As far as your custody situation playing into getting this help for your boys Im not sure what you mean?

'<P>I don\'t want to go into too much detail but I did want to let people know to check the clinical policy bulletins about coverage options for Autism frequently. I recently noticed a change on Aetna\'s that states intervention including ABA is medically necessary for children with Autism. There is lots of other mumbo jumbo in there and I haven\'t pushed it with them yet because we have a waiver but it sounds promising. It also says that even though Aetna feels it is medically necessary most plans will not include coverage...it is covered through the behavioral health portion which apparently many plans exclude. I am thinking my particular plan includes this because Aetna is reimbursing the state for many of my son\'s therapies. </P> <P>I don\'t really want to share specifics about my employer or the health plan I have but I did want to throw it out there because a couple of years ago this clinical policy bulletin specifically said these treatments were NOT medically necessary. So moral of the story is if you have Aetna as an option check it out to see if your plan covers ABA or other therapies...</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Heather  Mom of 6yo son with mod/sev Autism and severe hemophilia.

I have high blood pressure, fibromyalgia (a pain disorder that is made worse by stress and lack of sleep), arthritis, and abdominal adhesions ( another painful condition from my c-section in 96). I basically function, I don\'t exercise, I can not really plan for spa days or to have coffee with the girls, so whatever I do have time for I make it really count. I purchased a guitar for my bday last month and it has really relaxed me so much. The only problem is with my joint problems I often have stiff hands the next day.

In the problem I posted about, I did not go into details of ds behavior with dd, situations that arise and his reactions toward her - nothing anyone could really pick up on or relate to in regard to their relationship, only because I was concerned about dd and her feelings in this post.<br><br>QUOTE\"that your DS may feel that way towards DD as he sees her basicly excell in life where DS may find it more difficult or even impossible\"QUOTE<br><br>In your rambling way (which is a trait we share) you hit the nail on the head, entirely by accident, for this particular piece of ds puzzle. It took Dr. Phd. BCBA about 8 days of data analyzing and $500 of my money to figure out because it was not a clear cut case, and not simply a matter of ordinary sibling rivalry.<br><br>WHAT WOULD WE DO WITHOUT YOU?! Ramble all you like any time any post, even when your drunk and not making any sense at all - there\'s always something in there, even if just 2 words, that makes a lightbulb go off in someones head here!<br><br>Now, \"<font style=\"font-weight: bold;\" size=\"2\">Jeeze\"</font>, for your \"problem\" (which I have seen you post about before)<br><br>QUOTE\"...work doing the job I do driving forklifts which require no education, I have a nice small home, and may live here forever, never doing better, I want a family someday but that may very well escape me... I remain where I am forever. \"QUOTE<br><br>The \"being\" part of human is the fact that you CAN have whatever tangible things it is your heart desires, IF you TRULY want it. This is not something new, or some crazy way of thinking - it works - trust me, I know. Of course, there are certain things that can never happen, but they really are few and far between. Most important in obtaining WANTS is to not sell yourself short. Set one goal at a time and run with it!!!! There is NOTIME to waste in life - get/take everything it is you want. The road may get bumpy, don\'t give up, figure a way around, there are many avenues to take. The only drawback is that you will have to sacrifice certain things to obtain the one thing that you are currently working toward. I could explain and keep rambling about how, lecturing on can and can\'t, but I\'m sure you know what I mean. The only true reality is you can only want for yourself, not for anyone else. I\'ve gotten EVERYTHING I\'ve ever wanted so far in my life and I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth. The ONLY thing I want now and am willing to give up all else for is my son to be able to \"function\" without any assistance and communicate. But because of his neuro limitations, it just doesn\'t seem to work for him. He concentrates on what he wants now. He\'s a kid, so his priorities are fun ones. He wants to keep making those jump shots, play ball on the big boys team and climb on the highest rooftops (literally). And despite what they say about his motor \"problems\" (yeah, right-idiots) he can, he does and he will because he WANTS to. <br><br>One last piece of unwanted advice \"Be careful what you wish for\"!! Boy is that ever true.<br><br>If you choose to reply to this, I would like to know what are your roadblocks. I would love to help you as you have been helping me. I\'m great at this stuff, like you are great at figuring out the ASD mind stuff.<br><br>Now, I expect a wedding invitation, christening (or brisk, whatever) invitation, a housewarming party invitation and a Conrats on your new job party invitation with in the next 10 years!

'<P> I feel your concern, when my dd went to preschool for the first time and keep in mind this was spose to be a school that is used to working with kiddos like mine which is autism. She was 3 years old never done any sort of school. I went to find out that they would put her in a chair like that because they couldnt get her to sit for circle time. I am like what do you expect. You have to work at it. Some of these teacher just dont have patients for children like ours. Its like well have them be a helper during circle time. After that we no longer having her go to that school, we had more problems with them. My dd didnt even finish her first week there.</P> <P> I was told by a good friend, follow your gut feeling!! If you honestly can say to yourself it doesnt feel right then say this is not right and I do not approve and if they comply I would do pop visits just to make sure they are doing what you want them to do.</P> <P> There are different ways to get your child to slowly learn to sit for circle time. Like giving them a book of there own when its circle time to keep them sitting. But you actually have to work at it and not just throw them in a chair that they can not get out of. I honestly think those chairs are ment for severly handycap children so they can be on the same floor level as the other children, and someone thought it would be a great thing to stick our kids in them because its easier and they dont have to be distracted by the child. Sorry I could go on with this. It just breaks my heart and I feel your concern.</P> <P> Just remember do what your gutt says.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Never give up</div>'

He has been back to his angel boy status today. Whining was minimal and when I told him to do something (get upstairs, drink your juice, get your feet off the table). He did it w/out question.

Karate in the morning, fighting to keep my patience with my son because something was not right according to him, therapy at 3, more fighting to keep my patience.

He is on abilify 7mgs and 100mgs of topamax for his weight. The topamax has not helped his appetite at all and I am at my witts end with his weight. Believe you and me, this kid eats better than me. If I put the energy into my own diet the way that I do his, I am sure I would definitely loose a few pounds.</FONT></P> <P><FONT color=#9900cc size=3>I take him to the park 3-5 times a week, we take walks, plus he goes to karate 3 days a week. He has still managed to gain three pounds in the last 2 months. </FONT></P> <P><FONT color=#9900cc size=3>Despite all of the social activities, he is just innactive and I realize I cannot make him interact with other kids. He just refuses. He says the kids will tease him, call him slow, or that they don\'t like him. None of which I have ever heard. </FONT></P> <P><FONT color=#9900cc size=3>Whenever the kids do talk to him, he is either not paying attention to them or he just out right ignores them. On our way home from group therapy, he saw a kid from his school. In fact the kid recognized him first and spoke to him and he completely ignored him and started kicking a wall. This is a kid that he always talks about. He seems to admire this kid too. </FONT></P> <P><FONT color=#9900cc size=3>I am just so beat up right now. I know I am doing my best but my best never seems to be enough. I feel like I am never enough for my son. I feel like no matter what I do, it is never enough. I feel like I am his entire world. It gets so frustrating when he is trying to say something to me and I don\'t understand and believe you and me I kill myself to make sense of what he is saying. I dread asking him to repeat things because this becomes a knock down drag out war. He completely looses it. Going to the park is supposed to be a breath of fresh air but when we go, it is him complaining that he has no one to play with. I\'ve tried showing him how to play with the kids, standing near while he asks to play, telling him repeatedly to play, to just kicking a ball with him myself. Sometimes, he will get lucky and play with another child (rarely) but altimately, he his right by my side. He is getting to the point where he would prefer to stay in his room and watch Charlie and the Chocolate Factory all day if he could. I have to force him out to get air and excercise. </FONT></P> <P><FONT color=#9900cc size=3>This is not how I pictured my life with my son to be. I feel so cheated today by autism. God knows I love this child to death but I am just tired. </FONT></P> <P><FONT color=#9900cc size=3>Also, how can I be sure he is not Aspergers. Several psychiatrists have said no but I wonder if they are mistaken.</FONT></P> <P><FONT color=#9900cc size=6></FONT> </P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by leesita 125 on July 14 2007 at 7:05pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- leesita</div>'

'I would definitely give them (and the doctor once you get an appt.) the WHOLE list. You should ask how many \"standard deviations\" below normal your child is in each area. Ask what the criteria is for receiving services. Schools have to obey the law when it comes to giving services. That means, a child has to be a certain amount below normal before services can be given, legally. The schools MIGHT say you should check into getting an evaluation from a medical doctor to rule out or rule in autism. You can ask the school to pay for that medical evaluation. Around here, kids who are sent to the autism experts through the school district get bumped to the top of the waiting list. Actually, a medical diagnosis is not required in order to receive services. However, for your own peace of mind and also to help cut through red tape, you should get one. The schools can give your child the educational label of autism without the medical diagnosis but many are reluctant to take that step.'
'The nighttime stimming is a hard one. My son did it too and I used to tell him to be quiet, time for sleep. But mostly I tried to ignore it because I was too tired to intervene all the time. In the end we had to medicate him with Clonidine or he would be up till 1 am talking.<br> <br> He still talks at night and he is 13 now and verbal. But at least he falls asleep at a decent hour now, though I still have to tell him to be quiet on occasion. He talks so loud when he does it.<br> <br> Could you put in a solid core door on her room to block some of the noise so you can sleep?<br>'

'My son will be 5 in Aug and is NT (although has shown some things - now that we know what we are looking at from our dd). <br><br>Anyway, he has been day trained for about a year and a half, and night time is still a toss-up. He might be dry, he might not. <br><br>We limit his fluids in the afternoon/evening.<br><br>We bring him to pee before we go to bed around 10ish. <br><br>DH brings him to pee when he gets up for work around 5 - but sometimes he\'s already wet, or won\'t wake up enough to pee, then has an accident shortly after that.<br><br>It\'s so very frustrating, but we\'ve moved him completely out of pullups in the last couple of months, and we keep a plastic mattress cover under his sheets. <br><br>DS never, ever woke up dry while he was still 3 - not until well after he turned 4 did that ever start happening.

'<FONT size=1>I don\'t know how old your son is but my girl is 6 and started all that business a year or so ago. Mainly when she is tired or deep concentration like on the computer. I was bothered because of where she chose to do it. We started telling her that she needed to go to her room or to the restroom, that no one wanted to see her do that. I have always heard that it is normal \"exploring\" and to not make it negative, yada yada yada. So, that has worked for us because she doesn\'t usually choose to go elsewhere because she doesn\'t want to stop her main activity. So, in doing that, we don\'t make it negative, but it distracts.</FONT>'
