I find they come out best on 375 for about 30-35 mins on a baking stone lined w/ parchment paper.  Sometimes I turn off the oven and leave them in for another few minutes to dry out and become crisper.  You can puree a squash for mashed potatoes (maybe mix in some ckn broth) or you can cook cauliflower and then put it in a food processor w/ some salt, maybe some garlic.  Comes out pretty similar to mashers.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to Rosie, 7yrs - ASD Long Island, NY</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to Rosie, 7yrs - ASD Long Island, NY</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello, I started my son on this 2 weeks ago it was the one for $48.  In 2 weeks my sons language has improved, socialization has improved and stools improved within 3 days to being fully solid and he is going 2 times a day and wanting to eat often which before he had very little appetite.  The improvements started immediately and have slowly built as the days have gone by.  All his therapists have been so excited about the improvements they are seeing in him.  His preschool teachers have come to me the last few times excited about his improvements also.  Everyone is noticing them in such a short period of time.  Now for the negatives.  My son reacts to everything and this is no exception I was giving 1/2 capsule 2 times a day and he was not sleeping well at night, sometimes getting up 7 or 8 times and constantly wanting to drink and having a bellyache.  I have decreased it to 1/2 capsule in the morning and now he is sleeping most of the night.  Even at this small dose there have been improvements.  When I increase to 3/4 capsule he gets a terrible belly ache and I have to back off.  This product is well worth the money I think.  I have seen just as much improvement with this as I did with the cytoflora, my son just couldn\'t handle the cytoflora.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Caringdad71 and thank you for replying to my question in such detail. I have read your reply many times and think I understand what you are saying and I have also read the two articles you sent the links for.    At present, I give my daughter 100mg of SAMe every three days in order to help her methylation - I do not give it to her more often as I am trying to avoid a build up of homocysteine as you refer to in your post. Before, I was giving her 150gm of SAMe every day and while we saw good gains at first, after a few weeks she was somehow off. I am trying to avoid this happening again while at the same time trying to balance the amount fo SAMe so it won\'t build up.    You write that later on I can give her methionine to help support the \'long way\' of methylation and you also suggest adding DMG. Do you mean to stop SAMe and just give methionine and DMG  or  to  give SAMe and DMG together while slowly phasing out the SAMe? My daughter\'s last  organic acid test showed she had higher HVA relative to VMA. It seems to me that methylation is a very tricky subject!!!</div>'

Then again we are finally getting more agressive and perhaps smarter about controlling the yeast and Clostridia now (so maybe it was the Sac-B, etc).    Our typical schedule (after ramp up) is as follows:    [School days]    6AM - one threelac + one sac-B    after school - one Culturelle plus one Primal Defense Ultra    9PM  - one threelac + one sac-B or Culturelle  [wake him up if needed so ~2-3 hours after meals and other supplements]     [non-School days]    6AM - one threelac + one sac-B    11AM - one Culturelle plus one Primal Defense Ultra    ~3-3:30PM or pre-Dinner by 1 hour - one threelac + one sac-B    late day - Culturelle plus whatever    The Threelac is a lemony powder that he\'s fine with, and would probably be easier for a kid that can\'t swallow pills.

For instance if the glutathione is low then the whole cycle of how these supplements absord into the body can be thrown off according to Dr. Cave. MB-2, Glutathione, Folinic acid, DMG they all work in a cycle. If you\'re low in one it may block another from working right in the body.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Fuzzyone,  Well, I had wondered in the past about possible diabetes, but she was tested and they said it was not a problem.  It is only recently that I\'ve been considering hypoglycemia.  But I had not tied the &quot;seizure&quot; stuff to that, but only to the fact that she seem to need to eat often, and needs protein.  so I\'m really, really glad you suggested this.  I just got the Bock book in the mail today and he talks about the fact that hypoglycemia is a big issue in the 4-A kids.    I have been letting my dd eat a lot more carbs lately as I\'ve been trying to get some weight on her; I haven\'t been balancing the carbs and protein like I did for years here.  I am wondering if this has lead to the mood swings--and the &quot;seizure&quot; stuff I mentioned.  She is responsive, but is shaking all over, with her teeth chattering.  She says she gets something she calls &quot;scary tummy&quot; before this begins.  I had really thought maybe parasites.  Now this is interesting--I have treated many times for parasites, and the first two treatments helped, but I feel the last couple have maybe made her worse. So I have not treated her recently.  I am wondering tonight if the Vermox, which damages the parasites\' ability to use sugars, does something bad to my dd\'s sugar metabolism as well.  Hmmmm.....  Also wondering tonight if WD\'s &quot;trick&quot; of protein at night to help his son sleep might be due to normalization of blood sugar.  For the rest of my family, carbs at night help for sleep, as suggested by Sidney Baker (that\'s where we got it from, anyway.)  Maybe protein for my dd at night might help.  She is also a sleepwalker, up about 1-2 hours after she goes to sleep.  Thank you again--your suggestion was at just the right time for me to &quot;get it.&quot;  I\'m betting this will be the ticket!

' <div class=\"postbody\">It is unlikely that the COQ10 itself caused any problems as it is very poorly absorbed in a dry form (i.e. requires a lipid).    The chewable tablet is pretty much useless unless it consumed with a fatty meal.  It is better to buy COQ10 in a soft-gel (and cut it open if he cannot swallow) or a liposomal formula.

' <div class=\"postbody\">We use 5-HTP in combination with GABA and Melatonin in the evenings.  I give about 25 mg of 5-HTP to my 30 pound son.  It helps him stay asleep once he gets asleep (that\'s where the melatonin comes in).  We have seen no negatives from this supplement.  It\'s usually recommended that you be giving a B6 supplement along with 5-HTP.  If you give a carbohydrate snack with it, it seems to be better absorbed as well.      The only side effect may be hyperactivity.  If you see that, you probably do not want to use this supplement (since it is having the opposite effect that you would want).  This supplement is basically used to produce tryptophan (the stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy).      I think if you are using any prescription drugs that affect seratonin, you might not want to mess with this supplement either (or stop the Rx drugs during the trial) -- as tryptophan also regulates seratonin.    We use Jarrow brand 5-HTP.  This has worked well for us.  We give GABA 3 x per day, 250 mg per dose.  We do not use the GABA with Inositol as higher doses of inositol caused problems for us.  He gets a very small amount of inositol in his multi (Kirkman\'s Spectrum Complete).  We use Solgar brand GABA.    Taurine is also a very good supplement to promote calmness.  We use about 250 mg per day (also Solgar).</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I had to sit (for hours!) and spoonfeed my son for two years until he was well enough to broaden his diet on his own.  We began biomed at age 4 and I was still feeding him his meals (much to my parents\' horror) when he was six.  But he was not able to make himself eat it on his own.  I mean, REALLY not able.  \"Letting him get hungry enough to eat\" did NOT do the trick--he was at a place where he truly would starve before he\'d eat, and looked like a concentration camp victim.    Maybe your son won\'t eat because he can\'t, like my son.  You might consider working on other things at the same time--zinc, supplements (see the Reliv post above) and a parasite treatment (pinworm medication from the drug store.)  THat might make him feel better and be able to eat.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

To be honest, I wish I could use it more, because from what I have seen with my kiddo, it definitely has helped him, has never hurt him, and seems to clear him up of <em>something</em> within hours.    The only reason why I haven\'t been able to use it consistently is believe it or not - his school. It makes you pee a lot and the urine smells a tad bit, well, like chlorella. They were questioning it, which really pissed me off. Of course, we have the same problem with authia. I put it on him at night, the next morning I wiped the skin area where I applied it to, and didn\'t smell a thing. Lo and behold, the school writes a note stating that the smell from his vitamin cream is making others sick (it looks to me like they want my son to remain autistic forever! I am beginning to hate them! With good reason!).    I actually really like NDF. Especially right after a round of chelation - it seems to literally clean up what is lying around, helps to prevent re-distribution.    I never told our DAN! that we are using it - I just simply use it - and plan to use it more!    Sorry for the long post - Good Luck!</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Interesting the connection with smells ... Hydrogen sulfide (the smell of rotten eggs, putrid water, etc) is quite toxic and REEKS. As long as you can smell it, you\'re OK. But if you STOP smelling it ... you are about to pass out!!!     I used to work with samples in a lab containing lots of hydrogen sulfide. It was bad enough smelling it, but I knew that if I stopped perceiving the stench, I had to get out of there in a hurry ... or be carried out in a stretcher.     Although from what Dana says, it is the opposite way with DMPS. Dana, you have trouble when you smell it? I wonder if the first batch of DMPS was going bad, and you were smelling a byproduct (more stinky) of the DMPS that was affecting you? I know that over time, glutathione (also a sulfur compound) smells more and more ... it is becoming oxidized and less effective. Possibly the same happens to DMPS?

You really have to give it a good five or six weeks without any changes to get your base line.    After the first couple of weeks just ensure that you are providing proper supplementation.  We follow Dr. N\'s protocol.    With us, we really didn\'t have too many negatives.  There were some very early morning awakenings and oral stims were crazy.    We\'ve been doing MB12 for well over a year now.  We even stepped up to daily but honestly I didn\'t see that much more in the way of positives.  Basically now we are at least every other day.    My feeling is that it\'s something that is still contributing to my sons recovery.  He is doing very well.    Greg</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">LnAmon, I think AC actually mentions using EDTA if you\'ve chelated for at least a year to make sure mercury is out-if you are sure there\'s no more mercury, he does have a schedule for it and dosing if necessary, I think he still doesn\'t like recommending it, but if lead is a big problem, you may look into it. Honestly, you may have to take a break from all chelation for a bit. If he\'s getting sick, netrophils may be down and that\'s not good. Being sick alot is a sign of this. DMSA does pull lead, I\'d even consider once you\'ve had a break for a while, using DMSA again but with modified citrus pectin. There\'s a study on it and it\'s very effective at pulling lead specifically. I use it here at the end of a round. It went on to say that 500% of lead was being dumped after 7 days on MCP <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" /> . Pretty impressive.   I won\'t lie and say that I\'m not a bit concerned about going on to use EDTA. If it\'s the stall or sickness that is preventing progress, maybe take a break and see if he starts to feel better this summer and start again after some good sun exposure and he\'s not around so many kids at school. I will also say that I think suppositories can be traumatic for some kids. I still remember my mom doing it for me when I was 3. Autistics have so many strange feelings around their bodies and putting this in as often as required for chelation can cause regression, imo. But, I look at that kind of stuff alot for treating my kid. We don\'t even draw blood anymore.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Diane,  I just changed the twins to daybed style in their cribs with one of the sides gone and replaced it with a toddler bed siderail.  My girls also share a room and will wake the other one up if fussing etc.  My girls have also been good sleepers all along...and really nothing has messed with that much.  They now can get out of their beds and therefore have basically eliminated their naps except for about every 4th day.  They are still sleeping at night, but are very tired (maybe over tired)and sometimes wake up talking or slight fussing.  If your twins\' sleep issues are not due to the LDN...it could be the phasing out of naps or nightmares.  My older 4 all went through a nightmare or scared wakings at night around 3 years old...and they were not exposed to anything but videos I chose.  I think it is a normal phase for some kids especially when their imagination kicks in etc.  It could be normal.    On the other hand...I don\'t know what the half life of the LDN is...we are going to be starting it within the next several weeks or month.  But I understood it to affect the Circadian rhythms and I wonder if it could still affect the sleep/wake cycle after the med was no longer given for a while.  I really don\'t know.  I think it would be good to figure out though.  Maybe after the sleep issues subside - then I would try to reintroduce the LDN in tiny doses and if the same sleep issues occur...you have found your answer.  Hopefully as very tiny dose will give good results without many side effects...this stuff sure seems to be hard to regulate at first.    I know exactly what you mean about keeping the twins straight.  I actually have a chart that is in a 2 inch binder that has tabs for meds/supps, stools, food diaries, behavior changes etc...and I have to check off things as they happen or I give them - I made the charts on a spread sheet with the help of my friend...because if I had to write every single thing down everyday, I would go even loonier than I already am!!  You might want to try something like that.  For so long the girls were on the exact same things, but not really anymore...atleast not the same doses etc...so I have to keep it all straight!!!

Just start out gradually with 1 drop, then increase to 1 drop 3 times a day, then 2 drops 3 times a day - gradually increasing the doze.  Monitor your child\'s reaction.  Make sure you give NCD separate from vitamins and minerals. It can by put into liquid or food - doesn\'t have a taste or smell.  Very easy to use.  A doctor would usually order a Urine toxic metals test both pre and post-NCD, just to see how much metals it pulls out.  You can order this test yourself with Direct Laboratory Services.

He says that we need to take in higher levels like the Japanese.  These are high doses for instance the WHO recommends 1mg and from what I\'ve read Japanese women take in 12.5mg/day and have less breast &amp; uterine cancer.  I don\'t know if I can post his website for you to look at or not.  Anyways my research on iodine indicates that it chelates mercury, kills yeast and bacterias, stores in the body and bumps the junk out of the way so it can store its self there.  Iodine has also been associated with intelligence.  Everything I\'ve read says to be careful supplementing kids with Iodine.  Does anyone know why that is or have any experience in this area?  Of course he recommends thryoid monitoring and testing during use.  I\'m just wondering because the side effects of chelation sound scary, but this he\'s used with a lot of success in adults.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Thanks everyone for the info. I would like to know more about probiotics causing yeast also. I thought they were suppose to help control yeast.. So that is very confusing!

' <div class=\"postbody\">First of all, thanks all for your responses to my previous posts. I am very new to the biomedical world and may sound silly. We are now GF and trying CF and we just got our food panel results. I am confused.  Reference values of Alletess medical Labs &lt;0.199 ---------- 0 0.200-0.299------1 0.3-0.399--------2 &gt;0.400-----------3 0.185-0.215 should be considered equivocal  My DS got a 3 score in  Cow\'s milk Yogurt coconut  Got 1 score/equivocal in a few  others. Gluten 0 Wheat 1  He seems to have gotten 3 in those foods that he has most.  Have any of you used these results to guide  food elimination. We were going to go  CF anyway but were going to add coconut milk yogurt and coconut milk.. does coconut need  to be completely eliminated from his diet??  Please help!!!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ recovering a 2.5 yr DS with ASD</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ recovering a 2.5 yr DS with ASD</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Jen78fl,  I\'ve always been been awed and amazed by your dedication, perserverance, and willingness to try new things.  I remember how scared I was that my son talk much and being so frightened by the people who said if he didn\'t have therapy by age three and didn\'t talk by age five.......     I think they are often very wrong and there isn\'t a window or door that slams shut at five.  My son\'s progress didn\'t really start until 3 1/2 and really only took off between 4 1/2 and 5.    One of the kids at my son\'s preschool uses PECS sometimes, but he does talk.  When I was talking to his mom about how cool the PECS were, she said he didn\'t say a word or make  a sound until he was four.  He\'s five and he\'s enrolled in a regular preschool now.  It\'s going pretty well from what I can see.  I\'ll find out tommorow since he is coming to my house for a play date with S.    Have you tried PECS or sign language?  I also was going to suggest Leap Frog and baby bumble bee videos.    Liz</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">bump...  someone has got to have had some experiences with home test kits for food allergies?</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I think the probio defense and sac b are given after the bacteria is killed, to keep it away.   I would call the Doc right away and tell him you want a prescription medicine to kill the bacteria. And ask him to also use diflucan to kill the yeast. You can restart the Nystatin after the diflucan is gone.  ((hugs)) I am sorry he is struggling so.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ ~Blessed to be called Mama by many~</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ ~Blessed to be called Mama by many~</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">My daughter has one friend who also has some issues.  They get pretty much the same extra help in school.  When they are together sometimes they can play for hours and sometimes they argue.  I can pretty much stay out of that playdate, as they are at almost the same level.    When she plays with NT kids, I do intervene quite often.  The kids love to play with me too!      But when she is playing with her NT cousins, I can let her be because they love her for who she is.    Dee\'s mom</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi all. Well I just ordered a 1 month supply of DMSA suppositories and a 1 month supply of LDN cream for a total of $105 plus $25 for overnight shipping of the supps...  I am planning on submitting a claim to insurance but I am wondering what you all put as the reason for needing these medications.. I am thinking metal toxicity for the suppositories and immune system dysfunction for the LDN cream but I am not sure if this is good or not... Just wanted to get some opinions on what would be best.... I was reimbursed some for MB12 shots when we did those but not for glutathione cream, so I guess you never know what they are going to pay for.. I appreciate any advice on this. Thanks!

' <div class=\"postbody\">Although my son takes enzymes for the gluten and casein, I am thinking that he needs to control the yeast better. We have used Dulflucan, which improved his poop, but once he stopped taking it, they went back to the mushy-ness that they were before. I am going to talk to my Dan doc about taking this, but was wondering how other\'s feel about it? How much do you take and how long do you take it for? How do you know if you\'ve gotten all the yeast?</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Vanessa    We are not given more than we can handle.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Vanessa    We are not given more than we can handle.</div>'
