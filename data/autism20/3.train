' <div class=\"postbody\">It\' is going very bad with the K teacher since day 1, my child comes crying everyday because of the difference in the treatment. He is aware that teacher prefers certain kids to others. We are immigrants and the teacher is a little bit not very tolerant, she prefers blond blue eyes kids. He thinks its the norm because of the previous pre-k bad experience. I know that teachers will not go against each other for a child. Please note that the child is extremely bright academically and way above K level. I don\'t want my child to have a low self esteem and feel inferior. Last week a parent pulled their daughter from the class but went to another school (also immigrants).  What solutions do I have? He doesn\'t want to be homeschooled. He loves people.  Thank you for your help</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello, I am new to this site.  I am not sure if my daughter has autism or not but either way, she does have a \"stim.\"      I always thought her finger wiggling was a habbit.  I never thought much of it, although I always found it to be odd looking.  I just assumed she would outgrow it.  She is four now.      My question is, will it ever go away?  I am new to the idea she may have autism and to be honest I am feeling a bit overwhelmed.  Before I realized what she was doing was not a habbit, I tried to get her to stop.  She was able to stop at that moment without any problems however just a few hours later, she would be doing it again.      Does anyone have advise on what I can do for her?  Do your children stim?  Do they drift off at a certain age?  Do I just need to let her do it?     I am so confused and sad I was pushing her to stop when she couldnt control herself.  Any advise would really help me out.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">We use time-out because it works for Spencer.  At home, he has to go to his room for time-out for about 4-5 minutes when he does something he knows he shouldn\'t (ex. sit on the cat).      A lot of times, I can ask him \"do you want to go to time-out?\" when I see him about to do something he shouldn\'t.  Most of the time he\'ll reply \"no\" and stop doing it.  Key word being MOST!!    When I go to get him out, I always ask him if he knows why he got put in time-out.  I guess I want to be sure he understands what he did wrong.  He usually knows what he did and says it.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to Hannah, 11 NT and Spencer, 7 PDD-NOS and ADHD</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to Hannah, 11 NT and Spencer, 7 PDD-NOS and ADHD</div>'

However, they are seperate disorders. Many children (most? all? I\'m not really sure about this) with autism have SPD but not all people with SPD are autistic. SPD can often be seen alongside other developmental disorders and it can also exist on it\'s own with no other issues.  Dana has posted some fantastic sensory resources and links. Check in the reference section. Also, if this is an avenue you are exploring, I would highly recommend, <strong>The Out-of-Sync Child: Recognizing and Coping with Sensory Integration Dysfunction</strong>, by Carol Stock Kranowitz  I found it to be invaluable in helping me to recognize SPD in my son.

' <div class=\"postbody\">It\'s really nice to read that parents on the site have children who have had very positive Montessori experiences. I was in Montessori education full-time for years, and now work one-one with children with autism.     I have some thoughts to share that might help a lot of children, parents, and teachers.    While Montessori really lends itself to special needs and sensory issues, the teachers are like I was before I had exposure to the subject of autism and other conditions. It\'s great that a good teacher usually tunes into each child individually, and \"gets\" what a child is experiencing.     Montessori teachers ASSUME that no one child is going to be like another. Montessori teachers see it is their job to support the child by working well with parents, who are of course the first and will always be the most important teachers for any child. This is how they are trained. But they are usually not trained to work with children with special needs, per se, nor how to talk with parents about their observations when a child presents with behavior or learning differences. This is an aside...but Montessori is such a multi-sensory experience, that a child with auditory processing or other difficulties can often have his or her issues go unnoticed for longer because of the visual, non-verbal, and kinesthetic aspects of the whole experienced. (longer than would be the case in a traditional preschool.)    Parents who are involved with Montessori might consider making presentations at staff meetings as teachers are hungry for first-hand information from those they truly respect - the parents! Or, even if you\'re not involved with a school, most Montessori schools would welcome a parent with insights and first-hand experiences about ASD issues.    Right now there are a few children who have definite behavior and learning issues at the school I enjoy subbing at (between the 10 day AIT sessions that I hold). These children who could strongly benefit from OT and other interventions, though I am not surely not qualified to say how they would be assessed if evaluated. There are definitie sensory and communication challenges there also.    Neither parents nor teachers are usually informed about special needs issues and the potential that can come from early intervention. When teachers believe there are issues that need to be looked into, and understand the benefits of early diagnosis, they can be really \"up against it\" when they broach the subject with parents. Two out of three parents seem to remove a child from school rather than get an evaluation for a 2 or 3 year-old. Teachers and school admin may need some help from parents so staff can talk to parents in ways that can be heard.     Knowing now what I\'ve learned from parents, children, and other trainings, I\'d have both a way for parents to train teachers AND a parent support group within the school to offer help, support, and information to other parents.     If a child\'s doctor doesn\'t think there is an issue, which is so often the case, it\'s only natural that parents wait until they\'ve heard concerns from more than just 1 teacher or school. It can be such a hard bridge to cross to go from \"my child is doing fine\" to \"perhaps my child has special needs and requires some new opportunities\"...or \"my child has autism.\"    It would be so much more in the service of children if children could stay in this environment that serves them so well AND recieve the necessary interventions - and if parents could recieve more support around investigating these matters.    All this is not to say that sometimes Montessori doesn\'t offer the small groups and structure needed for kids on the spectrum. But many children can manage wonderfully once their sensory issues and other challenges are addressed adequately.    Jennifer</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">(inspired by LMP\'s canvas post)    What do you usually give your children\'s teachers for the Holidays? And how many gifts do you give out? What about the aides?  I used to give something to everybody who worked with my son, but this year due to the rotating aides at school, plus the outside folks it\'s a little crowd- we don\'t have any family around, so it\'s OK, I\'ll be shopping for therapists  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /> - it\'s not like they don\'t deserve it. I am just so un-creative and have a hard time coming up with ideas.  A little craft where I could involve Alex as well would be good too. I will definitely have him write out cards to everybody, since his handwriting has improved to semi-legibility.  Are gift certificates considered too impersonal?     Any thoughts?

' <div class=\"postbody\">Your son sounds much like mine.  A distressed birth.  The nerve not developing properly is also like mine--we have found out that it is likely due to a systemic mold infection. The thought is that antibiotics early in life wiped out the good flora in his gut, and a mold infection, we think from the home we lived in, got a good foothold.  He is deaf in one ear.    I would consider getting your doctor to prescribe nystatin, and take it for a month.  It is non-toxic and does not leave the bowel.  It will probably really help gut issues also; we take a probiotic between doses of nystatin daily.  My son is 12 and in managed recovery.  After doing all this for almost 10 years now, I look back and antifungals are the thing that helped him the most over the years, but we did not really understand this (or why!) at the time.  We would do a round (15 days) of nystatin or diflucan, he\'d do really great, and then we\'d begin the gradual backslide.  If antifungals work, you need to stay on them as you work to heal the gut.  Also if you get a really good response to antifungals, you might consider consulting a toxicologist or environmental medicine specialist instead of a DAN.  This is what I wish I\'d done; didn\'t know any better then, but I do now.  Good luck!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'
