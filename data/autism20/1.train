'<P><strong><FONT color=#990066 size=4>boobear-</FONT></strong></P> <P><strong><FONT color=#990066 size=4>Benadryl is an antihistamine used for allergies or to help sleep. I used it to help me sleep. I became quite \"addicted\" to it and had a hard time getting off. It\'s not an \"addictive\" drug, but I guess it was for me. Here are it\'s uses:</FONT></strong></P> <P><strong>PRESCRIBED FOR:</strong> Diphenhydramine is used for the relief of nasal and non-nasal symptoms of various allergic conditions such as seasonal allergic rhinitis. It is also used to treat patients with chronic urticaria. Although antihistamines are the preferred class of drugs in allergic rhinitis, they only reduce symptoms by 40-60%. Diphenhydramine also is used for allergic reactions involving the eyes (allergic conjunctivitis), to prevent or treat active <A href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/&#115;cript/main/art.asp?articlekey=9485\" target=\"_blank\"><FONT color=#0033cc>motion sickness</FONT></A>, and for mild cases of Parkinsonism, including drug-induced Parkinsonism. The last two uses (motion sickness and Parkinsonism) are based on the anticholinergic effects of diphenhydramine, and not its antihistamine effects. Diphenhydramine also is used as an aid for insomnia.</P> <P><strong><FONT color=#990099 size=4>I found this too!! I feel better!</FONT></strong></P> <P><B>PREGNANCY:</B> Diphenhydramine has been used extensively in pregnant women; the incidence of fetal malformations is the same as that which would be expected in women who are not taking medications. Additionally, studies in animals suggest no important effects on the fetus. Diphenhydramine, therefore, can be used in pregnancy if the physician feels that it is needed. </P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Holly_WA on July 04 2007 at 7:07pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- http://themeluginmonkeys.blogspot.com    Holly-mom to:    DH-David-Aspergers  Sarah-14y Anxiety  Rachel-13y Severe anxiety, Bipolar, ADD, LD\'s, CAPD  Jacob-9y HFA, anxiety, ADHD  Anna-7y anxiety???</div>'

'I think you\'re right to worry! Even a service dog still needs exercise, <br />training, grooming, feeding, and to have it\'s poop scooped!!! <br /> <br />The first thing to ask yourself, other than whether you\'re ready for all the <br />responsiilities that come with dog ownership, is what specific function <br />you\'re hoping the dog will fulfill with your daughter. <br /> <br />If you\'re wanting a dog to prevent your child from wandering, or find your <br />child should she wander off, you\'ll need a specially trained dog from a <br />major service dog organization. <br /> <br />If you\'re wanting a dog as a companion to your child, who will be her best <br />friend and help engage her, draw her out of herself, and give her a sense <br />of responsibility and self-esteem, then, provided your daughter actually <br /><em>likes</em> dogs, any old mutt will do! <br /> <br />We have three dogs, all rescues, and they\'re great for Donny. They\'ve <br />been good in teaching boundaries/appropriate behaviour around animals, <br />and in getting him to engage with another in a forceful, intentional, direct <br />manner. Dogs don\'t respond to \"sit\", when it\'s said from 5 feet away in a <br />sing-song voice by someone who\'s not looking at them - Donny\'s having <br />to learn to get eye contact, face the animal, stand tall, and firmly say \"sit\", <br />while using the hand signal. It\'s worth it to him, as he finds it very <br />rewarding when an animal responds to his directive. Donny also <br />practices following directions around making their food, putting it down, <br />putting a leash and collar on them, walking them, etc. <br /> <br />He absolutely LOVES our one little dog, and she\'s fantastic at cheering <br />him up when he\'s cranky - she would be considered a \"therapy dog\" I <br />think. <br /> <br />That said, I don\'t leave the dogs alone with Donny, he\'s not allowed to <br />walk them by himself. HE is too unpredictable, and dogs are only dogs <br />afterall! There\'s still a good amount of time where he\'s not appropriate <br />with them. He has a hard time understanding that they don\'t understand <br />screeching gibberish mixed with the words \"go away!\", shoving hands, <br />and nervous giggling. We\'re always talking about being nice to the dogs, <br />and if he doesn\'t want them near, either sit on a piece of furniture, or be <br />in his room (he tends to go lay on the floor by a dog, flop around, then <br />get grouchy when the dog gets excited and tries to lick him and play). <br /> <br />Also, breed does NOT matter. If you get a dog, choose a dog based on <br />what your family needs. If you\'re strapped for time already, I\'d choose a <br />sturdy, short-coated breed that can do without a ton of exercise. <br />However, know even the most low-maintenance dog is still going to need, <br />at the very least, a daily walk and two 10-15 minute training sessions per <br />day.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Donny 13 - classic autism, bipolar</div>'

'<FONT face=\"Courier New, Courier, mono\">It\'s interesting you mentioned the scattering toys thing lowbudgetdave. Aiden did that too. He did do lining up things at one point but after he\'d line balls up all along the liv room wall he\'d stand and look at it for awhile then walk over and with his hands start flipping them away from wall and scattering them. He\'d mess up things in his room too and seemed to like to put things in order so he could mess them up. It was always strange and he\'d do it for hours. I hadn\'t hear of other kids really doing scattering toys I always heard of just lining up or spinning or stacking. Aiden did do stacking as well though. I enjoyed reading this post to see some of what other people have experienced compared to my own. It\'s been interesting.
