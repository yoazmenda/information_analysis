' <div class=\"postbody\">I make butternut squash fries - peel the squash, slice it up like fries, mix w/ a little olive oil just to coat.  I find they come out best on 375 for about 30-35 mins on a baking stone lined w/ parchment paper.  Sometimes I turn off the oven and leave them in for another few minutes to dry out and become crisper.  You can puree a squash for mashed potatoes (maybe mix in some ckn broth) or you can cook cauliflower and then put it in a food processor w/ some salt, maybe some garlic.  Comes out pretty similar to mashers.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to Rosie, 7yrs - ASD Long Island, NY</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to Rosie, 7yrs - ASD Long Island, NY</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello, I started my son on this 2 weeks ago it was the one for $48.  In 2 weeks my sons language has improved, socialization has improved and stools improved within 3 days to being fully solid and he is going 2 times a day and wanting to eat often which before he had very little appetite.  The improvements started immediately and have slowly built as the days have gone by.  All his therapists have been so excited about the improvements they are seeing in him.  His preschool teachers have come to me the last few times excited about his improvements also.  Everyone is noticing them in such a short period of time.  Now for the negatives.  My son reacts to everything and this is no exception I was giving 1/2 capsule 2 times a day and he was not sleeping well at night, sometimes getting up 7 or 8 times and constantly wanting to drink and having a bellyache.  I have decreased it to 1/2 capsule in the morning and now he is sleeping most of the night.  Even at this small dose there have been improvements.  When I increase to 3/4 capsule he gets a terrible belly ache and I have to back off.  This product is well worth the money I think.  I have seen just as much improvement with this as I did with the cytoflora, my son just couldn\'t handle the cytoflora.</div>'

The day after those dreams is so rough on me, thank goodness I very rarely have them.  But then today he reminded me why I probably had that dream, because he is getting more and more vocal.  Today I talked to him in the car after school, I asked him if he had a good day and he replied, \"Gugh\".  Then he opened his lunchbox to finish the remaining food and he said, \"eat\".    So, maybe the dream is some sort of sign now, and not some sort of fantasy that is unattainable.</div>    maybe this dream was telling you it was about to happen and not to give up given your post on speech, even as hokey as it sounds. i wish i was able to dream since i lost my thyroid function i dont dream well i dont remember them anyway but on melatonin i did so perhaps i am really as messed up as my kid haha. i am going to try myself the tyrosine you suggested after reading the description of it from your link thanks, i have said before it pays to read all posts as something might come up that pertains to what you are looking for. again congrats on the words.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Lisalynn  keeping hope and faith through it all.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Lisalynn  keeping hope and faith through it all.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Caringdad71 and thank you for replying to my question in such detail. I have read your reply many times and think I understand what you are saying and I have also read the two articles you sent the links for.    At present, I give my daughter 100mg of SAMe every three days in order to help her methylation - I do not give it to her more often as I am trying to avoid a build up of homocysteine as you refer to in your post. Before, I was giving her 150gm of SAMe every day and while we saw good gains at first, after a few weeks she was somehow off. I am trying to avoid this happening again while at the same time trying to balance the amount fo SAMe so it won\'t build up.    You write that later on I can give her methionine to help support the \'long way\' of methylation and you also suggest adding DMG. Do you mean to stop SAMe and just give methionine and DMG  or  to  give SAMe and DMG together while slowly phasing out the SAMe? My daughter\'s last  organic acid test showed she had higher HVA relative to VMA. It seems to me that methylation is a very tricky subject!!!</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Ness 601 was the first thing that Maile got Luke to take, I saw results within 2 days, less constipation and his stomach looked less swollen too.  It was a B**ch to get ahold of though, now I have enough of it to last about a year!  Argentyn is amazing, Luke hasn\'t been sick since he started taking it, he gets alittle snotty nose, and boom it\'s gone in a few days, he used to have a constant runny nose before.  I use it on cuts and scrapes and cold sores too, I apply it directly to the affected area and it scabs over and heals in about 1/4 of the usual time.  hang in there, it will get better.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I started my son on Valtrex yesterday, so far no bad side effects other than he seems to be stimming quite a bit.  He also seems a little on the hyper side.  Grace, your Valtrex thread is wonderful!!  Thanks also for the info about low oxalates, I\'m trying to follow that as well.  Thankfully my son really likes many low oxalate food items, whew!!      Tracey, good luck with the Valtrex!!!  It\'s so scary starting something new, not knowing what will happen.  I have always noticed that with every regression comes an increase in developmental growth.  The regression is so hard to get through but when you keep thinkng about the upcoming growth, it\'s a little easier to deal with.      Jennifer</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">most products that are safe for our kids say it on the bottle.  \"hypoallergenic\" or \"free of common allergens: gluten, casein, soy, corn, wheat, starches, fillers,\" etc.      My theory is if it doesn\'t say it\'s free of stuff, it may be in there.

' <div class=\"postbody\">We\'re still using it.  I\'ve kept DS on 50 mg in the morning only - anything more than that causes sleeplessness, so I haven\'t had the energy to increase it any.  He does seem to be more attentive on it.  It\'s not dramatic, but any improvement is good, and it\'s a great antioxidant, so I figure it\'s not going to hurt him.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to one 4-yr-old boy, dx w/Asperger\'s</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to one 4-yr-old boy, dx w/Asperger\'s</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Terese,    We started using Threelac 3-4 weeks ago.  The yeast die-off that we saw this past week was the first pronounced one that we\'ve seen, and pretty intense.  Then again we are finally getting more agressive and perhaps smarter about controlling the yeast and Clostridia now (so maybe it was the Sac-B, etc).    Our typical schedule (after ramp up) is as follows:    [School days]    6AM - one threelac + one sac-B    after school - one Culturelle plus one Primal Defense Ultra    9PM  - one threelac + one sac-B or Culturelle  [wake him up if needed so ~2-3 hours after meals and other supplements]     [non-School days]    6AM - one threelac + one sac-B    11AM - one Culturelle plus one Primal Defense Ultra    ~3-3:30PM or pre-Dinner by 1 hour - one threelac + one sac-B    late day - Culturelle plus whatever    The Threelac is a lemony powder that he\'s fine with, and would probably be easier for a kid that can\'t swallow pills.    Hope that this helps your decision.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Interesting!  DS and I both have knock knees too, and I had a mild stutter/stammer as a child - still shows up if I\'m really tired.  Oddly enough, DH is slightly bow-legged, and he\'s never had a speech problem <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />  I do know that DS and I both tested low in vit D, and DS tested low in vit C also.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Some people don\'t really see a change unless other supplements are added. For instance if the glutathione is low then the whole cycle of how these supplements absord into the body can be thrown off according to Dr. Cave. MB-2, Glutathione, Folinic acid, DMG they all work in a cycle. If you\'re low in one it may block another from working right in the body. It\'s all confusing to me but Sasha is low so I know he needs it to be able to detox more junk in his body.   -Crystal</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I\'ve used both, it just depended on what we were in need of, what we wanted in an enzyme.  I had a lot of success with the Kirkman\'s, even after an infraction, I\'d give an enzyme and it worked almost as well as activated charcoal.  Houston is fantastic too, and they were great for sending to school since he would take the chewables without a fight.      I think this is the first time my son is the opposite of Gavin Tami!!!  For us, Kirkman worked best when he had severe gut issues and the Houston worked best once he was healing.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Dana</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Dana</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Fuzzyone,  Well, I had wondered in the past about possible diabetes, but she was tested and they said it was not a problem.  It is only recently that I\'ve been considering hypoglycemia.  But I had not tied the &quot;seizure&quot; stuff to that, but only to the fact that she seem to need to eat often, and needs protein.  so I\'m really, really glad you suggested this.  I just got the Bock book in the mail today and he talks about the fact that hypoglycemia is a big issue in the 4-A kids.    I have been letting my dd eat a lot more carbs lately as I\'ve been trying to get some weight on her; I haven\'t been balancing the carbs and protein like I did for years here.  I am wondering if this has lead to the mood swings--and the &quot;seizure&quot; stuff I mentioned.  She is responsive, but is shaking all over, with her teeth chattering.  She says she gets something she calls &quot;scary tummy&quot; before this begins.  I had really thought maybe parasites.  Now this is interesting--I have treated many times for parasites, and the first two treatments helped, but I feel the last couple have maybe made her worse. So I have not treated her recently.  I am wondering tonight if the Vermox, which damages the parasites\' ability to use sugars, does something bad to my dd\'s sugar metabolism as well.  Hmmmm.....  Also wondering tonight if WD\'s &quot;trick&quot; of protein at night to help his son sleep might be due to normalization of blood sugar.  For the rest of my family, carbs at night help for sleep, as suggested by Sidney Baker (that\'s where we got it from, anyway.)  Maybe protein for my dd at night might help.  She is also a sleepwalker, up about 1-2 hours after she goes to sleep.  Thank you again--your suggestion was at just the right time for me to &quot;get it.&quot;  I\'m betting this will be the ticket!  I\'ll post and let you know!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'
