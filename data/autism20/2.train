'jonsdfca -What size class did your son have in preschool? If his preschool IEP requires a smaller class size, they have to explain (in writing if you request) why they have upped his class size. In term of benefit to him, not in terms of whether or not they have an appropriate class in the school. They must FIND an appropriate class if putting him in the kindergarten with the all the kids is not \"reasonably calculated\" to enable him to make \"more than trivial progress.\" This is what the law says. If you believe he will not progress at all in his proposed placement, you can go to Due Process and make a case that the District is setting him up to fail. Read your Due Process Rights - the school MUST give every parent at copy at least once a year.'

I haven\'t really settled down much mostly because I need the fresh start over and over. I currently have 3 nearly separate lives in 3 separate towns (although thankfully, one of them wil be coming to a close at the end of this month). One of the bands I played with (of which my brother was also a member as a drummer) did do fairly well locally, playing gigs on and off for about 2 years. We broke up when our frontman decided to go solo, essentially ditching us in the process. <br /> <br />I do get taken advantage of and misunderstood a lot on the job, and that\'s one reason why I have never kept any one job more than about 2 years. This school-teaching experience that I\'m dealing with right now has been absolutely horrendous for me from all aspects, and I have been in almost continuous overload for the past 3 months. My separate lives in my hometown (where my family lives), and my college town (where I have some close friends), serve as escapes for me on weekends and scheduled breaks. I will leave teaching behind in less than a week, and focus solely on my other 2 \"lives.\" I will seek to find employment and stability in one place, while using the other as an escape and a crutch. I\'m not yet sure which town will fill which role, though. After I\'ve had a few weeks to recover emotionally, I will proceed to figure that one out.<span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by stickboy26 on May 25 2007 at 9:21am</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>-   ~Nick   Still in touch with my inner child ;)</div>'

'Niki, <br />My son is in Kindergarten and he will turn 6 on Sunday. He is not the <br />oldest one in that class by the way. He is only in a half day Kindergarten <br />and believe me he has been in an intense ABA program for some time. <br />He still is getting used to the demands that are placed upon him at <br />school. He has to process everyting so much faster. Its pretty fast paced. <br />I have noticed a lot more inattentiveness and zoning out. We are <br />tweaking his home program a bit to get him used to the pace of school <br />and all the distractions that it entails. Without the supports that my son <br />gets, I think he too would be a mess. My child needs a little time to get <br />used to change/demands and also he needs to be successful or I know he <br />will shut down. <br /> <br />Yes I would be worried about the lost time and lost learning oppurtunity <br />for yr Mason. I really think that you may look into an advocate. He needs <br />some more proactive supports. I think he is regressing at school and <br />they do not know what to do with him. An expert on autism education <br />and behavior is what you need. I do hope you get some help soon.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to ds age 17/nt   dd age 14/nt   ds age 6/asd</div>'
'<P>My son will be entering kindergarten in the fall. He is currently in the school district\'s integrated preschool and we do ABA at home.<EM> </EM></P> <P>We have decided to do partial mainstreaming for kindy. He will attend the regular classroom for circle time, recess, and specials (art, music, gym, etc) and this class will be his \"homeroom\". He will spend the rest of the time in the autism classroom. Our school district does not use ABA in the classroom. Instead, the autism classroom uses a system based on the TEACCH method. While we love the ABA work we have done at home, and we know that our son has made great progress because of ABA, he does seem to have developed some issues of prompt dependence as a result. After meeting with the teacher and staff, we are excited about the methods used in this classroom, since they will work on helping him learn more self-initiative and independence. We also are happy that he will have the chance to interact with his typical peers. </P> <P> </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Gena  DS 5 yrs ASD with Hyperlexia & Dyspraxia and Albinism</div>'

'Sorry to say that I have been working for 10 years with our own SD about getting paras trained. The above info will get you what training your para has, but it does not guarantee that you\'ll get a para WITH TRAINING. That you have to fight your district for. In our district, one of the issues is the Union. Too long to get into, but sometimes rules from one world clash with rules from another world. Good luck.'

'<P>My son, who is 4.5, has again tested with a high IQ during his evaluation this week (thanks to lots of ABA, I suspect!) We are preparing for his transition to Kindergarten. The psychologist said that she wouldn\'t be administering a Vineland to him because it is for MR issues. However, I think it could be useful to have it in his file to document his adaptive issues. I am guessing we will see a big discrepancy between his IQ and his Vineland scores. What do you think? I am concerned the SD might try to declassify him or give him a 504 instead of an IEP. </P> <P>I was also told that the OT would probably not be doing a Sensory Profile of my son, which makes no sense. I did request these tests. Don\'t we have the right to have them done? Thanks!</P>'

'<P>I agree KathyK! The ASD teacher didn\'t realize that she was pulling ds out for the \"switch-out\" time - which they vary between social studies and science. She thought he was just missing rest time. When I pointed this out, she talked to the teacher and we came up with a different solution, which I hope works. I don\'t want him missing academics and his teacher totally agreed. My goal is to keep him in the mainstream classroom for as long as he can handle. I want the resource room to be a safe place he can go if he needs a short break, but I want him to graduate with a diploma if possible! </P> <P>I know I\'m sounding anal - especially since ds is in kindergarten. But, I don\'t want to start out with him being pulled out more than necessary. The ASD teacher agreed and is in full support of him staying in the classroom for almost all of the day. He needs a couple of short breaks and needs to finish his lunch during the class\' rest time - that is it for now. We will adjust as academics get harder and the pressures increase. But, I want him doing as much as he is capable of in the mainstream classroom as much as possible.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS (9 yo) diagnosed with mild PDD-NOS and DD (6 yo) NT - but definitely a challenge!</div>'
