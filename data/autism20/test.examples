'<P>Technically he is not diagnosed yet with any form autism. Our neurologist (and our OT ST and Ed teacher) all believe if he is autistic he is very mild. That is why I have not pushed for a diagnosis (plus I get services without the dx). We do lots of things at home, including some ABA type things. I work in a school where they are ABA classes and I am familiar with some of the techniques. I will push for as much as we can get, keeping in mind he is still young and is getting tons of other services (OT, ST, ED, CST), as well. </P> <P> </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Monica  J 6 NT  O 4.5 ?

' <div class=\"postbody\">oops--the page I found the chiropractor\'s book on was the &quot;no wheat&quot; page by Linda Blanchard.

'<P>Marcela,</P> <P> Welcome to the Forum. It seems like the state you are leaving has better public school programs than the one you are moving to. Having said that in the private sector as far as opportunitities for more up to date programs, if you are in or close to Atlanta you will have the Emory autism program. There is an RDI center there as well as some other ABA programs. Goodluck.</P> <P>Concernedpa.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to DS (2001)diagnosis:ASD</div>'

'<P>I actually respectfully disagree IBGECKO. ODD is often a comorbid disorder with HFA/AS. ODD is oppositional defiant disorder in case anyone is wondering.</P> <P>I think it would be a very wise idea to get him checked out by a developmental pediatrician (these docs have an additional 2 years of training in developmental issues past their pediatric training) and/or a pediatric neuropsychologist. Rages/tantrums are not uncommon among kids on the spectrum. I personally feel that ODD is just a part of some kids\' autism spectrum disorder and I know there are others that agree with me.</P> <P>I\'m not qualified to diagnose either - especially without seeing your child. However, the sensory issues, lack of eye contact, playing better with younger children, difficutly with expressive language and inappropriate expression of emotions are hallmarks of being on the spectrum. But again, you need to see a professional to really make sure. I would ask around and see who the best person to see is - not all professionals are created equal! <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley2.gif\" border=\"0\"> You might check at your local ARC agency and/or an autism/Asperger\'s support group. Parents of kids on the spectrum are the best resource for finding out who to see - they have fought hard to get what they have and usually are VERY willing to help those coming after them! If you get a diagnosis - I hope you and everyone else does the same!</P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by snoopywoman on July 12 2006 at 7:17am</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS (9 yo) diagnosed with mild PDD-NOS and DD (6 yo) NT - but definitely a challenge!</div>'
'Have you visited the classroom they are proposing putting him in? I would do that before I\'d agree to any placement. Of course, you\'ll have to remember that the kids you\'re seeing today are a year older than your son is now, but seeing a placement is the best way to know what possible issues will be. He may need a consultant to come in to bring the teacher and staff up to speed on his issues. He may need a one-on-one aide. He may not need much of anything. Seeing what the situation is will help you understand what he WILL need.'

'<P>Hi thanks for your reply</P> <P>Can I ask you if their were many physically disabled children inyour special school, and if so how this made you feel, obviously as adultd we understand , but my worry is that billy going into a class with children who are physically disabled , will make his confidence about himself lower, I hope you don,t think I am being silly .</P>'
'I would also ask them what time of day does your son ask to go?<br>Take note at home what time of day his usually poop time?<br><br>This will also guide the teacher to know that is his time and with that many adults in the classroom there is no reason for them not to give him the time he needs. Kids aren\'t robots...heck I can\'t just pop a squat and go our bodies just don\'t work that way.<br><br>I don\'t know if this really needs to be a goal in the IEP, but it should be something addressed in the classroom as far as an accommodation. My son Jesse didn\'t get trained until age 4. The year before he was in the pre primary impaired classroom and we had 1 teacher and 2 aides. I never put him in pullups, he never pooped at school either. They worked with ALL the kids on potty training and luckily he hardly ever had an accident. There were certain times of the morning that they would all have their time in the potty and everyone got a sticker on the chart as if they were at home. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- ~Melissa  SAHM of 4  Matthew (13)-ADHD  Jesse (11)-Aspergers  Gabriel (7 1/2) ADHD possibly Autistic  Emma (6) High strung like mom.rofl</div>'

'Yeah, I still haven\'t checked with the school if ds can bring a plastic knife - I keep forgetting to do that. But, he often has problems getting a banana open and I would like to be able to send one with him. But, I don\'t want him struggling with it for five of the 15-20 minutes they are allowed to eat!

'<P>Notime I pm\'d you back, my email is <A href=\"mailto:kerishea@opt&#111;nline.net\" target=\"_blank\">kerishea@optonline.net</A> if you want to write more I usually check that more than this board. I feel for you at that school. I left for many reason and only provide home care now, its much better than the stress I dealt with and no one understadning why things had to be done a certain way there. Administration had thier own crazy rules and it wasnt the way a teacher would do things. For example, bulletin boards are more important that having personal schedules for each child. Sorry to rip on a school but when you are behind the doors and see stuff and you know how stuff is being done its better to let people know.</P>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Dani~    We have done the TD-DMPS every other day ~ also 3 on 11 off,  TD-DMSA 3 on 11 off,  3 on 4 off and in between there.  We now do IV 1 x month.  From what I have learned from all of this in doing it and talking to others is every kid is different and every chelator is different on their body.  When we did TD, for my son 3 on 11 off worked best for him.   I really think you have to play around with the protocols to see which is best for your child.    Hope this helps and Good luck!</div>'
