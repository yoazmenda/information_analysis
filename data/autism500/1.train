Here are it\'s uses:</FONT></strong></P> <P><strong>PRESCRIBED FOR:</strong> Diphenhydramine is used for the relief of nasal and non-nasal symptoms of various allergic conditions such as seasonal allergic rhinitis. It is also used to treat patients with chronic urticaria. Although antihistamines are the preferred class of drugs in allergic rhinitis, they only reduce symptoms by 40-60%. Diphenhydramine also is used for allergic reactions involving the eyes (allergic conjunctivitis), to prevent or treat active <A href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/&#115;cript/main/art.asp?articlekey=9485\" target=\"_blank\"><FONT color=#0033cc>motion sickness</FONT></A>, and for mild cases of Parkinsonism, including drug-induced Parkinsonism. The last two uses (motion sickness and Parkinsonism) are based on the anticholinergic effects of diphenhydramine, and not its antihistamine effects. Diphenhydramine also is used as an aid for insomnia.</P> <P><strong><FONT color=#990099 size=4>I found this too!! I feel better!</FONT></strong></P> <P><B>PREGNANCY:</B> Diphenhydramine has been used extensively in pregnant women; the incidence of fetal malformations is the same as that which would be expected in women who are not taking medications. Additionally, studies in animals suggest no important effects on the fetus. Diphenhydramine, therefore, can be used in pregnancy if the physician feels that it is needed. </P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Holly_WA on July 04 2007 at 7:07pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- http://themeluginmonkeys.blogspot.com    Holly-mom to:    DH-David-Aspergers  Sarah-14y Anxiety  Rachel-13y Severe anxiety, Bipolar, ADD, LD\'s, CAPD  Jacob-9y HFA, anxiety, ADHD  Anna-7y anxiety???</div>'

'I think you\'re right to worry! Even a service dog still needs exercise, <br />training, grooming, feeding, and to have it\'s poop scooped!!! <br /> <br />The first thing to ask yourself, other than whether you\'re ready for all the <br />responsiilities that come with dog ownership, is what specific function <br />you\'re hoping the dog will fulfill with your daughter. <br /> <br />If you\'re wanting a dog to prevent your child from wandering, or find your <br />child should she wander off, you\'ll need a specially trained dog from a <br />major service dog organization. <br /> <br />If you\'re wanting a dog as a companion to your child, who will be her best <br />friend and help engage her, draw her out of herself, and give her a sense <br />of responsibility and self-esteem, then, provided your daughter actually <br /><em>likes</em> dogs, any old mutt will do! <br /> <br />We have three dogs, all rescues, and they\'re great for Donny. They\'ve <br />been good in teaching boundaries/appropriate behaviour around animals, <br />and in getting him to engage with another in a forceful, intentional, direct <br />manner. Dogs don\'t respond to \"sit\", when it\'s said from 5 feet away in a <br />sing-song voice by someone who\'s not looking at them - Donny\'s having <br />to learn to get eye contact, face the animal, stand tall, and firmly say \"sit\", <br />while using the hand signal. It\'s worth it to him, as he finds it very <br />rewarding when an animal responds to his directive. Donny also <br />practices following directions around making their food, putting it down, <br />putting a leash and collar on them, walking them, etc. <br /> <br />He absolutely LOVES our one little dog, and she\'s fantastic at cheering <br />him up when he\'s cranky - she would be considered a \"therapy dog\" I <br />think. <br /> <br />That said, I don\'t leave the dogs alone with Donny, he\'s not allowed to <br />walk them by himself. HE is too unpredictable, and dogs are only dogs <br />afterall! There\'s still a good amount of time where he\'s not appropriate <br />with them. He has a hard time understanding that they don\'t understand <br />screeching gibberish mixed with the words \"go away!\", shoving hands, <br />and nervous giggling. We\'re always talking about being nice to the dogs, <br />and if he doesn\'t want them near, either sit on a piece of furniture, or be <br />in his room (he tends to go lay on the floor by a dog, flop around, then <br />get grouchy when the dog gets excited and tries to lick him and play). <br /> <br />Also, breed does NOT matter. If you get a dog, choose a dog based on <br />what your family needs. If you\'re strapped for time already, I\'d choose a <br />sturdy, short-coated breed that can do without a ton of exercise. <br />However, know even the most low-maintenance dog is still going to need, <br />at the very least, a daily walk and two 10-15 minute training sessions per <br />day.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Donny 13 - classic autism, bipolar</div>'

'Whew! Today was the first day back at school. It was only a short day, <br />from 8:30-10:30, and Don managed to stay for half of that. First day is <br />always challenging because he\'s very keyed up (all the kids are), and it\'s <br />completely chaotic - kids haven\'t been sorted into classrooms yet, there\'s <br />no teaching or planned activities, etc. <br /> <br />Don woke up this morning, excited but nervous. He was still <br />apprehensive that we\'d be taking him to his old (bad) school, and kept <br />looking down the street at it, despite my reassuring him that he wasn\'t <br />going there, but was going to his school (some of y\'all might remember <br />he switched schools midway through last year, due to serious issues at <br />the school he was in). <br /> <br />When we arrived at school, the parking lot was a mess, there wasn\'t even <br />any parking. I had to park in the handicapped spot. We headed inside, <br />and it was very crowded and noisy. His classroom was overflowing into <br />the hallway - because classes haven\'t been sorted yet, they piled all <br />registered Gr. 4 kids (60 of them), plus their parents who\'d come with, <br />into a single classroom. We had to push through a line of people at the <br />back of the class, and ask a woman to please move, as she was sitting in <br />Donny\'s seat (he\'s got a special work area at the back of the class, as well <br />as a regular desk). About 5-10 minutes in, the teachers managed to <br />divert half the kids and parents into another room, thank goodness! <br /> <br />Don then got to sit in a desk, with a book, while the teacher talked about <br />expectations, and all the other orientation stuff, and handed out planners <br />and school supply lists. At one point, Donny put up his hand, and, when <br />the teacher called on him, said the teacher\'s name. The teacher <br />responded with, \"yes?\", and Don had completely forgotten what he was <br />going to say, so said, \"Everybody, jargonjargonjargon Transform.\" <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley36.gif\" border=\"0\"> <br />The teacher was a bit puzzled, so I just quickly inserted that Donny was <br />saying he was happy to be there with everyone <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"> <br /> <br />He did great with listening to and following instructions on a little ice <br />breaker activity (write your name on a slip of paper, toss it on the floor, <br />then pick one up - the name on your paper is who you interview). He was <br />a bit overwhelmed being interviewed, even with my and the TAs help, as <br />it meant all the kids were talking at once, and people were moving <br />around a bit in the room, but he did pretty well. It helped that the girl <br />interviewing him was a friend from last year. <br /> <br />Then, when it was his turn to interview someone, it was a bit goobered up <br />- the girl he was to interview was trying to interview another girl at the <br />same time. Don was trying to ask her the questions (with prompting), <br />but, as she was distracted, talking with the girl she was interviewing, it <br />was pretty overwhelming. He started to shut down with all the noise - it <br />was interesting, as it\'s the first time I\'ve been able to actually witness him <br />going into sensory overload. His eyes were getting glazed, and he was <br />having a hard time looking at anything, and it was obviously becoming <br />more and more difficult for him to hear. He started to look frightened - I <br />never realized before watching that what a scary experience it must be for <br />a kid to get overloaded that way. His TA and I managed to get his focus <br />long enough to ask him if he wanted a break (he did), and we got him out <br />of the class. <br /> <br />He went to his old classroom (which was empty), and drew on the board <br />for a bit, obviously trying to refocus. He then went back to his current <br />class, and was upset that it was still chaotic and noisy. He tried to run <br />out, and when I asked him to wait, he screeched once, but when I stopped <br />him and asked for words, he said (almost crying, poor guy <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"> ), \"May I <br />go on the computer please\". We had him put his book away, and went <br />down to the computer room. He was trying to wind down on that, and <br />then the computer froze... <br /> <br />He, understandably, started to meltdown a bit, kept saying, \"stupid, not <br />working!\", and started banging his fist on the table. He really wanted to <br />shut it down - it was hard for him to leave it there not working. We left <br />for a treat and then home - he was almost crying, from being <br />ovewhelmed, stressed out, and frustrated. He was convinced he\'d had a <br />bad day. <br /> <br />Now we\'re home and he\'s had a Rootbeer float from the drive thru, some <br />tortilla chips, and is watching Tree House. He\'s starting to wind down, <br />and is pretty tired. He\'s now recognizing that he did AWESOME, and Mom <br />and Dad are really proud of him.

'<P>I\'m catching up on my reading as we were out of town for a few weeks. The \"OT\" part of this thread caught my eye, as my family tree (and perhaps DH\'s) is not the greatest in terms of DDs.</P> <P>I have/had 2 brothers with downs syndrome, so yes, Tzoya, it does happen. And it is rare, as we never met another family like ours. My brothers were born in 1961 and 1964, and genetics studies were like a pipedream compared to the knowledge of today. These brothers came along AFTER my essentially NT sister and myself. In fact, my mother became pregnant 5 more times, 3 of which miscarried, one she chose to abort (VERY hard and emotional decision), and the last which resulted in my much younger \"baby\" brother. By societal standards, he is NT. Was my mom irresponsible, etc to get pregnant so many times after already having 2 downs children? No, but this was back when birth control options were not as varied as they are now (is that a good way to put it?).</P> <P>Anyway, our family found out in the early 70\'s that downs CAN be genetic and one parent can have a \"carrier gene\". I don\'t remember the specifics, just that my mother has it, as do I. None of the rest of my immediate family do, according to the geneticists at Johns Hopkins back then. I remember finding this out before I was even a teen, so my \"family plan\" was thought about long before I even wanted to kiss a boy!</P> <P>Fast forward to my 20\'s and having children myself... I have 4, the third one has autism. My last was conceived before Tony\'s evals/dx, so there was no turning back on my youngest. Having known I had the \"carrier gene\" for downs, my husband and I talked at great length with a genetics counselor, or priest, etc. about risking becoming parents. My brothers by this time were adults, and one was already dead. So we looked at having a family a lot differently than our peers. In that vein, I had amnios (sp?) with all 4 of my kids. By the time Tony was in utero, DH and I were more of the opinion that we would not abort if the test results revealed something, we would just be better prepared mentally at birth. Our thoughts on that was that yes, the amnio could reveal SOME disabilities, but not all. I don\'t think there are genetic \"markers\" yet for blindness, hearing impairment, etc. just to name a few \"lifelong\" disabilities.</P> <P>I for one totally respect Tzoya\'s point of view, as someday, in the not too distant future, my downs brother\'s care will fall on my shoulders. I would like to point out that the issue of having \"too many\" children has been a hot issue for years... disabled or not. And my personal opinion comes more from the perspective of living every day life, the financial and societal impact aside.</P> <P>For the last 2 years, I too have been a SAHM. Before that, I was fortunate enough to have my mom available for child care (particularly for Tony) and was able to work full time. For several reasons, I had to quit full-time work then and will be going back to work soon after our big move to DE in a few weeks. I truly believe we all contribute in our own way, and not being an \"individual taxpayer\" does not diminish the value of our contribution to society. There are pros and cons to THAT issue as well.</P> <P>I\'ll get off my soap box now! I really enjoy how everyone on this board feels comfortable sharing their opinions. BTW - we have also been in a 2 bedroom 1 bath home (apt no less) for the last 2 years. So again, I feel the conservatism there... count your blessings its just the 3 of you! <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"></P> <P>Mary</P>'

He falls much more frequently with shoes than without. He also whenever he is walking just wanders around the house aimlessly not playing or anything which I hate.

'<P><EM><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=4>I am new to this whole message board thing, but running out of ways to get information. My daughter got put on Risperdal last week and had 2-3 meltdowns (2 hrs each) for the first 2 days. She just cries and screams very loudly and doesn\'t want anyone to touch her. She seemed to be better the last 3 days, but now she has been back at school for 2 days and they want me to come and get her each time she has a meltdown. I told them I can\'t keep her home the rest of school year and that I think she is doing it somewhat to be able to come home. The doctor says that this is normal and it will take a few weeks for the medicine to adjust. Anyone have advice about what the school says or on the new medicine? I am the step-mom and have only had Chelsea for 6 months now (she moved from CA) and every time I think that things are going in a positive direction I find myself dealing with another new issue.

(I know its hard to trust the people with your child but I suggest phone interviews seeing if the people would be willing to meet with you briefly at a mcDonals playland or a park and start out having respite while you are there for a few hours cleaning so you know how it goes before actually leaving them with your kids!</P> <P>TELL HER you have NO IDEA whats available and you are overwhelmed.... </P> <P>As far as your custody situation playing into getting this help for your boys Im not sure what you mean?

'<P>I don\'t want to go into too much detail but I did want to let people know to check the clinical policy bulletins about coverage options for Autism frequently. I recently noticed a change on Aetna\'s that states intervention including ABA is medically necessary for children with Autism. There is lots of other mumbo jumbo in there and I haven\'t pushed it with them yet because we have a waiver but it sounds promising. It also says that even though Aetna feels it is medically necessary most plans will not include coverage...it is covered through the behavioral health portion which apparently many plans exclude. I am thinking my particular plan includes this because Aetna is reimbursing the state for many of my son\'s therapies. </P> <P>I don\'t really want to share specifics about my employer or the health plan I have but I did want to throw it out there because a couple of years ago this clinical policy bulletin specifically said these treatments were NOT medically necessary. So moral of the story is if you have Aetna as an option check it out to see if your plan covers ABA or other therapies...</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Heather  Mom of 6yo son with mod/sev Autism and severe hemophilia.

I have high blood pressure, fibromyalgia (a pain disorder that is made worse by stress and lack of sleep), arthritis, and abdominal adhesions ( another painful condition from my c-section in 96). I basically function, I don\'t exercise, I can not really plan for spa days or to have coffee with the girls, so whatever I do have time for I make it really count. I purchased a guitar for my bday last month and it has really relaxed me so much. The only problem is with my joint problems I often have stiff hands the next day.

In the problem I posted about, I did not go into details of ds behavior with dd, situations that arise and his reactions toward her - nothing anyone could really pick up on or relate to in regard to their relationship, only because I was concerned about dd and her feelings in this post.<br><br>QUOTE\"that your DS may feel that way towards DD as he sees her basicly excell in life where DS may find it more difficult or even impossible\"QUOTE<br><br>In your rambling way (which is a trait we share) you hit the nail on the head, entirely by accident, for this particular piece of ds puzzle. It took Dr. Phd. BCBA about 8 days of data analyzing and $500 of my money to figure out because it was not a clear cut case, and not simply a matter of ordinary sibling rivalry.<br><br>WHAT WOULD WE DO WITHOUT YOU?! Ramble all you like any time any post, even when your drunk and not making any sense at all - there\'s always something in there, even if just 2 words, that makes a lightbulb go off in someones head here!<br><br>Now, \"<font style=\"font-weight: bold;\" size=\"2\">Jeeze\"</font>, for your \"problem\" (which I have seen you post about before)<br><br>QUOTE\"...work doing the job I do driving forklifts which require no education, I have a nice small home, and may live here forever, never doing better, I want a family someday but that may very well escape me... I remain where I am forever. \"QUOTE<br><br>The \"being\" part of human is the fact that you CAN have whatever tangible things it is your heart desires, IF you TRULY want it. This is not something new, or some crazy way of thinking - it works - trust me, I know. Of course, there are certain things that can never happen, but they really are few and far between. Most important in obtaining WANTS is to not sell yourself short. Set one goal at a time and run with it!!!! There is NOTIME to waste in life - get/take everything it is you want. The road may get bumpy, don\'t give up, figure a way around, there are many avenues to take. The only drawback is that you will have to sacrifice certain things to obtain the one thing that you are currently working toward. I could explain and keep rambling about how, lecturing on can and can\'t, but I\'m sure you know what I mean. The only true reality is you can only want for yourself, not for anyone else. I\'ve gotten EVERYTHING I\'ve ever wanted so far in my life and I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth. The ONLY thing I want now and am willing to give up all else for is my son to be able to \"function\" without any assistance and communicate. But because of his neuro limitations, it just doesn\'t seem to work for him. He concentrates on what he wants now. He\'s a kid, so his priorities are fun ones. He wants to keep making those jump shots, play ball on the big boys team and climb on the highest rooftops (literally). And despite what they say about his motor \"problems\" (yeah, right-idiots) he can, he does and he will because he WANTS to. <br><br>One last piece of unwanted advice \"Be careful what you wish for\"!! Boy is that ever true.<br><br>If you choose to reply to this, I would like to know what are your roadblocks. I would love to help you as you have been helping me. I\'m great at this stuff, like you are great at figuring out the ASD mind stuff.<br><br>Now, I expect a wedding invitation, christening (or brisk, whatever) invitation, a housewarming party invitation and a Conrats on your new job party invitation with in the next 10 years!

'<P> I feel your concern, when my dd went to preschool for the first time and keep in mind this was spose to be a school that is used to working with kiddos like mine which is autism. She was 3 years old never done any sort of school. I went to find out that they would put her in a chair like that because they couldnt get her to sit for circle time. I am like what do you expect. You have to work at it. Some of these teacher just dont have patients for children like ours. Its like well have them be a helper during circle time. After that we no longer having her go to that school, we had more problems with them. My dd didnt even finish her first week there.</P> <P> I was told by a good friend, follow your gut feeling!! If you honestly can say to yourself it doesnt feel right then say this is not right and I do not approve and if they comply I would do pop visits just to make sure they are doing what you want them to do.</P> <P> There are different ways to get your child to slowly learn to sit for circle time. Like giving them a book of there own when its circle time to keep them sitting. But you actually have to work at it and not just throw them in a chair that they can not get out of. I honestly think those chairs are ment for severly handycap children so they can be on the same floor level as the other children, and someone thought it would be a great thing to stick our kids in them because its easier and they dont have to be distracted by the child. Sorry I could go on with this. It just breaks my heart and I feel your concern.</P> <P> Just remember do what your gutt says.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Never give up</div>'

On our way home from group therapy, he saw a kid from his school. In fact the kid recognized him first and spoke to him and he completely ignored him and started kicking a wall. This is a kid that he always talks about. He seems to admire this kid too. </FONT></P> <P><FONT color=#9900cc size=3>I am just so beat up right now.

It gets so frustrating when he is trying to say something to me and I don\'t understand and believe you and me I kill myself to make sense of what he is saying. I dread asking him to repeat things because this becomes a knock down drag out war. He completely looses it. Going to the park is supposed to be a breath of fresh air but when we go, it is him complaining that he has no one to play with. I\'ve tried showing him how to play with the kids, standing near while he asks to play, telling him repeatedly to play, to just kicking a ball with him myself. Sometimes, he will get lucky and play with another child (rarely) but altimately, he his right by my side. He is getting to the point where he would prefer to stay in his room and watch Charlie and the Chocolate Factory all day if he could. I have to force him out to get air and excercise. </FONT></P> <P><FONT color=#9900cc size=3>This is not how I pictured my life with my son to be. I feel so cheated today by autism.

'I would definitely give them (and the doctor once you get an appt.) the WHOLE list. You should ask how many \"standard deviations\" below normal your child is in each area. Ask what the criteria is for receiving services. Schools have to obey the law when it comes to giving services. That means, a child has to be a certain amount below normal before services can be given, legally. The schools MIGHT say you should check into getting an evaluation from a medical doctor to rule out or rule in autism. You can ask the school to pay for that medical evaluation. Around here, kids who are sent to the autism experts through the school district get bumped to the top of the waiting list. Actually, a medical diagnosis is not required in order to receive services. However, for your own peace of mind and also to help cut through red tape, you should get one. The schools can give your child the educational label of autism without the medical diagnosis but many are reluctant to take that step.'
'The nighttime stimming is a hard one. My son did it too and I used to tell him to be quiet, time for sleep. But mostly I tried to ignore it because I was too tired to intervene all the time.

'My friend is autistic and was tested for deafness throughout her childhood. Her best friend even bought her a hearing test once for her birthday in adulthood, because she was very concerned about her. She tested as far above average in all areas of hearing. It wasn\'t a matter of her not hearing things, it was a matter of how she was interpreting what she heard, which parts of things she was paying attention to, and how much or how little she was reacting outwardly to what she heard.<br><br>'

'I would find the local expert in autism, hopefully a psychiatrist. I think they do a better job than neurologists because psychicatrists treat the MIND, not just the brain. And, yes, the hormones can play a HUGE part. Please try to find out what doctor in your area is the \"go-to\" autism specialist. Especially since your child is a girl, she needs a doctor who has actually treated a lot of girls on the spectrum and they are in the minority. Good luck.'

Also, someone in yr school district\'s special education department may have info on what\'s available in yr state. Do they have an autism specialist, or maybe a behaviorist? Maybe the local health department would be helpful? When Zach began school they gave me info about the waiver, and it was easy to sign up.

'DS is still hitting at his schools. He did not hit from 3.5years to 4.5years and then it bascially started up again several months ago. Mid-Nov to Dec it dwindled considerably, but now it\'s back again: hitting peers-even hitting teachers at times. Hitting is becoming for him, his primary coping mechanism-when he\'s frustrated he hits. I have a reward system set up for him when he doesn\'t hit, but this week he\'s hit in several different environments. Last week he had a good week, but this week has been pretty darn terrible. I just don\'t get it. Everyone is trying to help him not hit, but it just keeps happening. Sometimes it\'s sensory overload, sometimes he\'s annoyed with a peer, sometimes he\'s angry at a teacher-it\'s such a range of reasons that it\'s just basically his coping mechanism. Hitting gets him out of difficult social situations he\'d rather not navigate, gets him attention, gets him out of difficult sensory environments. In many ways, hitting is an effective behavior for him for getting what he needs/wants. I\'m just at a loss in terms of what else to do. I just find it so depressing. I\'m trying to help him as much as I can and I can\'t get this hitting thing to stop and am envisioning all sorts of problems down the road when he starts kindergarten and gets bigger...<br>Nowwhat<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS, 7, Autism, little DS, 5, PDD-NOS</div>'

He said, \"Drive. And work in a videogame store.\"<br>I moved on and asked if anything was hard for him and he said, \"Talking to people. I don\'t know what to say. I can hardly talk to my friends.\" (I could see he was uncomfortable as we visited at Christmastime.

As of now, I don\'t think he will have the \"normal\" goals of wife and kids. I just can\'t see it, but we\'ll see. It\'s totally up to him. Autism means he will forever be naive.

This would make him angry, but he had a new opportunity each day to try to keep the Buzz and Woody one dry. Believe it or not, it eventually evened out in terms of how many of each we used.

'<P>Autism can run in families and even if other sibs aren\'t on the spectrum, things like ADHD and dyslexia are common in families with autism. Getting full evals for both boys is important. </P> <P>An IEP is based on NEED, not diagnosis. Since a diagnosis has not changed the test results for your son (why would it?), the services don\'t necessarily have to change. That is, unless you think they are NOT addressing some issues. YOu can ask for assessments in any area of weakness you perceive is not being addressed. In particular, I\'d ask for an OT eval and ask that it include assessing for sensory integration dysfunction.</P> <P>I\'ve said a million times over the years here that a MEDICAL diagnosis for a young child with autism is not at all necessary and that the school district doesn\'t even have to consider it. What they HAVE to do is consider the child\'s actual needs. Obviously, a lot of the need STEMS from the autism. But special education law is written specifically to exclude the requirement that a medical diagnosis be present. The child just has to fit the educational label, in this case Autism. So it\'s no surprise at all that a medical dx hasn\'t changed a thing for your son.</P> <P>That said, I\'d pursue evaluations for your other son asap. The system has to address HIS needs, too, with or with a medical dx. IF he has needs. </P>'

'<font size=\"2\">Rainman, the young Aspie who was here, got a PM telling him, in essence, that not everyone here embraces AS the way HE does. This is a 20 year old Aspie who is trying to make it. It devestated him and made him feel so unwelcome and upset him so much that his parents blocked the site. You are PARENTS of these kids. Whoever wrote that should be ashamed of herself! Honestly, you parents are not as tolerant as you think you are, yet you want people to embrace your kids. This is exactly how your kids will be treated by others who don\'t understand. But YOU should understand. I\'m sure the majority of you are horrified that this happened, but he and I struck up a friendship offline (because he badly needs friends) and I was stunned that anyone here would do that. Any of you who think even being an Aspie is easy needs a reality check. And maybe he didn\'t belong here, but he deserved the same warm welcome that most people get here. Look at yourself, whoever sent that PM, and look at your poor child, and I pity your child. I\'m taking time off, and will come back later, under a different name, to help with the interventions of these kids. The fact is, my son and I have had more experience than most here. And I\'ll never mention I\'m an Aspie because apparently you\'re not supposed to. Between so many parents here not getting me, even questioning the diagnosis, and sending such a hateful letter to Rainman, I have to wonder if you kids WILL reach their potential or if they will be so stressed out that they won\'t. This doesn\'t apply to those who are as horrified as me, but anyone who sees this as \"ok\" has a serious issue about autism and, considering you have a child with it, you need to ask yourself if this is the kind of treatment you would want if you child inappropriately misunderstands what a board is for and signs up for an Aspie/Autie site and then is sent an e-mail telling him off. You are going to learn, whether you think so or not, that your kids ARE different, don\'t always get it, and that you are NOT going to have a child who will understand the little or sometimes big things that other people do, and I hope your kids are treated with more sensitivity than me and Rainman (especially him) got here. GTTO, you\'re brave to keep posting here. When I\'m back, I\'ll live somewhere else, be someone else, etc...just give good help. And I\'m not reading your responses because there are too many people here who don\'t \"get\" ASD in spite of having a child who is or teaching them. You have to be tolerant of adult ASDers too because your kids will be them one day and one of the biggest problems as an adult is being misunderstood. I wish you luck. Some of you are appallingly lacking in understanding of others who are not your own kids, yet you expect teachers, strangers, and family members who don\'t understand to treat your own child great.

'Jake was always the greatest sleeper EVER. He slept through the night at <br />3 weeks. When we moved him from a crib to a bed, he wouldn\'t stay <br />there all night long, but he would only wake up long enough to walk <br />down the hall and climb into our bed. Then, about a few months ago, he <br />would wake up around 1:00am FREAKING OUT. He screamed and <br />screamed and there was absolutely nothing we could do about it. You <br />couldn\'t talk to him, you couldn\'t touch him, he wanted all the lights off <br />and he really really wanted you to pay attention to his freaking out. It <br />could last an hour, there was no way for him to tell us what was wrong, <br />we had no idea what set him off, and there was nothing we could do to <br />stop it; we just had to wait for him to exhaust himself and then pass out <br />again. <br /> <br />Eventually we figured it out: Low blood sugar! He was hungry. He didn\'t <br />eat a good dinner and didn\'t drink his milk before bed. His hunger woke <br />him, or something woke him, and he was so ultra cranky and tired he just <br />let it all out all over the place. We figured it out because when he was <br />hungry during the day he would start to tantrum in the same way, and <br />eating something made him stop immediately.

'You have to be careful with kids and only give them what it is that they want, when they are displaying behavior you want to enforce. If you give them the car when they are screaming, you teach them that is how to get what you want.

'<P>Mysh,</P> <P>When I worked on a med/surg floor several years ago it was standard for the surgeon to come to the room and talk to the parents before the child was moved. The main thing to remember , if it\'s not in his chart or on his body, nobody will know. So, you can make some notes (bright colored post-its work well), and then ask the dr to please put these requests in his chart. Also they can put a band around his wrist that says \"autistic/non-verbal\". If we have any type of alert , allergy, or concern we write it on a red band. Lastly, doctors do take into account that a child needs to have a parent there when they wake up, so that shouldn\'t be an issue. Is this a children\'s hospital he\'s going to? They are a bit more considerate to the child. I was very nervous when my son had to be admitted and sedated for an EMG.

'Thanks again for all the suggestions- <br />So far the following approaches have not worked: <br />1. Confiscate toys that are thrown- he has so many toys and is not too <br />attached to any particular one, so he will just move on the the next toy. <br />2. Try to prevent the throwing from happening- he doesn\'t give any <br />\"warning signs\" before the act of throwing (as opposed to JulieA\'s child, <br />who scoops up his toys before throwing). He literally can seem content <br />one second and the next you will see a plastic missile flying from out of <br />nowhere (kind of like in kung fu movies, like \"House of Flying Daggers\") <br /> <br />I guess the key is to figure out which mode of communicating that <br />\"throwing is not acceptable\" will click with him.

'<P>I was wondering about this. I first thought something might be wrong when Nate was a baby. I had pre-eclampsia but also was a Navy wife so received no treatment for that. They actually messed up pretty badly. I was so swollen I couldn\'t wear shoes of any kind, feet didn\'t fit. If you touched my arm you\'d dent it, it was terrible. I showed up for my appt when I was 9 days overdue and they had mistakenly scheduled me for a day the clinic was closed. They said I\'d need to wait another 2 wks for an appt, I had waited 17 days for that one I wasn\'t waiting again. I was sent up to the \"labor deck\" to be evaluated. When I got there they told me I wasn\'t who I said I was because I was in the back being induced already. The dr had gotten the charts mixed up and thought someone else was me the day before and induced them instead. They were only 37 wks, I was almost 42. They did an ultrasound to check for cord placement once they were convinced I was who I said I was and, after I explained to the dr how to turn the machine on, they said the cord was nowhere near his neck. Unfortunately the dr was wrong, it was wrapped twice. The labor was fine until the cord began to choke him. Then they rushed me to a delivery room and a nurse jumped on a stool and literally pushed him from my body. Yes, there was meconium, but not a lot. I was in labor about 24 hrs.</P> <P>When I brought him home I sat and rocked him for hours waiting for him to go to sleep. He just laid and stared with the hugest eyes. Finally I had to get my older child a drink so I laid him in his cradle for less than 5 minutes. When I came back he was sound asleep. That became his pattern, if you wanted him to sleep you had to lay him down. He was a very calm baby, rarely cried and slept a lot. Or so I thought, as it turned out he wasn\'t sleeping. I finally decided to go in and wake him up, to not allow him to sleep for hours, and when I went in his room he was just sitting in his crib staring at the wall. He wouldn\'t even acknowledge that you had walked in the room usually. Sometimes he\'d be rocking. He didn\'t like any toys until he discovered his brother\'s matchbox cars. I don\'t think he ever would have walked if it weren\'t for matchbox cars. He\'d do anything to get his hands on one. When he\'d get one he\'d run it around and around on the coffee table in circles. He literally wore a groove in the table. Later he began to line them up and you couldn\'t touch them. Then he began being interested only in the wheels. He\'s never played with any other toy, not even the playsets for the cars. </P> <P>I thought it was funny when he finally spoke and his first word was cookie. He didn\'t say momma or dadda until much later. When he was 2 if we would buy him a pack of M &amp; M\'s while we were out he would refuse to eat them until we were home. Then he would dump them all out on the table, sort them by color and throw away the brown ones because you just don\'t eat those. In fact, all brown foods are bad, if you were wondering. Now he doesn\'t eat M &amp; M\'s either because there\'s brown inside. </P> <P>Some milestones he met, some he didn\'t. He loved his jumper, would jump in it for hours. All along the way I mentioned these things to his dr. His dr always brushed me off, told me I was complaining about having a content child. He told me I was upset because he didn\'t act needy enough and I was a person who needed to be needed. I tried not to complain after that and actually lied sometimes to the pediatrician about certain things so that the dr would stop thinking poorly of me. Maybe I wasn\'t being attentive enough, I thought. Maybe I was just missing all of the things Nate could do. What bothered me most was the blank stare that Nate often had. It\'s a mouth gaping stare that he still has and wears whenever he\'s not connecting with us. And he never ran to us for a hug, or wanted to be cuddled. I missed that with him. There were many other little things. I didn\'t realize that they all added together, I viewed them all separately. But I always knew something wasn\'t right, there was a problem somewhere. </P> <P>Nate wasn\'t diagnosed until this past year. He\'s 9 now. They rated his anxiety and it\'s in the 97th percentile along w/ paranoid schizophrenics. They say he lives in a constant anxiety attack. I really wish that someone had listened sooner but I can\'t change that. </P> <P>One other odd thing to add to this long post... We lived in Navy housing. Nate was born in the summer. Navy housing is infamous for it\'s pest control trucks. They drive around all summer long spraying pesticides so thickly you can\'t breathe outside, you go inside but the stench penetrates the house. I\'ve heard some theories that one of the catalysts to ASD could possibly be pesticide exposure. If that is true then I know where Nate got exposed. </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Tia</div>'

'<P>JM,</P> <P>I would love to speak with you offline.</P> <P>You sound like a very involved parent. Not that it mattersa, but are you a Dad or a Mom? You strike me as a Dad.</P> <P>The thing is this: As has been expressed here, autism comes in so many different shades.</P> <P>You noted to sunny, \"If your 3 year old can go up and insult somebody can he actually be considered ASD?\" (Paraphrasing).</P> <P>Well, one of the criteria that might be an aspect of an ASD is not understanding the social mores...not quite fitting in . It has been noted that sometimes (I will be using sometimes here over and over again because there is nothing static in any of this) a child living with Asperger\'s has no censor and will say anything that comes into their head. They may or may not understand that it is socially inappropriate to tell someone that their hair is a mess or their clothes smell...etc.</P> <P>Also, ASD kids become fascinated with things. Asperger\'s kids have been known to get fixated on a topic intersting to them and may go and put in the face of others because they simply assume that they will be as interested as they are! I knew a boy once who was fascinated with aquariums. No matter the topic of conversation he always brought it back around to aquariums which was pretty awkward, but...not to him...that is what he wanted to talk about and he saw no reason to sit bored with with what someone else was describing when his information was so much more interesting.</P> <P>My son is gifted though not quantifiably (we have never had him tested for such)...it is my perception, and much like you, I hope that he will be indistinguishable from NT kids by age 6 or 7 and have even been told so by his developmental pediatrician (but his testing PhD says otherwise), but I don\'t know if he will. Everyone seems to have some answer! It makes for real craziness. Maybe he will just be \"the quirky kid\" by then...I don\'t know. </P> <P>What I do know and have accepted is the fact that he will always be on the spectrum. That part does not go away it only comes in different shades. I would be very careful about having the diagnosis lifted and the services going elsewhere because if you decide you need them...you will have a tough time coming back.</P> <P>I hear the anguish and torture in your posts. I am going out on a limb hear to say that I think that you might want to ask yourself why it is so important to have the label gone. Is it for him or...for you?</P> <P>Get more evals. Get the testing done. Search this board for PDD andtess and anything else you like or ask the questions and someone will steer you towards the information.

We have a 13yos who is profoundly disabled, then we adopted our 10yos as a preemie baby - a very sick foster baby. What I meant to say about his police idea is that now that my son is getting older - his public meltdowns could result in police intervention.

A typical problem that develops at this point is that parents give in to temper tantrums. This in turn develops a \"pathologic\" situation, where instead of the parents teaching their abnormal children normal socially accepted behavior, the entire family \"learns\" the abnormal behavior from their affected children. This causes the child to lose his chance of being appropriately directed into socially accepted behavior from early on, as should be done. </FONT> <P><FONT face=\"Times New Roman, Times, serif\" size=2>As a rule, parents who change their normal behavior in order to accommodate their children\'s abnormal behavior are doing a severe disservice to their children and to themselves. The correct approach must include a firm, strict discipline to correct all their child\'s abnormal autistic behavior (see behavior modification). Typical mistakes in this regard include letting the kids run around with food because they refuse to sit by the table, allowing their children to carry an exaggerated variety of objects or toys everywhere they go in order to pacify them, letting their kids get away with holding their bottles or pacifiers, or refusal to eat certain consistencies of foods in order to keep the peace and prevent temper tantrums. </FONT> <P><FONT face=\"Times New Roman, Times, serif\" size=1><FONT size=2>In the long run, however, tantrums are unavoidable because there is a point where the parents cannot keep up with their children\'s unreasonable requirements, and if the response of the parents to the unreasonable request is not fast enough or not complete enough, the tantrum will occur. The best way to stop the tantrums right from the onset is to help the child adjust to the requirements of society. In the long and short run, it will be easier to change the child\'s behavior rather than \"change the world\" and society to adjust to the child\'s abnormal requirements</FONT>.</FONT></P>'

I wish I could help you with discipline. I can\'t, but I can give you hope. At age 4 1/2, my son broke into speech and, like many strange autistic behaviors that happen to our kids, his bad behavior stopped as though it had never been there. He never raged again. He never hit or bit again. He was fairly compliant. Today he is almost 13 and the most mellow kid on the face of the earth, almost a couch potato. People can\'t believe he was once diagnosed with ADHD. Our kids change SO MUCH. I\'m not sure how much traditional discipline helps autistic kids since often their motivation for behavior is so different than \"typicals.\" Oh, yeah. My son also nevr slept and, if we didn\'t watch him, could leave the house at 3am and run naked into the street. We got permission from Social Services (he was a foster child then) to use a hook to lock him in his room at night for his own safety as long as we had a monitor in his room so he could wake us up.

I do not think at all that one can say that \"most\" will not grow into a satisfying, independent life. Look at how this board has changed even in the past year. We have had major skirmishes b/c what some of the newer parents are describing as problems just do not even sound like they\'re in the same ballpark as others. Frankly, some of the kids who are described here sound like they have issues, but are not debilitated, by any means. Some sound to me like they are barely on the Spectrum. What I see on this board, often, is that a lot of parents freak out over a recent dx because they are envisioning old school autism, when, in fact, their kid <EM>is</EM> most likely going to develop into a pretty average person. </P> <P>IMHO, of course.</P> <P>Not only has the diagnosis broadened considerably, but the treatments and therapies have come a very long way, as well, even in the past decade.

'My son\'s speech therapist would agree with you Auttie. My son is 3 and has very bad eye contact. His speech therapist was working on this with him. But after a lot more research on chilren with Autism and eye contact, decided to back off. Would we rather him carry on a conversation appropriately or look us in the eyes? Right now, he can\'t do both. Also, she said that a lot of children with Autism have better peripheral vision and they are actually seeing you better if they look at you peripherally. So, we have backed off. He seem to like this better. One day we might work on it more, but not now. We would rather see progression on his language than his eye contact, right now.'

He runs around the room with a zoned out look and what seems as though he\'s trying to get everything in. I can tell myself he is overstimulated.

'We have 2 books for our older dd, to help explain autism & all. <br />She\'s known all along about her sister\'s special health needs & <br />developmental delays, but \'autism\' is a fairly new term here. We keep her <br />in the loop, to the extent that she will comprehend. Anyway, I had taped <br />the Nick News special on Autism from April, after my sister recommended <br />it. So, dd & I watched it. I wanted her to see how kids on the spectrum <br />are so varied, how some kids can even play hockey or piano, and also to <br />see all the other siblings who are dealing with the same issues she is. <br /> <br /><font size=\"2\">Five minutes into it, they were discussing symptoms & hand- <br />flapping. She immediately says: \"Well, of course \'E\' has autism. I don\'t <br />know why they didn\'t just tell us earlier. She does all those hand things <br />too!\" I laughed because it was just so matter of fact to her. With a tone <br />of \"duh people!\" to it.

'Hi, although I am no physician, it does sound like he could have an autism spectrum disorder. His repeating of words, twisting hands, licking objects, are all typical of autistic behaviors. My son does all of these too. He was diagnosed at 32 months, and has been in an autistic classroom setting since then. At the beginning (3 years old), he never noticed other children, avoided eye contact, but was never \"totally\" withdrawn. He was always tolerant of a hug from us, and loved to be tickled by his siblings, but that was about the extent of his interaction.<br><br>Now at 5 years old, he does show interest in children, although the way he shows interest in not typical of other 5,4, or 3 year olds. He will approach them and push them, not to be mean, just to try and interact. He will approach a total stranger on line in a grocery store, and plant his face in their BUTT<img src=\"smileys/smiley5.gif\" border=\"0\">!!! If someone in an office says hi to him, he\'ll walk up, and touch them in the chest, or squeal in their face while smiling. So, he\'s not withdrawn either, just inappropriate.<br><br>It\'s not that autistic kids don\'t interact with others, it\'s just the WAY that they do that makes it unusual. Most 5 year olds would simply approach another child and say \"hi, I\'m so and so, what\'s your name\", or \"do you want to play\", etc.<br><br>Still, the interest my son has in other children now, is still an improvement from a year or two ago when he was totally oblivious to them.<br><br>Please take your son to a neurologist, or a developmental pediatrician. He can still benefit from therapeutic intervention like ABA, speech, and OT to address his falling out of chair and licking things.<br><br>Good luck!! Keep us posted<br>'

'<FONT size=2>Well, this was in the works for some time, and it was tied in to my not wanting to lose my disability (I have a lot of trouble keeping jobs and still have two young kids). I don\'t think I\'d have sought out a diagnosis otherwise. I\'m 53 and just would have figured I\'m an Aspie and so be it. But Disability requires a diagnosis. I already have Bipolar, but that isn\'t enough to keep me from being able to hold sometimes very easy jobs. I had four meetings (two hours each) with an ASD Specialist in my area. He listened to my life <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley36.gif\" border=\"0\">, spoke to me, then get me a gazillion tests!!! Based on my work history, early history (I didn\'t let my mother hold me as an infant and kicked anyone who tried to touch me), spoke early and like a \'little professor (still do), wrote words at age two, and my mother thought I was a genuis until I got to school and really struggled both academically (math) and socially was totally ostracized, etc., blah, blah, you know the drill. I\'ve always had trouble with social cues, \"getting\" social norms, and life has been a big ball of confusion for me. Worse, my parents thought I was just being \"lazy\" when I lost jobs and threw me out of the house. They refused to help me. I got married twice because I knew I couldn\'t live independently. After my divorce, I tried to make it on my own, but I couldn\'t so I married my current hub, and, fortunately, it has worked out. My first marriage was terrible, but I stuck it out for seventeen years because I knew it would be hard for me and kids if I divorced him, and, boy, was I right!!!! I did divorce him, and almost lost our house! I never felt comfortable around most people. Small talk is impossible for me. I\'m comfy only around the three people or so who \"get\" me, so that I dont\' have to put on an act that I\'m just like everyone else. I\'m not, and it\'s quite stressful for me to try (and often fail anyways). I sometimes get people mad and don\'t understand what I did, so if that happens here, please tell me. There are also times I get confrontational on purpose because I so strongly disagree with the person and feel that the response is damaging to ASDers (which I have a double special interest in). And I\'ll tell you that, if you ask...lol. Anyone who thinks it\'s easy to have Aspergers is fooling herself...it\'s been very hard. Of course, I didn\'t have any interventions and no family help. I think the latter was my biggest problem. I really did need to live with somebody, and was thrown out instead. I still delegate household finances and scheduling to hub. If hub passes before me, I\'ll have to move to be close to grown kids. I still have trouble even sweeping the floor right...lol. I don\'t know how to hold a broom right and am very clumsy.

Most of it is immediate, but occassionally it will be delayed, and she will repeat a sentence she heard earlier a couple of times, as if she is trying it out. The boys echo too, I\'m not sure yet if its normal echoing in a speech delayed child since their speech is probably at about a 30 month level or a sign of their autism.

Vaccinations were not on a schedule- he recieved only 1 shot per visit, 4 hib total (2,4,6 and 12m) , at 15 and 18m he had the polio vax and 24m he had a DT only. He has never had MMR. As a baby he had no sensory issues, and actually ate much more than my husband would ever consider. <br><br>Somewhere between 18 and 24m something changed- he became more fearful of things- loud moises, riding on the tractor with my dad- the vacumn cleaner- stuff that had never bothered him. He also became more picky about food. He stopped trying to put words together. We couldnt ever decide if he was loosing words- it seemed like he was acquiring new words, just not using the old ones as much- so there were only abt 12-15 words he would use at a time, although he knew hundreds, and could name flash cards all day if you could get his interest. <br><br>Fast forward 2 yrs. We didnt go the therapy route. Well I take that back. When he was abt 2.5 we decided to try private pay speech therapy- it was a very expensive disaster. 3 months and i swear he was more oppositional than when we put him in therapy because of the adverserial situation she created with him. So last school yr we decided to approach the public school system. Because he was about to turn 4 they kinda kept putting us off. We got shuffled around a bit, and in that time someone flipped a switch and the speech started pouring out. We have a hard time getting him to be quiet now- and it gets better every day- we went from couple word phrases and LOTS of single words to real sentences. He still is terrible at using pronouns, and cant ask a question, but hey, we have come a looong way in a matter of months. <br><br>So anyway, he finally starts the school program back in March after a failed attempt at a \"regular\" preschool. He would bolt out of the class. Wasn\'t working for the teacher. Anyway, after a week in the \"autism\" class, the teacher tells me that she is having none of the trouble that he was, and that she doesnt thin he is autistic. That if we pushed hard we MIGHT could get a PDD_NOS label, and that later in life he may end up with an Aspergers label, but that in all of her experience she hasn\'t ever seen a autie that was anything like Liam. She also thinks we should wait to have a label until we need it for some reason. <br><br>Realizing now that I haven\'t described my child at all. He is now 4.5. He is umm brilliant- he can watch you do anything mechanical once and copy it. He can navigate a computer better than many adults I know. Oh, forgot to mention that the speech started when we realized that he could read. He are suprised daily at how MUCH he can read- his therapist had the speech picture cards flipped over to where the word side was up, and he went through 3-4 categoies reading abt 85-90 percent of them before he lost interest. Knows, colors, shapes, numbers, anything academic. He seems to have no real sensory issues other than he is extremely picky like his daddy- loves bread and cream cheese and oatmeal and other things are hit or miss. He loves to talk, is very friendly with adults- other kids he doesnt seem to have a clue how to play with. He iIS interested in playing, just doesnt understand how to engage them. Everything is big with Liam- he is a big loud boy who is always in motion. He runs, he jumps he pulls you along. He is overexhuberant. He has a hard time sitting, unless it is a task he is interested in. He is very self driven. <br><br>OK, so this year, they are trying to combine the class that he was in for 3m last yr 9the autism class) w typical peers in a headstart program. There are 15 kids total (10NT, 5 with some sort of spectrum issue). 1 teacher, 2 aides, and then a head teacher w ASD experience who bounces back and forth between the 2 classes. He attends from 830-1230, M-F. Well of course liam has ended up in the class that isnt working very well. He also isnt getting the therapy in the IEP. The other thing is, the IEP was written back when he would cooperate for no testing at all. It was also written before we even started in this class- when he was still trying to attend a typical preschool. Has been amended a few times but it is a mess basically. <br><br>What I am trying to do is go in with a bit of ammo. Typically they do \"group\" speech therapy for autistic kids becuase it is language therapy and not speech per se. Liam has some articulation issues though, as well as language. I would say his languiage delay is abt a yr or a smidge more at this point. Liams IEP says he gets 2 30 min sessions of speech per week, and since school started, they have only been doing 1 group session. They are still trying to get their act together, but hasnt quite happened yet. Anyway, I think he needs at least 1 private session per week- liam learns much better one on one. I think at the very least the group needs to be done w typical peers present. Right now he is only recieving 2x a MONTH of OT- I think this needs to change too. <br><br>I guess I want your experiences- what type of therapy are you recieving from the school system? How can I push this?? They are calling the class in general therapy, and although I think his teacher is great, I am not sure I would agree. How can we come up with a number for the amount of speech? How about OT?<br><br>Sorry so long- I will come back and edit for typos when I get the kids to bed- oh I almost forgot- I also have a 16m old boy :)<br>thanks so much if you got this far!<br>heather<br><br><br>'

'I chose to use the word \"perform\" purposely. He looked as though he knew his cue and did what was expected of him. He \"acted\" NT. When he didn\'t realize the camera was on him, his relaxed face looked very spaced out to me, much more like the autistic kids I know. Fred\'s mother noticed the same thing, apparently, because she used the phrase \"well trained.\" The fact is, if this little boy can function as well as it appears he can, then whether or not he has \"recovered\" is not the issue. Clearly, functioning well is the goal. It\'s just that I don\'t believe he\'s recovered at all. He just regained lost skills and developed far better skills than most kids do. I applaud the parents\' efforts as well as their clear statement that this sort of \"recovery\" doesn\'t happen to all, even if parents, professionals and kids put their ALL into it. Their son got the proper interventions and was lucky that his brain reacted so positively to them. He is the rare, rare exception, tho I have seen EVERY child who got ABA interventions improve a great deal. I\'ve also seen kids who got TEACHH interventions and other types of therapy improve as well. I even know a teenager who got just the most modest interventions improve. Probably all our kids would improve without ANY interventions. However, they would improve far, far less than if they get appropriate interventions early enough. I think the \"recovered\" boy is an excellent example of what a minority of kids can be like. One never knows WHO will be in that minority, so it pays for all of us to try. The video of that boy shows him at a far more involved level in preschool than my son ever was and now he\'s far more advanced than my son. To some extent, it\'s the luck of the draw. But we don\'t know WHICH ones will have brains that change enough to advance to a nearly NT functioning. So we all must try, IMHO.'

'We have been getting a lot of question from the school district about our auties and our future plans for them. Currently we homeschool our oldest two children and they are aware of that and keep questioning me about our intentions. Then we have 5 little ones also that are not school age yet.

Three of these children (the adopted ones) were formerly foster children and they are related to me. <br> The therapists at the school (ST for 60 min, OT &amp; PT, 30 min each, plus 1 on 1 preschool- we are a rural area and have no preschool class so they are doing 1 on 1 up at the public school an hour a week) all spend time doing exactly what we are doing at home already.

'<P>Hey,</P> <P>I\'m the mother to a very special 27 month old little girl, as yet undiagnosed. She was a 34 week preemie so we didn\'t think a lot of her delays until getting closer to her 2nd birthday - we thought she was just a little behind, nothing too special. After getting her assessed, it turns out she was a lot further behind than we thought. </P> <P>At 27 months, she only says a handful of words and very rarely in any sort of context. She\'s lost a lot of speech too (used to randomly say mum, dad, no but doesn\'t anymore). The only 3 words she actually uses properly are \'ta\' for when she takes something she wants, \'meow\' for when she sees a cat, and \'bye\' when she\'s going somewhere or wanting to leave somewhere. She has a few random words (five, fish, and \'good girl\' as one word are the big ones right now) that she uses with no context at all. Just randomly while playing or in attempted conversation. She babbles a lot and makes a full range of sounds, but no actual communication. She doesn\'t recognise words (though she knows no, bye, meow, ta, and her name) and doesn\'t point to anything - whether it\'s something she wants, or something she\'s asked to point to. Nothing sinks in.</P> <P>Lately she\'s taken to hurting herself whenever she\'s frustrated with something - banging her head into hard objects enough to leave lumps and bruises, scratching, biting, hitting, pinching. I have no idea where it\'s come from or what I should do about it. Her speech therapist - the only therapist she has right now - didn\'t have any suggestions. I\'m worried about pandering to it and reinforcing the behaviour, but if I don\'t stop it she hurts herself quite badly. She cries when she does, but she doesn\'t usually respond to pain at all (things like when she falls over).</P> <P>She\'s only just started walking, too.</P> <P>She\'s a very social creature though - she doesn\'t interact much with other kids at playgrounds and things, but she likes to watch them. She doesn\'t like it when they touch her and she doesn\'t like to touch them. Her eye contact used to be shocking, but it\'s gotten a lot better recently. </P> <P>We\'re waiting to see a developmental ped but it could be months, we\'re on a waiting list. I\'m not coping. I\'m on other forums - mostly parenting ones - and it\'s so hard seeing other children who were born the same month she was due doing things I can\'t even vaguely imagine. They\'re running around, talking in sentences, toilet training. She falls over every few steps, doesn\'t even call me \'Mum\', and has no awareness of when she needs a change, let alone when she\'s going to soil herself. I don\'t feel like I have anyone to talk to at all. </P> <P>I\'m constantly guilty about wanting a \'normal\' child. Every day I wake up and just hope she\'s normal. I would kill for typical 2 year old tantrums and yelling matches in the supermarket. I love her to bits, but some days it\'s just so hard. I left my husband in August and he doesn\'t bother to see or call her, and has no idea what it\'s like to parent her. As she gets more independent, the problems are getting harder and harder and I just have no one to talk to. </P> <P> </P> <P>Please tell me someone else has been in the same situation?</P>'

But giving a diagnosis at 9 months could be a little misunderstood. Sometimes you can go to four different doctors and get four different answers.

I don\'t know, I guess time will just tell. But mother know when something is not right. And when you have been trained to look for things that are not normal, I think it is a lot easier to say what you think your child might be developing. It will be interesting to see how this is tested. I think that there are some 9 month olds that you could maybe say, yes, they are showing signs, but then others it could be hard to tell, because the spectrum is so big.</FONT></SPAN></P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Private tutor.

'<P>Hopefully, the entire \"back-off\" from Abilify was supervised by the doctor. 3 weeks is the time it takes for Abilify to leave the system and 3 weeks is the amount if time it will take for the Abilify to be fully in place again. A gag reflex is sensory. Some kids are able to swallow pills better if the pills is in a spoonful of pudding. The pudding protects the throat from the feeling of the pill. For years my son took Risperdal (similar med) CRUSHED. You\'re not supposed to do this, but it was better than taking him off due to his inability to properly swallow it. Fortunately, when he got older he was better able to swallow pills.</P> <P>One of the things that bothers me A LOT about the medication issue is that many people are SO against medication that it makes those of us who have chosen to use medication feel very, very guilty. No one makes the parent of a diabetic feel guilty about giving them insulin by needle. Many of our kids have issues of not having the proper chemistry in their brains and medication can resolve this. Meds are not \"the last resort\" for \"bad boys.\" I realize that in this case, it was your son who chose to not take his meds. This is common. The adults in his life need to work with him so he understands how important his medications are. Like the BP example. In this day and age, we are BLESSED to have the option of safe, effective medications. And I am one who believes giving a child medication that helps him so much is a GOOD thing and should never be perceived as some sort of failure on the part of the parent or the child. Meds are just one more tool - not morally better or worse than any other (like ABA or BIPs or OT). JMHO.</P>'
'Retarded is not an epithet. It means a child\'s tested IQ score is 60 or below. Retardation as measured by IQ scores is present in many, many autistic kids, though retardation is not required for any of the ASD diagnoses. The only ASD kids who appear to be exempt from the possibility of having a low IQ are Asperger\'s kids. I have never heard of an Aspie with an IQ below 70. However, there are many autistic kids and PDD-NOS kids who DO have IQ scores in the retarded range. The word retarded simply means slow. I did not and do not mean it any any pejorative way.'

(I\'m no longer an ECEoftheFuture, and instead an ECE of now!)<br><br>I think any of the jobs you listed would be great and fulfilling. I am currently in a Occupational Therapy program and I love it. The program itself is not focused on working with children, it\'s only one element, but with my degree in early childhood education, i\'m sure working with children is where I will end up. <br><br>A little information on the OT thing. You now need to have a masters level degree in order to be an OT (this is true in Canada, where I live, and i\'m pretty sure it\'s true for the states as well, but you\'d have to double check) so it would take some time if you need to finish college first. That being said it is a fantastic career path, with about a million possible practice areas. There is also a shortage of OT\'s right now, and with the growing trend of hiring OT\"s to working with children who have Autism, the field is just exploding. Basically there is a lot of job opportunities and security in the field so I would highly recommend it. <br><br>If you have any more questions, let me know. <br><br>Natalie<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Natalie- Hoping to help your children someday (considering a possible career in OT?

'Gee, my PDD-NOS son has ALWAYS wanted to make friends. In fact, one of his obsessions is friends and their families and their pets and their names and their middle names and their phone numbers, etc. He LOVES people. He just doesn\'t really know how to deal with them. Or, more accurately, he deals with them in a very immature way. Still, he\'s ALWAYS loved people. BTW, all through his preschool years, he just had \"autistic tendencies\" and that was enough to get him whatever services he needed. By 5, I wanted an official diagnosis because I thought it might eventually help in school. I took him to a well-known autism psychiatrist around here. He did not feel comfortable giving him the diagnosis yet. We were getting all the services, so I didn\'t worry. I went back the next year, when DS was 6, and he got the official diagnosis then.

'You know that with autism there is often a deficit in the executive thinking skills. So she may have trouble with understanding how to do it. Things that may help are pictures on the toy bins to show what goes in to each toy bin, a picture of the shelf or closet showing everything put away, step by step instructions (in pictures is awesome), and removing almost all the toys except for 2 or 3 bins of toys so there isn\'t so much to be overwhelmed by. You could have a \"toy library\" somewhere in the house and trade out bins of toys. I hope that is helpful.'
'My son has PDD and Tourette\'s. He was prescribed Clonodine which helped calm him down but didn\'t address the tics. My son was then prescribed Risperdal which helped with his aggression and his tics until he hit puberty. At around 11 his tics became a major issue. They sound like a cough. We couldn\'t even go out in public without someone commenting that sick children should stay home. Our son\'s psychiatrist referred us to a neurologist who prescribed Topamax, a seizure medication that is also used to treat migranes. The tics are sometimes there but I would say that we have seen a 90% improvement.'

'<P>You have to determine the function of the hitting in order to determine how to react. There\'s a way to do this, but it requires cold observation. Emotions can\'t be involved. Of course, it\'s hard to keep from being emotional when one of your children is being hurt by the other. However, the reason for the hitting will determine how to handle the hitting, so it\'s worth trying to do. The ABC method is this. YOu write down what happened right before the hitting and write down what happened right after the hitting. (Antecedent, Behavior, Consquence). So if right before the hitting you were on the phone and right after the hitting you got off to reprimand your child, chances are your child wanted your attention and then you gave it to him after he hit. Of course, you can\'t stay on the phone while he\'s hitting, but if you find out that he\'s hitting to get attention, you can arrange things so the baby is way out of his way when you are not able to give him that attention. However, if you say, \"pick up your toy\" and then he hits the baby and then you put him in his room, his hitting was likely a way to escape the chore he didn\'t want to do - picking up his toys. While he\'s banished, he can\'t pick up his toys. You get the idea. </P> <P>Most ASD kids have very sensitive hearing and cannot stand a loud voice. When your son hits, you can grab him, look him straight in the face and yell \"no hitting\" at him. Then, put him in a chair or his room for a minute per year of age. Or for a count to 10 or 50 if that\'s too long. The idea is to impose some kind of banishment. Of course, you have to take the reason for the hitting into consideration when you apply a punishment as consequence, but you may be able to avoid some hitting by figuring out the reason for the hitting in the first place and setting up the situation so as to avoid hitting if at all possible.</P> <P>If your son is able to understand earning a reward, you can give him points or stars or stickers or checks for catching him doing good things. If he gets a certain number of those things, he can earn a treat. As punishment, it\'s possible to take one away. Not everyone agrees with the taking-a-star-away tactic, but it is very powerful and hitting is dangerous, so using it as punishment for hitting may be the time to do something like that. When my son was little, I learned this from his kindergarten teacher and used it at home: Divide an index card into 20 spaces. Each time the child does something good (even something little that\'s good), draw a star in the space. When he\'s earned 20 stars, he gets to choose something from the \"treasure box.\" You can accumulate a box full of small treats like stickers or tiny toys or small snacks. You can regulate how quickly your child earns the stars. On difficult days you may have to have him earn his stars more frequently so as to help him focus on the good things he\'s doing. Hitting could be the one thing he loses a star for. Write them in pencil so they can be erased, but rarely erase one. Just for hitting sounds about right. One of the great side-effects of this system is that it forces us parents to LOOK for good behavior. In the beginning, your child should probably be getting 20 stars in one day. You can increase the distance between stars as rewards as he gets used to the system. </P>'

'<P>We took him off all milk product from about birth to 1 1/2 years old. Then slowly introduced cheese items, ice cream and various other things. He seemed to do okay with these items so far. He does seem to be bothered by soy if it is a mix of soy and milk in processed foods. </P> <P> My other big issue is that I cannot get him to eat chewable vitamins so I try to dissolve them in his juice. It is going along with his pickiness of what he will eat. He will not try anything. He is a chicken nugget, juice, rice, bread kid. All the things that make him constipated of course. The doc that is not listening keeps telling me to get him to eat fruit and things that start with \"P\" to make him poop. I tried to explain that if he would try them then that would be great. The doc is not getting the severity of the problem. We will have food on our walls if it is out of Jax\'s taste range. The doc told me to make him a meal and if he does not eat that meal wrap it up and bring it back out again the next meal and so on. He said sooner or later he will get hungry and eat it. I tried it for like 2 - 3 days. Then I thought this is rediculous. I don\'t even like to eat left overs like that when they have been reheated and reheated. Of course Jax would rather starve himself than eat it. I just opted to try to let Jax pick things out shopping even if he just liked the packaging. Then I began to allow him to look in the fridge and pull things out open them and taste them if he wanted. Generally this begins a mess and he generally does not like much. I think he does it more to play and have sensory time with the food textures. My hopes are he will find something one day and totally surprise me. We did get something new in the diet this past week. I began to make bacon on toast sandwiches. Normally he will not touch breakfast but he is really tough to deal with when he is hungry. So I cut them up all pretty and he actually is eating those. Granted we have to have the same thing each morning for breakfast but oh well. It is eating and it is one meal he did not do before. To me that is progress!</P> <P>Anyways, I could go on and on. It is so nice to finally find a place where I can talk with people that understand what is going on. I just kept thinking I must be a crappy parent. </P> <P>Thanks a ton,</P> <P>Suns</P>'

'<P>I spent the weekend with my autisic nephew. My sister in law is a social worker and works with all kinds of special children. He is 10 and we have been aware since he was a baby. We spend lots of weekend togeather . He is concidered high functioning and attends a regular school. </P> <P>I had an incidance where I took him the car by myself. It was a busy parking lot so i had him enter from the drivers side rather than the passenger side as he usually does. It freaked him out. Now as a father of two normal kids, my reaction is not to give in to tantrums. He did get in the car and started to melt down. I was able to distract him and things leveled out. </P> <P>The problem that I am stuck with and brought me here is that I do not understand the diability. We have been lead to believe that though extra work and socialization, he will get better. We should treat him like every other kid. In reality he will never be like other kids, and I could be more help if I were tought to understand him more. I belive there is a certian denial that keeps her from educating those close by. I think that throgh sites like this I can learn to modifie my parenting skills to give her a break. I am one of the only adults in thier very large family that will inter act with him. I think everyone else is afraid, due to the lack of guidance. </P> <P>Is this common among parents of autistic children? How have succsesful families handled it? Do i approch her and explain my feelings, or would this add to her situation. Do I get involved to educate others in the family? It seems like she is going it alone, (her husband is very god with him, but will always defer to her). any insite would be helpfull. </P>'

'<P>I was watching a show on Feral Children on TLC (they are going to show again tonight) and I was wondering if ds\'s problems may be my fault. I\'ve had a nagging feeling for quite sometime that this is my fault. Maybe the fact that his language is not properly developing is my fault? I\'m a quiet person by nature and maybe I just haven\'t talked enough to him as he\'s grown. I\'m very affectionate, and maybe that\'s why he has no problem giving and receiving hugs and kisses and I even caught him voluntarily patting his little sister on the head and then giving her a kiss. Maybe his intense fascination with numbers and letters is my fault? When we color together MY DRAWINGS and such lack imagination, and maybe I focused to much on numbers and letters? I thought I was doing it (numbers and letters) because he enjoyed it. He can read over a hundred words that I know of and if he hasn\'t seen a word before he tries to sound it out. His brain shouldn\'t be ready to do this right? When he was younger I did try to read to him but he would just take the book from me and run off. I used to sit on the floor and try to play with toys with him and maybe it was ME who lacked imaginitive play and he just didn\'t learn from me. I am an only child who didn\'t have any one to play with and my social skills are lacking (I\'m very shy) so maybe my problems are rubbing off on him. Thank goodness he\'s started school and is getting a ton of interaction from other children and his teachers because obviously I just don\'t cut it. Even now, <EM>that I know</EM> that I have to talk about everything I do and label everything as I walk through the house and changing diapers, etc, so that ds can learn language, it takes everything I have just to do that because it feels so unnatural. </P> <P>Maybe I\'m just one of those \"cold\" mothers that screw up their kids? That theory has been disproved, right? Even if this is my fault, I didn\'t do it intentionally. </P> <P>I\'m not saying that all autistic kids are the fault of their mothers so please don\'t think that....I\'m just talking about MINE because of the way I am. But... kids with drug addict mothers usually learn language well, but maybe that\'s because they are running with a pack of other neglected kids and they just nuture each other. My son only has me (dh just watches tv when he comes home from work). Ds watches a lot of videos because I use them as a babysitter while I shower and do dishes because I know he will be safe if he\'s stuck to the tv. </P> <P>Does anyone else ever feel this way?</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mommy to Noah (4 - autism) and Sarah (2)</div>'
'We took our son to the feeding clinic at a local children\'s hospital for an evaluation when he was 2 1/2. The appointment took several hours- he was assessed by a pediatrician, psychologist, speech therapist, occupational therapist, nutritionist. They mostly asked us questions but they also observed us feeding him his favorite snacks and later they offer him some other foods to see how he would react. They in no way tried to force him to eat. In our case, we decided not to continue with ongoing treatment because they felt that he was getting adequate nutrition even though his diet was very limited and they did not think there were any medical issues that needed to be addressed (reflux, swallowing problems, etc). They knew that we were working on many other things (speech, coping skills, sensory regulation) and understood that we were maxed out. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- -Amber, mom to Elijah (age 5, ASD and epilepsy)</div>'

I sometimes think she doesnt inwardly regress-it just kind of stays dormant. Then, when she progresses outwardly again-it\'s like wildfire. She regresses both behaviorally and cognitively, but then comes back, twofold.</P> <P>Colin never regressed.

'<P>Not that I am recommending this, but I have heard of some parents doing things that they know will set their child off before the eval. Again, I\'m not sure I\'d want to do that - I was fortunate (I guess) that my son was in a rotten mood the day of his eval. He too, has really good days where I think that he is just totally NT. But the last month or so has been a wake-up call and I don\'t think I\'ll think that again - horrible meltdowns and out-of-control stuff that I have never seen before. It has to do with him starting ECSE and so far he doesn\'t like it. He didn\'t like his mainstream pre-school last year when he started either and now he simply LOVES it this year. So, we are waiting to give it a chance and monitoring him closely. He didn\'t have these kind of meltdowns last year so we are working with a psychologist and they are slowly but surely getting better.</P> <P>Anyway, like others have said a GOOD evaluator will look at the whole picture. Our dev ped looked at all his school evaluations - which were done over the course of the month in school, in an office and at our house. Plus, he looked at what my son was able to do in the office. He definitely saw some behaviors and gave us a PDD-NOS diagnosis. Most docs wouldn\'t have, he said, because my son just doesn\'t fit into any one slot. He doesn\'t meet all the criteria for either HFA or Asperger\'s and he is somewhere in between, but on the mild end. However, our doc said that when you get early intervention, the child has much more of a chance for progress. So, he gave the diagnosis - hurray for at least one doc! </P> <P>I would also videotape behaviors that you want the ped to see - we did that and I think that that helped make our case as well. I would also check to make sure that you won\'t be denied insurance coverage if you DO get a diagnosis. If insurance won\'t cover you, you need to make sure that you can qualify for state help or something like Medicaid. There are some insurance companies who will flat out deny any coverage for kids with autism. Horrible, I know - but it does happen. You can fight it after, but you might want to look into it before you get a diagnosis so that you are prepared ahead of time. </P> <P>Hope this helps!</P>'

'<P>I think someday we will find out it is not so much a line from severe on one end to high functioning on the other, but more of a big area chart, and that kids can not easily be fit into \"Autism\" or \"Aspergers\" or whatever else.

One Dr (a specialist in LD and ASD) said my son did not have Aspergers, but would call it PDDNOS, another (psychiatrist) uses the terms interchangeably.</P> <P>My son did have severe, pervasive developmental delays, which is not typical of Aspergers, yet at the same time posseses many/most Aspergers/Autistic behaviors and characteristics, but mildly. He continues to have difficulty educationally and easily qualifies for Spec ed - his IQ is pretty high, his performance not so good. He is less severe than Autism, but more delayed than Aspergers. </P> <P>I honestly believe that they are only beginning to find out everything about this disorder and that someday the current categories will be gone and replaced with more appropriate ones. Right now there is not one for my son, he is somewhere across categories. And PDDNOS is not widely known about by the public or teachers, our school does not even recognize it as legit.

'<P>My son has been in the psychiatric ER and they did NOTHING. We took him there a couple of summers ago by ambulance. We were at a small lake we are members of and, for some reason totally unknown to me to this day, he started to get very, very violent with me. He pulled me by my hair to the ground repeatedly. He was 13 at the time and about my same size. But the rage made him VERY strong. I was shaking with fear. I got my friends to call my DH and, eventually, the police. We just needed some extra strong hands to handle our son if necessary. Since I was far too shaken to drive him anywhere (what if he jumped me while I was driving? Or even if he went in the car with DH, he could jump HIM to, and neither one of us could stop him). It was the weekend, so we couldn\'t contact DS\'s psychiatrist. We decided to take him to the hospital via ambulance. Well, DH and I sat in our cold bathing suits for 2 hours there. The ambulance people had been SO nice to DS, he was happy as a clam when he got to ER. He sat in an isolation room where they observed him. Then they called us in to talk. They said they saw no problem at all but that based on our description of what happened, DS needed more meds. They wouldn\'t give him more meds since he ws stable at that point and just told us to call his psychiatrist\'s office to get an emergency appt. Of course, we couldn\'t do that until Monday. DS was fine the rest of the weekend until we could get into the doctor and get a raise in medication. As far as I\'m concerned, psychiatric ER is a waste unless it\'s used for your safety. Actually, there IS a Crisis Team here and they will take him to their Crisis House overnight or for a few days. But on the weekends, especially in the summer when routines are out the window, their crisis house is often full - and it was full that day at the lake. However, DS has gone there once during the day and once for an overnight. He HATES going there. There\'s nothing wrong with the place - it\'s a suburban house with TV and counselors and plenty to eat - but he KNOWS he\'s been banished. Since that overnight stay, all I have to do is mention the place and DS uses every bit of his own strength to get himself under control. I HATE to do that and only do if I sense danger (which is very rare now), but I would not hestitate to call them again. </P> <P>It sounds to me as though your son needs to be seen by a good psychiatrist who is familiar with ASD. ASD kids react differently to all sorts of medications. He may need an increase in what he\'s taking now, another med or a combination of meds. Perhaps this particular incident was caused by unavoidable stress, but he has been having lots of bad incidents lately. He needs to be seen by a doctor.</P>'

'<P>It does get easier. At least it did for me. I remember when my son was 3-4 years old and everything was a struggle and a fight. Simple acts like getting dressed were not simple acts at our house - it always involved a chase and a struggle.

'I would talk to the special ed teacher and the occupational therapist. They need to be able to help you with this. It\'s not enough for them to sit back and say you\'ll get services as long as your son shows up-they\'ve got to help you get him through the door if that is the initial problem. Don\'t feel back about telling them about this. If they know anything about autism, they will have dealt with this before. I know how excrutiating it is for you-and it is also embarassing-I had to go to urgent care once with both boys and while the doctor was examining me, they were completely trashing the room and being loud. DH was on his way to help, but since it was a sudden thing around rush hour, it took him awhile. The crazy thing was that all the medical staff just looked like deer in headlights and expected me to take control when I was the patient in pain! So they were screaming and I was trying to get them to do things, but I couldn\'t pick them up. Oh, it was just terrible. Just try to reassure him at preschool when you drop him off (i.e. peel him off of you kicking and screaming) and then leave. Make sure the teachers are there prepared for him to bolt. It\'s going to be painful the first few times, but I\'m optimistic that things will get better for him and for you. Hang in there. <br />Nowwhat'

'<P>Hi I\'m Christina. I have a son who was diagnosed by an OT as having SPD, FTT &amp; an unspecified nuerological disorder. She initially said she felt like he did not have autism, but since spending time with him, she thinks we should NOT rule out mild autism. I\'m unsure what to do.</P> <P>I have talked about this in a previous post, but he is VERY social and is meeting all of his developmental milestones, in fact, he is excelling in many areas. He is very good at communicating and the OT agrees with me on that and says he is very lucky to be able to communicate his needs so well to me. (He\'s just a chatter box and has excellent speech.) He has a lot of OCD like behaviors and lines up all of his toys, but he also plays with them. He plays pretend with his siblings and enjoys socializing. He does have a big need for order and is upset if things are not going his way. The OT thinks that as he gets older (he\'s currently just about to turn 3, next week) we will start to see more social problems because currently I don\'t see social problems with him. She thinks that as he gets into school that his rigid ways will be tested and he will have a hard time with the other kids \'messing up\' his things. </P> <P>Did anyone else feel like their child\'s social issues got worse as they got older? People are telling me that they do not see any autistic qualities in him. And I even have one person almost mad at me for considering it, which is not what I need. I feel really lost and unsupported. He just doesn\'t fit that mold of autism, but he\'s also got something going and maybe it\'s just the SPD, but I don\'t know. All I know is that my extended family thinks there is absolutely not a single thing going on with him and they are not supporting me at all, with my search for answers. He is so much better ouside of the home, than when at home. He,also, plays fine at other friend\'s homes, but does not like them to come to his home. He says it\'s \'scary because they will move his toys\'. </P> <P>Anyway, I\'m just trying to get answers for my little guy. Did anyone notice decline in their kid\'s behaviors with vaccinations? I have noticed significant differences after each set of shots and it has been really upsetting. I know my doc doesn\'t agree with me. I wont vaccinate again, ever. I feel like my little guy\'s body just can\'t handle it. I regret vaccinating him. </P>'

This syndrome acts so much like ADS,PDD and the like that you have to look into it and rule it out. These kids DO improve as they get older. Not 100% dont get me wrong but as the yrs. have passed I NEVER thought Id see my child where he is today.

'<P>OK, I\'m not angry today, just frustrated. I took my son to his regualr dentist on July 1. They took Xrays (that took about 30 min since he didn\'t like the thing in his mouth and kept taking it out) of his broken tooth and told me that he should have a root canal since the cavity in the broken tooth is so close to the nerve. This dentist wants to spare my son the pain of waking up in the middle of the night with a toothache (I\'ve had my share of those, not fun). So since he will eventually need a rootcanal she believes it\'s better to do it now rather than when he\'s in pain. I\'ve been going to this dentist for years. She has never pushed unnecessary dental work, she has always done the \"least\" amount of work as possible. </P> <P>Anyway she refers me to a practice where they were going to take Xrays and perform the rootcanal. Problem was they couldn\'t get good Xrays. I\'m watching the dentist peek in to see if the hygentists are done or not. He really seemed like he was on a tight schedule. After 30 minutes and three hygentist the dentist comes in and says, \"We tried, I think he needs to be sedated laughing gas won\'t be enough since he can\'t get through Xrays. He probably doesn\'t need a root canal since it doesn\'t hurt. Here\'s a phone number of someone who sedates, good luck...that will be $125.\" They billed my insurance as a consultation, I have to pay my copay of $25 which I\'m a little annoyed at because it wasn\'t a consulatation as they billed my insurance. IT was a failed attempt at a root canal. They didn\'t get a set of Xrays and discuss my options. They told me they couldn\'t help me. I would have argued with them if my son wasn\'t with me. He was already very anxious and coughing/clearing his throat from his Tourette\'s. If I complain to my insurance then I just have to pay the $125 since I already signed all the papers stating I would pay for whatever the insurance doesn\'t cover.</P> <P>My biggest concern is who is going to treat him? I called the number that he gave me and they don\'t do rootcanals on permanent teeth. My dentist is away and I\'ll explain everything when she gets back but for now we\'re in limbo. <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley18.gif\" border=\"0\"></P> <P>Has anyone had any similar dental issues??? </P>'

I was nervous about the line that Collin would have a breakdown from all the noise.

Anyways it was a really good thing though because there was only two families in front of us and none behind us because the line was closed. Towards the front of the line Collin started stimming pretty bad running in circles, making noises, ect ect. At one point he even pulled his pants all the way down <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley5.gif\" border=\"0\">, and uh yea plenty of ppl saw that. <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley36.gif\" border=\"0\"> But he was actually excited about seeing santa, I dont think he quite understood who he was or what was going on but still lol.

There is someone in a booth actually talking to the children as \"chester\" well we walked up to see chester and there was a younger man maybe a older teen standing there talking to chester. I knew from first sight he probably had some form of Autism. I thought oh cool lol. So Collin was really excited about chester and was trying to talk to him/her but chester couldnt understand him lol. So I was trying to get my daughter to talk to chester (she is my loud kid by the way) and she was \"acting\" shy. So chester says to her \"im not that scary am I\" and the man looks at Novaly and says there is no reason to be scared or shy. And then looks at chester and says \"chester sometimes being shy is a good thing\" He was really involved with getting the kids to talk to chester and I really enjoyed him. Then I looked over and a mom with her son went to talk to chester and after under a minute of standing there I could just see it in her face she was watching the man and immediatly yanked her son away saying \"common we need to go\" (the boy didnt even get to talk to chester) Ugh I hate ppl<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley7.gif\" border=\"0\">.

A special needs child is one who will have unusual behaviour no matter what you do. That child needs to be protected from the lack of understanding of kids.<br><br>In Ontario, family law states that if poor parenting is the reason behind a child committing criminal acts- like say harrassment, Child Protection has the authority to take away that child and place them with a foster family. And such denunciations can be made anonymously.<br><br>You might want to look up what your local jurisdiction says. I suspect that it might be a similar situation in your area. You might want to casually mention that to the parents of said bullies. They might need to know that. I\'m sure they wouldn\'t want the trouble of dealing with a child protection worker and the possible expense of hiring a lawyer to get their kids back.<br><br>I don\'t understand parents who are not embarrassed when they are told their kids are engaging in bullying behaviour. I don\'t get it. I know parents can\'t be everywhere, but a failure to act on that seems to be a failure of basic parenting skills.<br><br><br>ETA: That could be over the top depending on the situation.

'Many people from way out here in Eastern Suffolk commute into the City by train. I used to commute there 3x/wk when my son was little. It\'s about 2 hours each way, but you get to sleep on the train or do bills or just read and relax. Since Eastern Suffolk is further from the City than Great Neck or Oyster Bay (BTW - Oyster Bay is a pain to commute from because there are fewer trains that go that far north), the housing here is cheaper. You might be able to get a 1500 sq ft. house for about $300,000, with property taxes (this includes school taxes and garbage pick up) for around 5 or 6 K. That\'s a small 3 bed, 1.5 bath house without a garage on less than a quarter acre. At least there ARE houses now for around 300K or a bit less. Last year there weren\'t. If your husband works near Penn Sta., the commute will be a cinch. Consider the commuting time and difficulty before you buy. Nowhere within 2 hours\' commute of Midtown is cheaper than Eastern Suffolk. Not Westchester or NJ or upstate NY. The prices only start to go down once you\'re either not near a train station (Orange County, upstate, for example) or you\'re outside of the 2 hour limit (you\'d have to go up past Poughkeepsie, north, to find that). The commutes are expensive, but your X already knows that I guess. The good news is that the spec. ed. services can be excellent if you find out your rights and insist on them.'

'<P>Niki,</P> <P>From what I\'ve seen, most kids around here are off training wheels by end of kindergarten. My kids both point out (to my horror) when other kids still have training wheels. They aren\'t intentionally cruel, they just ask \"why does so-and-so still have training wheels?\" I definitely think it is something that kids will notice, and the older he gets, the more he will be teased. That sucks, but it\'s reality. </P> <P>I posted this a while ago buried in another thread, but I figured it might be a good idea to put it out there again. I know many ASD kids have trouble learning to ride a <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN>, and tis the season for biking (at least here in the USA). Since we did this with the boys last summer, we\'ve passed on this technique to many friends who have all had the same success.</P> <P>My dh read a book on biking with kids and there was a chapter on teaching your child to ride a <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN>. It was a different approach than I had ever seen and I must admit I was a bit skeptical. At the end of last summer dh took training wheels off the <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN>s and had both boys riding two wheelers like pros within 1 - 2 hours. No falls. It was amazing. (Note that C does not have any gross motor issues, his skills in that area are on par with his NT twin.)</P> <P>I\'ll try and summarize the technique.</P> <P>1. Get your own <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN> out and lower the seat so that both of your feet are flat on the ground when your butt is in the seat. Then take the training wheels off of the childs <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN> and lower the seat as low as it will go.</P> <P>2. Show the child how to sit on the seat and pick both feet up off the ground and try to balance. Count out loud how many seconds the child balances with no feet on the ground. Make a game of it. Demonstrate how turning the handebar can help balance. Once the child can balance with both feet off of the ground for 5 seconds, move on to step 3. (You are ignoring pedals throughout this entire step. Feet should be in the air.)</P> <P>3. Show the child how to glide forward on the <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN> by taking \"<SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>giant</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>steps</SPAN></SPAN>.\" This is basically gliding the <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN> forward, butt in seat, by taking <SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>giant</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>steps</SPAN></SPAN> with alternating feet. This is why it is important to start with child\'s seat at lowest level. If seat is too high it is impossible to do this step. Once child is comfortable moving up and down the driveway like this, move on to step 4.</P> <P>4. Have the child take 3 - 4 <SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>giant</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>steps</SPAN></SPAN> to get going, and then have the child pick their feet off the ground like they did in step 2 and glide with feet in the air. Count out loud how many seconds the child glide without their feet on the ground. Make a game of it. (Note, we are still ignoring pedals, feet should be in the air.) Once the child can glide for 8 - 10 seconds without putting a foot on the ground, go on to step 5.</P> <P>5. Have the child take 3 - 4 <SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>giant</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>steps</SPAN></SPAN> to get going, and have them pick their feet up like in step 4 and then tell them to start to pedal! Once they get good at pedaling, start raising the seat up a bit to a normal height.</P> <P>The key to this approach is to get the child comfortable balancing on a <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN> before teaching the child to pedal. The old \"run, push and let go\" technique requires the child to learn to balance and pedal simulaneously and typically results in many falls, which can scare a child and make them not want to try again.</P> <P>I know that tackling the <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN> issue is a big challenge for those with kids who have gross motor issues. It may take a long time to get through the above <SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>steps</SPAN></SPAN>. However I think this approach is really good for ASD kids because it breaks the complex task into simpler skills and then builds on them. It also greatly reduces the risk of falling/injury. </P> <P>If anyone has questions on this or wants to discuss further, please PM me and I can give you my phone number and you can talk to dh. He\'s the resident expert in our home and can probably explain much better than me! I think this is a GREAT process for ASD kids because it breaks it down into simpler steps/skills that can be worked on - much better than the push-run-release-fall method!</P> <P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Kristy  Mom to 10 year old twin boys (1 PDD-NOS, 1 ADHD)</div>'

'As a parent with twins who had speech delays, I can tell you my experience. My dd (with autism), started out with what I called \'purposeful babble\'. It sounded like sentences were being formed but little made sense. At about three, can single words and counting. At four came short sentences. At five things more pragmatic and purposeful speech. She also became more fluent at this age. Today, she has an excellent vocabulary, pronunciation, pragmatic speech. You would not know that she ever had a delay. <br><br>As a parent you can have hope! Do not believe any chapter is closed for your child yet. Progress can take place in a matter of days or years. Be willing for now to set aside the milestone playbook. There were so many things my dd could not do at age three that she can today (go to school, eat in a restaurant, have a meaningful conversation, travel across country on a plane, the list goes on). <br><br>I encourage you to keep doing the best you can, watch for growth with receptive language (very important) and give him alternative opportunities for communication. For example, when my dd used to get upset and have meltdowns, I taught her to draw pictures of her emotions, and she learned to use that as an outlet until she could express herself better with words. Read to him a lot; I used to read a lot of Dr. Seuss, it seemed to put language in a pattern that she was receptive to.

'We\'re still struggling with the same thing you are, but I can try to offer a few tips on things that worked for us. We try to go to places where there won\'t be much waiting. If possible you can call ahead of time to order, and reserve a table. If they say they don\'t take reservations maybe they\'d make an exception if you told them your situation. We also try to go eat on off hrs, like at 4 pm intstead of 6 pm. That way if things get out of hand it doesn\'t feel like we\'re disrupting the whole resaurant. I try to take a snack with me too, that way they can eat while they\'re waiting. Usually, one of the boys needs to go outside with me or my dh to walk around. We end up having to take turns eating.

She played beside other kids, not as much with them, which I couldn\'t see. Even when the doc diagnosed her, we used meds to help with some symptoms, but I didn\'t see the full picture. I wasn\'t even sure I believed it. No one told me about an IEP, no one told me about a behavior plan, no one told me about social skills, or the waiver, or any services that were available.

'<P>Fred,</P> <P>He is a Immuniologist and on the DAN board of doctors. He came highly recommended by the parents in our city. I knew if I was to put my poor child through any diet, or biomedical protocol I had to have proof she needed them. This doctor also has a son with autism-adult now that still remains GFCf all the time and claims he is foggy when he gets something GFCF. He took vials of blood and stool &amp;urine (did these at home:P). Insurance paid for most..I think 70% and we paid out of pocket for the rest. This immunologist was the most compassionate and caring, calm doctor I have ever known.. he let us (me &amp; husband) talk out all our fears and anxieties for over an hour and he totally listened! He gave us advice on ABA and gave me a folder with chunks of information on books to read, parents groups, online support and which health food stores carry the GFCF diet and supplements. He was the only doctor willing to help us with positive information and actually had many things we could do with her at home. When the labs came back on Sarah it was almost a book! Many things were off in her compared to normal levels. I would have to dig it up now but it came from Great Plains Laboratory..they have a website listing all the things they check for. I didn\'t want to be one of those moms that did the whole 9 yards without scientific evidence:) This doctor has helped many parents here. He was truely interesting in helping Sarah and so sweet with her trying to engage her. When it came time to collect blood..he did it himself with his nurse-this was a rare event for me to see a doctor collect blood on a screaming child! He was so calm. He always encourages us to visit for free to see her progress. I never felt he was scamming us...he was very thorough in explaining all the components that are different in most of our kids-mainly gut issues and food issues. He respected our wishes when we declined to do B12 shots and secretin. With all things that DAN docs do.. the problems is that some kids respond amazingly and some not at all. My friends daughter started speaking long sentences like crazy from taking ambrotose... but the diet didn\'t do much..she still has gut issues and stays away from milk products or she will tell you \"mommy my tummy hurts!\" everytime she gets milk type foods in her. After a year on diet with Sarah she got a cookie by accident and we freaked she would regress but she didn\'t and a few more wheat/milk products over a weeks time and we noticed nothing. I learned that some kids gut actually heals and that is why she wasn\'t showing any behaviors or regression. She still at times can have milk and get spacey. I try to limit it..especially when she craves it all the time. I hope you can find a good doctor..ask other parents around you that use one...they will tell you which are in it for money and those that really care. Good luck!</P> <P>BLessings,</P> <P>Shelley</P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by ShelleyR on February 12 2007 at 5:33pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>-      Sarah~8 yrs. old 7/27/00 Pdd/hyperlexia  Stephanie~17(nt)</div>'

The purpose of this 3-year naturalistic study (March 1999-April 2002) is to describe the clinical outcome of a consecutive sample of preschool children with PDD treated with risperidone monotherapy. METHOD: The sample consisted of 45 boys and 8 girls aged 3.6 to 6.6 years (mean +/- SD age = 4.6 +/- 0.7 years) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder or PDD, not otherwise specified. Outcome measures included the Children\'s Psychiatric Rating Scale (CPRS), Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale (CGI-I), Children\'s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS), and a checklist for risperidone side effects. RESULTS: Patients received risperidone for a period ranging from 1 to 32 months (7.9 +/- 6.8 months). Twenty-five patients (47.2%) continued to receive risperidone after the study was completed, while 28 (52.8%) discontinued due to side effects (22.6% [N = 12]), parents\' choice (18.9% [N = 10]), lack of efficacy (5.7% [N = 3]), and decision of the treating psychiatrist (5.7% [N = 3]). The optimal dose was 0.55 +/- 0.2 mg/ day. Significant improvement at the last observation was found in CPRS (p &lt; .0001) and CGAS (p &lt; .0001) scores. On the basis of both an improvement of 25% in CPRS score and a score of 1 or 2 on the CGI-I, 46.8% (N = 22) of subjects were considered responders. Behavioral disorders and affect dysregulation were more sensitive to treatment than was interpersonal functioning. Responders received higher doses of medication for a longer period and had a greater weight gain than did nonresponders. Increased prolactin levels without clinical signs (65% [24 of 37]) and increased appetite (15% [8 of 531) were the most frequent side effects. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that low-dose risperidone may positively affect the clinical outcome in young children with PDD not only in the short-term, but also in the long-term period.<BR><BR>PMID: 14628979 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=3></FONT> </P> <P><FONT size=3></FONT> </P> <P><FONT size=3>SORRY-I THINK I AM EXCITED!</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=3>KATE</FONT></P> <P> </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- 7 y.o.

'<P>Like Amber said, it does differ from child to child, however there are things you can do to encourage receptive language. PECS and eventually social stories comes to mind as in encouraging language development. There is a book called More than Words. I think it costs around $50 on Amazon and it tells you the different stages in language/ social communication developmnet. In order for the child to get to the receptive language, he must accomplished other obstacles in language development. The book offers great tips and methods in encouraging communication b/w you and the child. I know there are other books out there, but this book was very helpful to me and was recommended to us by various professionals. </P> <P>I also want to add that my daughter is very receptive to music. We used that as our basic tool to get her to learn words/ phrases and to eventually communicate. We sung everything - Clean up song, potty song, bathtime song, throwing stuff in trash song, stop (while she is running away in the mall) song, feed the duck song, grocery shopping song, paying the cashier song, being gentle to her little brother song, etc. I can say that our singing voices improved over the last year...I have reached notes that I never thought I could sing<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley36.gif\" border=\"0\"></P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by little byrd on August 11 2005 at 5:17am</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>-    Jenni</div>'

One of the things I thought would be scary but was actually fun.. I took my kids to an art museum on one of the family days. They had lots of activities geared for kids and my kids had an amazing time. My dd also likes the Dole Pineapple maze (it makes her feel like she is in the Amazing Race); however, I am not sure if the draw is the maze or the pineapple icecream afterwards. We have also done some hiking and some botanical gardens. I find that my dd is very open now to new experiences..my son on the otherhand<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley7.gif\" border=\"0\">.'

'Katherine, sounds like you found an ideal specialist. Thanks for offering so much info. I hope your son is doing well in the program. Pam, now you can see why we are thoroughly confused! After 3 psychologists, 1 ped. neurologist, 1 devel pediatrician we are still confused. We do have another appt with a neuropsychologist who\'s speciality is to determine misdiagnosed kids - kids who are erroneously labeled OCD, Bipolar, ADHD, or Aspergers. She is the author of the book I spoke of that states lack of empathy is what distinguishes the Aspergers kids, at least on the sociability aspect. But now that you say your own son is quite sympathetic, I feel like whereever I search for answers, I hit a dead end. I am scared that time might run out for early intervention but I\'m trying to look everywhere for that truly qualified PDD expert. I have a friend whose son was pretty antisocial and had OCD, and she took him for a PDD eval at NIH when they were doing a study. They told her her son didn\'t have PDD because he engaged the doctor in play. This was precisely what I was told brings a child out of the spectrum too. Yet the author Nadia Webb wrote in her book that an Aspergers child can engage someone in play or conversation ad nauseum if it\'s a topic of HIS choice. Once the topic changes to something not necessarily of his interest, he refuses to maintain the social reciprocity/conversation. Or if the child is a little older, once they sense that the other person isn\'t at all interested in their obsession, they change the topic or respond accordingly, and Aspergers kids can\'t tell this. My gosh, there is so much to this area and I\'m getting the picture that lots of clinicians don\'t know this area well either.'
'<FONT size=1>Parent_Nos, you have no idea how most autistics feel. I chat with lots of them and they aren\'t as upset about being autistic as how hard others try to make them change. You can\'t, and, as your child grows, I think you will see that it\'s NOT a tragedy-merely a difference. It may be YOUR tradegy (hopes, dreams, etc), but not the person\'s. Of course, the child will be less happy if those he/she loves are trying to force her to do something that is foreign to her. That would be as stressful as typical folks trying very hard all the time to understand and to be autistic. We\'d have to monitor our every move all the time and basically go through life\'s motions without understanding what we were doing-or understanding it, but not relating to it.

'I change my mind about this everyday, but most days, this is the behavior I wish I could make go away in our son. He scripts for only a few minutes most of the time, and it\'s often in context (Thomas scripts when playing with trains, Once Upon a Potty Scripts when sitting on the potty, etc.). But when it\'s out of context and he\'s \"unreachable\" it\'s just sad. Also, he tends to greet new people with a barrage of echolalia. Very embarrassing!<br> <br> We start speech therapy next week and this is certainly one of the first things I\'ll be talking to them about. We\'ll let you know of any techniques we learn over time. We\'re desperately hoping he can turn his echolalia into real language, but it does seem like a stim for him, so only time will tell.<br> <br> We used to try to interact with the echolalia, but that rarely works unless we\'re simply filling in holes in the script. Lately, we\'ve been SERIOUSLY rewarding \"good\" speech and ignoring the stuff we don\'t like or saying \"that makes me uncomfortable\" when he gets loud or manic about the scripting.

'Hi my son is 3 1/2. He gets minimal therapy right now. He too, is a very picky eater. Only 5 or 6 things. He has pretty severe language delays and most other \"typical\" issues as well as some more severe physical issues. He is progressing. Learning words, learning to communicate with me. Engaging others. It\'s been something new almost every day for the past few months. If he had been on a special diet or taken lots of supplements or had tons of therapy, I would have to guess what to attribute the progress to. He might be progressing quicker with more, but he is happy, I am happy. I don\'t feel the need to add in tons of other things in our life right now. It is such a personal decision as there is no \"sure thing\". All kids will react different to different interventions. If your Dr. thinks he has food allergy problems, that is a whole different ball game, in my opinion, and has to be treated as any medical condition. Anyway, do what you think is best for your child. As far as I know there is no magic out there. No, you are not a bad mother. You are, as we all are, learning, asking questions, seeking out new things to help our kids.

Those caveats help explain why the stat, while alarming, doesn\'t support related claims by some advocates: that autism cases have been mushrooming with \"epidemic speed,\" and that more than one million Americans have autism. <BR><BR>First, the stat comes from figures published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on a review of several studies that came up with estimates. But the CDC was careful to point out that the studies produced a wide range of results. Indeed, the headline-grabbing number focuses on the worst-case scenario: The CDC said the number of children with autism was somewhere between one in 500 and one in 166. <BR><BR>Second, the numbers take into account a relatively modern definition of autism that includes a full range of disorders. <strong>The changing definition of autism has played a major role in influencing statistics. <BR></strong><BR>The cause of autism isn\'t completely understood; a combination of genetic and environmental factors is believed to play a part, according to the CDC. Autism can usually be diagnosed before the age of three, according to the National Institute of Health. Different from mental retardation, autistic disorders (as they are now defined) are characterized by impairment in communication and other social interaction. Mental retardation, characterized in part by a low intelligence-test score, can coincide with autism, but some people with autism have above-average IQs. <BR><BR>Those with \"high-functioning autism\" or with Asperger\'s Disorder - distinguished by less-severe symptoms that may not become apparent until later in life - are likely to have an easier time of adapting to mainstream society, and therefore their conditions can be more difficult to diagnose. Other people with more severe cases of autism may require special education throughout school years and may have difficulty living independently as adults. <BR><BR>The broad definition used to arrive at the one-in-166 figure, which includes milder forms like Asperger\'s syndrome, was published by the American Psychiatric Association in 1994 in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, known as the DSM-IV - the primary handbook for diagnosing mental disorders. <BR><BR>Eric Fombonne, an autism expert at Montreal\'s McGill University, told me that while about a dozen studies around the world have found autism prevalence rates that would be in line with the one-in-166 estimate, that same research found that the majority of those people had a mild form of the condition. <BR><BR>The high profile of the one-in-166 number has been driven by increased public-awareness campaigns about autism from the government and advocacy groups. In 2004, the CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups issued an alert (Autism A.L.A.R.M.) to doctors citing the 1-in-166 stat and advising on how to screen for cases. Since then, the CDC has reaffirmed the number in an online fact sheet (where it cited the broad range of estimates) and in a May report in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report - the latter was based on parents\' self-reporting of their doctors\' diagnoses. Meanwhile, an even more recent U.K. study published over the summer in the Lancet found a rate of children with autism of between one in 110 and one in 70. <BR><BR>The CDC has increased research spending on autism by 80% since 2002, to $15.1 million this year. (Autism groups say the government is still spending too little on research and support for parents and adults with autism.) <BR><BR>A nonprofit autism-advocacy group called Autism Speaks put the one-in-166 stat front and center in a media campaign distributed by the nonprofit Ad Council. The organization has grown quickly since launching last year, and is distributing $15 million in research funds this year, spokeswoman Susan Arons told me. \"We\'re using what is a very well-known, well-accepted number,\" she said. \"We don\'t want to be alarmists; we want to be accurate.\" <BR><BR>The nonprofit Autism Society of America, one of the oldest and largest autism groups, has seen its budget grow steadily in recent years, to about $20 million this year, President Lee Grossman told me. He attributed the increased donations to greater public awareness. <BR><BR>\"The one in 166 has been the biggest boon to awareness we\'ve had,\" said Marguerite Colston, director of communications for the Autism Society. \"Those kinds of numbers stop people in their tracks, as they should.\" <BR><BR>More Numbers <BR><BR>Equally galvanizing but more questionable are claims by some advocates, including the Autism Society, that autism prevalence has grown rapidly. An Autism Society Web page said autism is \"the fastest-growing developmental disability,\" and said the number of people with autism increased 172% in the 1990s while population rose 13%. <BR><BR>Trend figures for autism are difficult to pin down. Most of the scientific studies looking at the size of the autistic population have been completed relatively recently, and don\'t have historical comparisons, a point made in a 2001 paper by Dr. Fombonne questioning the existence of an autism epidemic. <BR><BR>Some groups (including the Autism Society) publish trend figures based on data collected from the Department of Education, which compiles counts of students with various disabilities as part of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. But changes in the way data are classified and handled have made that database an unreliable source for determining trends. <BR><BR>Until 1993, autism was lumped into other categories, such as mental retardation or emotional disturbance. Even after schools were asked to report autism separately, they labored initially under a narrower definition that preceded the DSM-IV. It took schools years to report more fully and catch more cases, Alexa Posny, director of special education programs at the Department of Education, told me. That made comparisons with figures before 2000 difficult. \"We\'re better at diagnosing and catching the students much earlier\" now, Ms. Posny said. <BR><BR>There has been a doubling since 2000 in the number of students aged six to 21 that schools identified as having autism, to 166,000 in 2004 from 80,000 in 2000. (Again, these figures use a broad definition of autism.) Several experts I spoke with told me they believed the increase has more to do with better record keeping and diagnosis than an increase in the number of autistic children. <BR><BR>Steven Goodman, associate professor of oncology, pediatrics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Schools of Medicine and Public Health, told me in an email, \"There have been a number of excellent papers that concluded that the definitions of autism are wholly to blame for the alleged increase in incidence; others have concluded they are partly to blame, and that some component of the increase is real. What is almost certainly not true is that this rate represents a 10- or 20- or whatever-fold increase in autism rates since the 1980s, which many quite vocal activist folks have claimed and vigorously promoted.\" <BR><BR>Ms. Colston agreed that some of the growth the Autism Society cites can be attributed to improved diagnostics and reporting. \"Diagnostics have improved so much,\" she said. But she added that other evidence, including reports from her group\'s members and from overtaxed state agencies, suggests a very real increase in incidence. \"That\'s what we believe, and what we see,\" Ms. Colston said. <BR><BR>The national media has also, at times, promoted the concept of an autism epidemic. Responding to some of these claims, Morton Ann Gernsbacher, professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin, co-authored a paper last year in Current Directions in Psychological Science titled, \"Three Reasons Not to Believe in an Autism Epidemic.\" One of her reasons stemmed from a close examination of data from California used to show a 273% increase from 1987 to 1998. Prof. Gernsbacher showed how broader diagnostic criteria \"will result in a dramatic increase in diagnosed cases.\" For example, among a sample of students diagnosed with autism before the broader DSM-IV definition was published in 1994, 61% were identified as having intellectual impairments. But only 27% of a more recent group of children categorized as autistic had such impairments. <BR><BR>As for the Department of Education data, the paper pointed out that other reporting categories showed huge growth immediately after they were introduced, as schools got on firm footing with new definitions. The number of students reported as having traumatic brain injuries soared more than 50-fold in the decade after it was introduced as its own category in 1991. Counts for children with \"developmental delay,\" meanwhile, rose more than seven-fold in the three years after that category was introduced in 1997. <BR><BR>Counting Everyone <BR><BR>The Autism Society also states that one to 1.5 million Americans have autism, a number derived by applying the CDC range of prevalence among children to an estimate of the general U.S. population of 300 million (and then applying some major rounding). Other advocacy groups cite a prevalence of 1.7 million, which based on the most recent decennial census\'s estimate of 280 million Americans. <BR><BR>But the available studies are all based on children. \"We really do not have a sense of how many adults would have been diagnosed with current-day criteria when those adults were children,\" the University of Wisconsin\'s Prof. Gernsbacher said. <BR><BR>Ms. Colston said of the Autism Society\'s estimate for total U.S. population: \"It\'s not a hard, fast, scientific number.\" She added that generally, there is a need for more study - and funding - for adult autism. \"It\'s the area of awareness that really needs to take off, and that includes statistics, as there aren\'t enough statistics on it,\" she said. <BR><BR>The bottom line: Stripped of spin and taken in context, the one-in-166 estimate does appear to be sound, if overly simplified. <BR><BR>Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp, a medical epidemiologist with the CDC in Atlanta, said autism studies can be particularly complex - hence the CDC\'s reported range. But she understands the desire to reduce the research into a convenient number. \"The general public, they want one number. All this information, across studies, areas, populations, they want to distill into one number,\" she said. \"My response is: It depends upon the methods used. There\'s not just one number out there.\" <BR><BR></P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Barney, 5, Autism dx  Fred, 7, NT</div>'

'<P>We are in NY. Our EI service coordinator volunteered to fill out a medicaid waiver for us. She said it was good to have in the event that at some point we needed to supplement therapies or equipment or if our financial situation ever changed. We said fine. We filled it out with her and had to send a copy of Aidan\'s Vineland scores. Our income was <strong>not</strong> a factor. If income was a factor we would have never been eligible. It was approved and we have the waiver. The only problem we faced was that Aidan\'s scores were a little high in their opinion for the waiver. If Aidan\'s scores on the Vineland go up at all they will revoke the waiver. </P> <P>Just wanted to recap, this was a pianless process for us that involved little to no effort. Our only problem was the fact that they basically use the Vineland on its own to determine that your child has a developmental disability - not the diagnosis. But we did receive it, at least for now, it was timely and required nothing more than filling out a form with our coordinator. Income played no role in the approval process. We are fortunate in that for now we actually don\'t need it as we our receiving all the services we need, but it is nice to know it\'s there incase we do.</P>'

'<P>Hello;</P> <P>I am new to he forum. My son is 9, and he has mild autism symptoms (was diagnosed with autism at 5, then there were questions about the diagnosis). He is very sweet and affectionate, but we do have an issue with behavior, wanting to do everything his way, defiance, oppisitional behavior. It gets very exhasting at times, and it seems that conventional methods of discipline don\'t work... He goes to a special ed class, plus Home School elective classes and music lessons, so I spend a lot of time trying to create the best learning environment for him.</P> <P>I have been in the relationship with a wonderful man, who has tried so hard to establish good peaceful grounds with my son. We\'ve been together for 2 years, and he has expressed concerns about not being able to deal with my son. Last week he left a letter for me saying that he loves me and he has tried to make it work, but he can\'t live with my son. Now I am really feeling like I am against the wall. My son is asking where he is. How do I explain? And how can someone leave when he says he still loves you? If that\'s really true, would he be able to walk away? He said in the letter that he sees a lifelong battle in front of him, and he is not ready for it. I knew it was hard for him, but I didn\'t expect he would leave like that, once and for all.</P> <P>I am starting to think that it\'s best to not get involved in the relationships in the future for the sake of my son\'s and my sanity.</P> <P>Any support or advice would be greatly appreciated.</P>'

'2 months is way too early to correctly identify any developmental delays. My <br />advice is do not worry. Continue to track his early development (like all <br />parents should) and keep a \"baby book\" noting both accomplishments and <br />idiosyncratic behavior.

He is impulsive and has trouble being <br />attentive at times. <br /> <br />Lately he has been having more erratic behavior, getting upset at <br />nothing, losing control and having what I think is some self-regulation <br />issues. He still has night terrors, but not as extreme (only when overly <br />tired). He wakes up early most days )4-5 am) and I have to get him back <br />to sleep. He hates to poop and gets so backed up we usually end up <br />giving an enema (he knows the texture of Miralax and throws up Milk of <br />Mag). He is still rigid with routines. I have even noticed him staring at the <br />lights for long times and spinning the wheels of cars on occasion. He will <br />repeat over and over again ( possible echolalia?). He doesn\'t like to refer <br />to folks in 3rd person-always 1st (he doesn\'t use pronouns very often), <br />He has had some aggression lately (hitting, etc.) which he has never done <br />til a month ago. <br /> <br />Cognitively he scored in the average range. His current OT and doc are <br />sending him for a seizure study to rule this out (the OT was surprised to <br />learn he hasn\'t been diagnosed with ASD....interesting). <br /> <br />With all the \"behavior\" stuff going on, is it still possible to be on the <br />spectrum but have some \"normal\" behaviors without having typical red <br />flags? He is very sociable and loves people. He smiles wonderfully and <br />shows empathy. Are we missing something here? Could it be OCD or <br />something else? I am at a loss. His outbursts and tantrums don\'t seem <br />typical of a preschooler. I think the therapists and docs aren\'t seeing the <br />whole picture. Any ideas? Again, sorry so long, but I am going nuts!!!'
'i did the test on childbrain and she scored 139 which it said was moderate pdd. what does that mean in terms of autism? i am confused by all the terms. i finally got a doctor that seems to want to help and he has referred her to a specialist i will keepyou all posted thanks for all the support<div class=\'post_sig\'>- fighting for a diagnosis</div>'
'<P>We just came back from a cross-continent trip. I had been worried about ds dealing with the different food and language and schedule and time change but he did amazingly well. Sometimes I underestimate him. We had a few little meltdowns but not bad at all, especially considering that he (and everyone else) got the flu while there. </P> <P>The only tense moment was when we came back. I had tried to prepare him with social stories of what was going to happen and how long it would all take. He managed the 11 hours total on the plane pretty gracefully but once we had to line up for passport check and customs he totally lost it. I think the standing in line, being tired and fluorecent lights just pushed him over the edge. He was screaming and trying to run and screamed at the immigration officer that he was an idiot and wasting his time. I thought they were going to haul us into an interrogation room. I was trying to figure out how to explain Aspergers to them while trying to calm ds before he\'d start trying to run again. I\'m sure he would have hit or bit the officers if they would try to stop him physically which they were moving to do. Thankfully they let us pass through. Next time I think I will have him wear a medical bracelet and bring a doctor\'s note just in case because that could have gone very badly.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- micki, mom to three wonderful and wild kids.  ds 10 asperger & anxiety  twin dds 6 quirky but NT this far</div>'
'I would check which airline you are flying and see if they will let you hold your autistic son. We had a diaster last time we flew on Southwest. They allowed me to hold Jason who was 3 1/2 at the time on the way to Utah (2 1/2 hr flight) but the plane on the way home broke down and so they had to put us on a flight with lots of people and they made him stay in a seat buckled in almost the entire 2 1/2 hrs back which meant major trauma for him and alot of unhappy people. (We also traveled with a new baby) Other than that I would not suggest the car unless he is good at traveling in his seat and napping. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Courage is being scared to death - and saddling up anyway! -John Wayne    Mom to two beautiful boys with ASD ages six and nine</div>'

'Hi..I just wanted to say thanks for starting such a thought-provoking thread Nikki. I think you mentioned some important points for us all to think about, whether we agree or disagree. In a perfect world, the autistic child would not stand out, would not be teased, would not have to WORK at just learning to play. For the past month, we\'ve been waiting on orders to move back to the states, and I might be a bad mom for it, but I really slacked on the therapy for Jakob...For this little bit of time, I just want him to be the happy baby that he is, I know as soon as we hit stateside, it\'s going to be therapy, therapy , therapy for probably the rest of his life. I kinda feel like I\'ve been in the eye of the storm for the past month. I think your take on things would be wonderful if society would allow it...I just don\'t think it\'s ever gonna happen. It\'s not human nature to accept things out of the ordinary. Not yet anyway. By the way, I think it was extremely obvious you weren\'t trying to be offensive by ANYTHING you\'ve written. Thanks again for the thoughts.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Stephanie  -  Mommy to Joey 11 y/o NT, and Jakob 6 y/o nonverbal/ autism</div>'
'Well I just had my first autism group meeting for parents. I am so overwhelmed, but I knew if I told you guys about it you would understand. Right now I am happy, depressed, worried, and tired at the same time. I meet other parents who were having more issues with their children than I am and I have two with autism. One parent just found out two days ago. She was crying and shaking. When I came home I just looked at my four year old that is high functioning and put my head on his chest. The tears just came out. Some how he must have understood how I felt because he put his arm around my head and gave me a kiss more than once. He even looked me straight in the eye. I would like to start my boys on the gluten and cassein free diet. I am so nervous. But I will give it a try. I know that it would be difficult at times because they already have their preferred foods. If any of you have a support group in your area I encourage you to go or start one up if you can. Many blessings to any parent that has a child with any disability.

'Mercedesmom - I think you can delay the MMR shot. My 20 mo. old has NOT had his, mainly because I knew he was asd before he was diagnosed (as most parents). Anyway, I am going to delay it as long as I can and then I am going to demand that they be done separately and months apart. As I posted before, my concern is that my son is progressing right now. He is starting to say words, he is following simple commands, he is playing with kids, etc. I am terrified to get the shot for him and see regression. I would delay it as long as I could - for your own peace of mind. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to Shea - Dec. 2004 (PDD-NOS) and  Jared May 1993 - Great big brother</div>'
'<P>I too feel a sense of urgency to intervene in these early years for both of my boys. They best way to get your wif on board is to hear it from a professional, not you. We went to a pediatric psych who specializes in autism. She said you need to do as much ABA as you can and start now. My husband got to hear it from someone other than me that there is a problem and it is neccsart to address this pronto. With our Floortime, we do 20-30 hour a week of VB/ABA and it has brought my son from less than 20 word approximations at age 3 who never seem to connect to a kid who is so much fun, talks all day and is very much connected. We are just starting the process with my younger guy and he is considered mild at this point. My husband\'s initial reaction, was that he was not as bad as my older guy, thus not neeeding as much intervention. The psychologist impressed the importance of intervention and now we are getting things set up. It\'s much easier to hear from a professional than a spouse. Do you have a diagnosis from a professional such as a psychologist or developmental ped? </P> <P>I agree that the more you can interact and engage with your little guy the better. Sometimes, it\'s not which therapy or model, rather the intensity and quantity of how much he is engaged. we hire VB tutors to implement my older guy\'s program and they also do some Floortime. I work very hard 1:1 with my little guy throughout the day and we are soon going to start a program for him.</P> <P>I hope that was somewhat helpful.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom of 2 boys  4 year old ASD  2 year old ASD</div>'
'The not wanting to share thing is soo typical of that age with ANY kid.<br><br>Some parents give their child one special item that they do NOT have to share. Apparently when the child knows they don\'t have to share something that is especially dear to them they become more relaxed and often they won\'t mind sharing something else instead. ? Might be worth a try if the sharing thing continues to be a problem.<br><br>Biting is big with little kids because they can\'t communicate their frustrations easily , or at all, and they don\'t have much self control.<br>As they get older they should outgrow it, but with sensory issues, or if they still aren\'t talking much it can continue to be a temptation.<br><br>My 4 1/2 year old bit his 12 year old cousin recently when they were playing ball together. In that case he didn\'t do it out of anger but just because he was over stimulated and sooo excited he just bit him without thinking! I was SHOCKED! he hasn\'t done that in a long long time!
