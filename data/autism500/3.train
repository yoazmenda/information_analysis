' <div class=\"postbody\">It\' is going very bad with the K teacher since day 1, my child comes crying everyday because of the difference in the treatment. He is aware that teacher prefers certain kids to others. We are immigrants and the teacher is a little bit not very tolerant, she prefers blond blue eyes kids. He thinks its the norm because of the previous pre-k bad experience. I know that teachers will not go against each other for a child. Please note that the child is extremely bright academically and way above K level. I don\'t want my child to have a low self esteem and feel inferior. Last week a parent pulled their daughter from the class but went to another school (also immigrants).  What solutions do I have? He doesn\'t want to be homeschooled. He loves people.  Thank you for your help</div>'

I am not sure if my daughter has autism or not but either way, she does have a \"stim.\"      I always thought her finger wiggling was a habbit.  I never thought much of it, although I always found it to be odd looking.  I just assumed she would outgrow it.  She is four now.      My question is, will it ever go away?  I am new to the idea she may have autism and to be honest I am feeling a bit overwhelmed.  Before I realized what she was doing was not a habbit, I tried to get her to stop.  She was able to stop at that moment without any problems however just a few hours later, she would be doing it again.      Does anyone have advise on what I can do for her?  Do your children stim?  Do they drift off at a certain age?  Do I just need to let her do it?     I am so confused and sad I was pushing her to stop when she couldnt control herself.  Any advise would really help me out.</div>'

At home, he has to go to his room for time-out for about 4-5 minutes when he does something he knows he shouldn\'t (ex. sit on the cat).      A lot of times, I can ask him \"do you want to go to time-out?\" when I see him about to do something he shouldn\'t.  Most of the time he\'ll reply \"no\" and stop doing it.  Key word being MOST!!

However, they are seperate disorders. Many children (most? all? I\'m not really sure about this) with autism have SPD but not all people with SPD are autistic. SPD can often be seen alongside other developmental disorders and it can also exist on it\'s own with no other issues.  Dana has posted some fantastic sensory resources and links. Check in the reference section. Also, if this is an avenue you are exploring, I would highly recommend, <strong>The Out-of-Sync Child: Recognizing and Coping with Sensory Integration Dysfunction</strong>, by Carol Stock Kranowitz  I found it to be invaluable in helping me to recognize SPD in my son.

' <div class=\"postbody\">It\'s really nice to read that parents on the site have children who have had very positive Montessori experiences. I was in Montessori education full-time for years, and now work one-one with children with autism.     I have some thoughts to share that might help a lot of children, parents, and teachers.    While Montessori really lends itself to special needs and sensory issues, the teachers are like I was before I had exposure to the subject of autism and other conditions. It\'s great that a good teacher usually tunes into each child individually, and \"gets\" what a child is experiencing.     Montessori teachers ASSUME that no one child is going to be like another. Montessori teachers see it is their job to support the child by working well with parents, who are of course the first and will always be the most important teachers for any child. This is how they are trained. But they are usually not trained to work with children with special needs, per se, nor how to talk with parents about their observations when a child presents with behavior or learning differences. This is an aside...but Montessori is such a multi-sensory experience, that a child with auditory processing or other difficulties can often have his or her issues go unnoticed for longer because of the visual, non-verbal, and kinesthetic aspects of the whole experienced. (longer than would be the case in a traditional preschool.)    Parents who are involved with Montessori might consider making presentations at staff meetings as teachers are hungry for first-hand information from those they truly respect - the parents! Or, even if you\'re not involved with a school, most Montessori schools would welcome a parent with insights and first-hand experiences about ASD issues.    Right now there are a few children who have definite behavior and learning issues at the school I enjoy subbing at (between the 10 day AIT sessions that I hold). These children who could strongly benefit from OT and other interventions, though I am not surely not qualified to say how they would be assessed if evaluated. There are definitie sensory and communication challenges there also.    Neither parents nor teachers are usually informed about special needs issues and the potential that can come from early intervention. When teachers believe there are issues that need to be looked into, and understand the benefits of early diagnosis, they can be really \"up against it\" when they broach the subject with parents. Two out of three parents seem to remove a child from school rather than get an evaluation for a 2 or 3 year-old. Teachers and school admin may need some help from parents so staff can talk to parents in ways that can be heard.     Knowing now what I\'ve learned from parents, children, and other trainings, I\'d have both a way for parents to train teachers AND a parent support group within the school to offer help, support, and information to other parents.     If a child\'s doctor doesn\'t think there is an issue, which is so often the case, it\'s only natural that parents wait until they\'ve heard concerns from more than just 1 teacher or school. It can be such a hard bridge to cross to go from \"my child is doing fine\" to \"perhaps my child has special needs and requires some new opportunities\"...or \"my child has autism.\"    It would be so much more in the service of children if children could stay in this environment that serves them so well AND recieve the necessary interventions - and if parents could recieve more support around investigating these matters.    All this is not to say that sometimes Montessori doesn\'t offer the small groups and structure needed for kids on the spectrum. But many children can manage wonderfully once their sensory issues and other challenges are addressed adequately.    Jennifer</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Your son sounds much like mine.  A distressed birth.  The nerve not developing properly is also like mine--we have found out that it is likely due to a systemic mold infection. The thought is that antibiotics early in life wiped out the good flora in his gut, and a mold infection, we think from the home we lived in, got a good foothold.  He is deaf in one ear.    I would consider getting your doctor to prescribe nystatin, and take it for a month.  It is non-toxic and does not leave the bowel.  It will probably really help gut issues also; we take a probiotic between doses of nystatin daily.  My son is 12 and in managed recovery.  After doing all this for almost 10 years now, I look back and antifungals are the thing that helped him the most over the years, but we did not really understand this (or why!) at the time.  We would do a round (15 days) of nystatin or diflucan, he\'d do really great, and then we\'d begin the gradual backslide.  If antifungals work, you need to stay on them as you work to heal the gut.  Also if you get a really good response to antifungals, you might consider consulting a toxicologist or environmental medicine specialist instead of a DAN.  This is what I wish I\'d done; didn\'t know any better then, but I do now.  Good luck!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hey everyone,  I have been super duper busy and just when I got time to catch up on this forum...my computer was giving us trouble-ugh!!  I hope everyone is well and gosh, I feel like I have been away from my family although it has only been a short time!    My question is this....    My Audrey who is 2 1/2 yrs old is fascinated with books (and has been for about 2 months)...we only really give her picture books or simple sentence books, but she has been labeling everything since she started to talk a couple months ago.  Tonight when she was playing with her Baby Einstein and Baby Bumblebee flash cards, I decided to cover the picture separately and just have her \"read\" the words at the bottom.  She never knew which card I took because I took the whole pile and covered one , but she \"read\" - dog, cat, duck, elephant, banana, apple, flower, etc.  I then decided that maybe she had just memorized them because she really likes looking at the flash cards and the words.  I then got a new set of flash cards that she had never seen and tried them...she got several of the words that she would have seen before correct and she even said \"dog\" for frog and \"duck\" for truck.  Does this mean she is hyperlexic?? Could she just be memorizing the words with the pics or is that the same thing?    I have only heard about this but never imagined she was doing that - but did notice how intently she stares at her books and especially the words on them.  Does anyone know more about this?    Thanks for any info....and does this mean we should be doing different things in her aba or natural setting teaching---should we encourage this and help or not?      Thanks guys!!  Kim</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I live in Toronto, and my son attends The Toronto Montessori for Autism. Thank goodness for this school, it has enpowered my child and the approach is amazing. It incorporates the Montessori approach with ABA..the program is structured for my son. My son get 2:1 approach (can\'t afford 1:1)...this will be his second year in the program and this year he will be intergrated with NT children on Montessori field trips and outdoor play. My son attended public school for 7 months, 7 months I wasted on giving my son what he deserves. I fought daily with that school, they were a bunch of ignorant people that left my son in the corner, the only thing he learned was how to use the photocopier. 2 months in the Montessori school my son can name every country in Europe and South America..I can\'t do that, he learns piano as part of his class, daily chores and respondsibilities...I could go on and on. BTW the Director of the School is soooooooooooooo educated and passionate about the abilities and potential of our kids. Do a search on The Toronto Montessori School for Autism. You can even purchase her manual to use or give to your Montessori school to use as a guide for educating a child with autism in the Montessori way....Amazing, warning though this manual is extremely detailed.

' <div class=\"postbody\">For us the inability to show empathy was a big red flag - particularly in our daughter(dx PDD-NOS).  She is very verbal and very social - but whenever a situation came where she needed to respond in an empathetic manner - she always gave an inappropriate response.  She would laugh when she was in trouble (and at the time we thought she was just a \"spirited\" kid), she would laugh if someone was crying/hurt.  I distinctly remember her laughing hysterically when I had morning sickness during my pregnancy with my youngest child.  Now after a TON of social stories later she is starting to get it - sometimes she overreacts Mason (dx: ASD), just doesn\'t respond much at all to those situations.  Sometimes we may get an \"are you ok?\", or if I fake it heavily during play (like start fake crying) he will cry too but those instances are few and far between.

My sweet son has already been through so much in his short 2 1/2 years that it has been really hard for me to accept that this is now another huge hurdle for him.  With that said, my husband and I are ready to roll up our sleeves and get to work to help him the very best we can!  Here are just a few of the hundreds of questions I have swirling around my head:  1.Any tips on how to balance your time for research?  I have read this forum, online and so many books lately that it is making my head hurt--literally!  I need some advice on how to balance this with all of our other efforts.  I don\'t want to be obsessed with reading about everything at the expense of spending time with my children.  Recently I have been waiting until everyone is in bed, but I can\'t keep doing this because I am so exhausted from staying up so late trying to figure out all the biomed/diet stuff, therapy ideas, etc.  2.Any ideas that have worked for you on streamlining all the paperwork---tracking behaviors/concerns, etc.  I feel like I need to document his every move---behavior specialist wants data, I want to see how different foods affect him, dr. wants all the poop details, the list goes on and on!  I am need of some serious forms/charts, something!  3.I know this is a particularly hard one, but any advice would be appreciated.  How have you balanced things with your other children?  As you all know very well, most days it feels like this child with special needs is a full time job, if not him, all the coordination, paperwork, etc.  While it is my tendency to want to give him everything I\'ve got---I have other children that I love just as dearly.

He\'s really cool.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <img src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h44/sashasrecovery/AutismRibon.gif\" alt=\"Image\" /></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thanks guys, I\'m getting excited now! lol      Good points about the peak hours and younger kids, mmesmama and sashasmom.  Whichever gym we choose, the caregivers will have to give him more attention, especially at first, as if he\'s going to display any \"undesirable\" or aggressive behaviors, it\'s usually out of excitement when meeting <strong>new </strong>kids in a <strong>busy </strong>environment.  But if the caregivers are willing to work with us for the first couple of weeks, and we avoid peak hours, I think it could work.  Keeping my fingers crossed!</div>'

Once they get to the front of the line, let them get a prize (maybe a \'swim\' in the sink or a tub of water, or a \"treat\") Move it to a piece of tape on the floor, eventually, and have him practice lining up stuffed animals or something similar, and have him get in line, once each one of his \'friends\' gets through, allow him a treat. I think that would help with understanding getting through a line/waiting... You could have his \'friends\' get out of line, and not allow them back in, and deny them treats...this might help with understanding getting out of the line...

' <div class=\"postbody\">i can only speak for my son\'s martial arts class, but the whole basis of the class in respect for self, self discipline, and above all else respect for others.  Bullying is dealt with swiftly and harshly, they have a zero tolerance.  One kid lost his belt for bullying, another was not allowed to test the because of fighting at school, it\'s uncommon, but I\'ve seen kids running laps for being rude to an instructor or a class mate.  The reason it is uncommon is because it doesn\'t happen very often.  I would most definitely bring it to the attention of an instructor.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I agree with getting yourself healthy before you get pregnant and eat fresh organic food while pregnant and lots of green veggies.  Take probiotics too.    My son was vaccinated fully and received thimerisol in his shots.  He had such bad reactions after each round of shots that I was told were \"normal.\"  I would never give him another shot in his life.  He simply cannot handle it.  I do give him a wholesome diet with lots of green veggies and other supplements to keep him immune system healthy in case he does get sick.  My son was the healthiest kid in his class this year according to his teacher.  He rarely got sick, and if he did, it was very mild and he was over it in a few days.    With my daughter, I spaced out her shots for the first 12 months and she did not have any reaction to them until the chicken pox vaccine.  She started to get a little spacy for a few days and I stopped the shots altogether.  Both my kids had problems with the live virus vaccinations.  My daughter has an awesome diet and eats lots of veggies and drinks a green drink everyday.      If you do choose to vaccinate, space them out, don\'t vaccinate within a month of an illness, and don\'t give more than 1 or 2 at a time.  Monitor all reactions and see how your child reacts to them.  I wish this information had been available to me 7 years ago.  The information out there now is incredible and you can really make an informed choice.    Hope that helps.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Yes!  We\'ve seen this a lot.  My three year old has a few different patches that will turn very blond when he is regressing and darken when he\'s moving forward.  His hair also gets very oily when he\'s moving forward and very dry when he\'s regressing.  This also goes along with his skin getting dry or normal.  I just assumed it was him--interesting that others are seeing this.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Ok. Before anyone says stop worrying and enjoy your son, I couldn\'t  possibly have more fun with him than I do.  He is the highlight of everyday and I can\'t wait to get home from work to see him.  We have so much fun together, and I do mean together.  He\'s a social kid.    Unfortunately, there are still so many questions.  It\'s still so frustrating that every professional he has contact with: Developmental Pediatrician, 4 Pediatricians, 2 Speech Therapists, Early Intervention, Occupational Therapist all say there\' s nothing wrong besides a delay.  Of course this won\'t be frustrating if they turn out to be correct.    My boy is 18 months old and has made great strides in his motor development.  He was 5 weeks early and was behind in gross motor, but is catching up quick in that area.  He seems to understand a lot of what we say.  If I ask him to go get me the phone or his shoes, he\'ll run in the other room and come back with them.  He will answer questions by shaking his head no and he\'s started saying \"yes\".  He also will pretend to talk on the phone and sometimes will try and feed his bear.  He\'s a pointing machine and he will sometimes point to things of interest and see if we are looking.  These are good things right?     So what am I concerned with?    His expressive language, eye contact, lack of empathy,  He has maybe 6 words and I\'m not even sure they are words.  He doesn\'t seem to initiate any words.  He will answer what does a cow say, or do you want this, but doesn\'t just try to say things to us.  Maybe just labeliing once in awhile.  Is this ok?  He still won\'t look anyone in the eye when they are holding him.  He does have good eye contact when it\'s from a little further away.  He has no attachement to objects or toys.  Isn\'t he supposed to at this point.  He has no toy preferences.  He will play with cars appropriately though.  He\'s not interested in wheels or anything.  Should he have empathy at this point?    What other behaviors should I be looking for at this age?  I\'ve read all of the first signs, red flags, blah, blah, but from your personal experience- what really matters at this age?    What would be YOUR red flags at 18 months?    Thanks in advance.    John</div>'

She mentioned that there is a DTaP combo that is mercury free now.     She also mentioned to follow the vaccine schedule in her book \"What you doctor may not tell you about children\'s vaccinations\". She recommends to seperate the MMR vaccine into 3 shots giving the measels first, then the rubella, then the mumps.     She commented that if she had a child with Autism (vaccine related or not) that she would NOT vaccinate a sibling to the ASD child.

' <div class=\"postbody\">At 2.5 my son had a few words that he wasn\'t using consistently. At that time he had been diagnosed with \"speech delay, no autistic features\" (yeah, right) and was getting some ST through EI. Not helpful at all.  Regressed massively at 2.7, lost all words and many other skills (we were afraid he had CDD so ironically the diagnosis of ASD was a tiny relief), diagnosed as autistic (\"pretty severe\" according to neurologist). Started ABA/VB around 2.8 and it helped him learn to talk again. Aquiring new words doesn\'t seem to be a problem for my son because he has great memory, using language in conversational/social context is. We were also having a whopping 1 hour /week ST through EI which was absolutely useless and I ended up cancelling many sessions because they were such a waste of time. To this date my son never had a good SLP working with him. It was his VB therapist who also addressed articulation issues, apraxia etc. I will be looking again into speech this year because of prosody issues.  Alex\'s mom  P.S. I also credit removing milk from his diet very early on for a chunk of his improvement, because we saw notable changes right away before our program really got going.

Not that ABA is wrong - but why should cost be mentioned when ABA obviously costs more?

Did you seek an autistic child, or did one fall in your lap.  I would love to hear more about how you came to have him.  --Kristal</div>    In the process of adopting.  D is our foster son, who\'s been with us just about two years now.  He basically \"fell into our laps\" lol, we were approached and asked if we would foster him, based on our backgrounds in working with children/people with special needs.  Hubby worked specifically with autistic children for 7 years, and was known around town as \"the autism guy\"  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /> After D started to thrive in our home, he was put up for adoption, and after some long heartfelt talks, hubby and I decided to adopt him - we just couldn\'t allow for him to be moved again.  This kid has been let down by everyone in his life, and we refuse to let him down.    Geez I love my kid.    The hard parts though are a)not knowing his background very well, such as when he first had symptoms, what he was exposed to, what interventions were done, what he was like as a wee one, etc., and b)knowing that if he\'d been with us, and had good intervention earlier, he\'d be a lot better off.  We didn\'t get him until he was 6 1/2 - that\'s over SIX YEARS of lost time.  I truly believe that if D had been put in a good, supportive, SAFE home from infancy that he\'d be \"normal\" today.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Ok, I am not a doctor. My brother Jim is. But I work with him in developing the computer programs behind his protocol.     In our practice, we find that 20% of our patients need TMG and the rest it has a damping effect (lessens the effect of MB12). There are posts on this board in which Tami removed TMG and the things that happend were amazing.    Would you be willing for a 2 week trial to remove TMG and see if you get a more positive effect? You can always addit back if response drops off.    Have you notice pink, red or orange urine? If so, make the injection even shallower.    Lastly the parent designed report form on our website, <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.drneubrander.com\">www.drneubrander.com</a><!-- w -->, is designed to find the little things that show response to MB12. We have many patientes who do not get a big response in language so without the form they think nothing is happening until they fill out the parent designed report form and see all the little stuff happening. That is how you know MB12 is needed. Also, we find that when needed and even if not a lot of the Language part, that geat strides happen as more and more of the brain recovers.    Now, 6% of our patients do not respond to MB12. The parent designed report form has hardly any responses. These are the ones that truly do not need to be on the shots.</div>'

It seems some professionals view kids with autism just like any other object or possession that clutters their life. They are laughing at the things that make them autistic, not at what makes them beautiful and alive. I think what MCA describes is the latter and is a child\'s amazing ability to remind you just what is important in life. It\'s almost a feeling you get, and that feeling makes you laugh. As opposed to laughing first, if that makes any sense.    I think there is a culture amongst professionals as to \"these are the things we laugh at\" about kids with autism. To me, it\'s sad that they can\'t build a sincere relationship and find a unique reason to enjoy the children they are <em>lucky</em> to be around.

Just thought i mentioned it just in case you did not see it.     On the part that he had been restrained, since it was not documented there isen\'t much you can do about it.  They will just say it never happened and that will be the end  of that subject for them. Unless you can prove otherwise or have evidence,  there isen\'t much you will be able to do about that argument.  sorry.     On  the subject of being mistreated  it is sad to say but some, and I will say to this subject that their are many good and wonderful teachers that   do care about our children but yes there are very bad apples in the bunch. Evans was very mistreated when he was in florida  in the second grade  by a terribble &amp; dreadful teacher that had been working for the school system and  with special need children  for a very long  time. She was fired later that same year. She was caught  by  a  mother pulling her nonverbal &amp; autistic  child by the hair and dragging him on the classroom  floor.  She  said the child  would not  comply.   We have  to monitor our children  when  you as a parent  dont have a good filling about your childs teacher &amp; his school.      That was why i became a advocate. I started like you are doing now    fighting for evans rights, and taking the whole distic on until our names were recognized all over our county. That was not our intentions,  but by the time we were done everyone in the school system,  in our area knew who we were. I thought that was just sad that we had  to  resort to those measures to get our child what he needed by the school system, but that is how it is many times with our children.  It\'s just  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" />  I never trusted anyone again in the school system.    THEY LIE ALL THE TIME.  We are still fighting in Mass  to get him what he needs. It never seems to stops  when you have a child with a dissability.  We will never stop  fighting for him until he is 22  &amp; out of the school system.  They are  stuck with us until then. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />    You know what his rights are on Goals. You  know your proof of his intelligence is written on your docummented records provided by his independent evaluations. You have no need  to argue that  point  with them. just show them his scores on his  test, that should prove your case on that subject.     We have so many storys is not  funny.  They told  you \"We  really don\'t know what he understands \"  when i  was doing my fighting in  the school system  One day we had  our team meeting . One of the teacher  told  me  evans was  so retarded that  he could  not even tell  or recognize who he was  with his own picture. could  not recognize anyone.   Did not  know  how wave good buy. or give a Hug. That  was the  biggest lie ever. We were  so disgusted  with the system.   They  told us the best  thing for him and us was to  place him in a recidential  school because their  was no way for this child to learn.   THAT WAS IT .    We had to moved  him  from  schools, to other schools  because they  were just  giving us a hard time  until we just got tired, we  hired a  lawyer &amp;  made them pay  for all of his education.  Today they are paying $26000 for his school.   PAY Back Time.  He has a ABA program, Music,  His teachers are all  trained  in autism.

My personal opinion is that Walmart should be boycotted. I know plenty of people are poor and are glad of their cheap prices, but inevitably somebody pays for those cheap prices. The consumer does, because they dont get quality and the supplier does, because they dont pay for much for their products. They keep wages low by continuing to buy from sweat shops in the phillipines and elsewhere, and generally, their attitude makes me ill.     At some point we as consumers have to realise that we cant everything for next to nothing. Walmart, like Mcdonalds has no interest whatsoever in our health or well being.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Melanie, are you sure he <em>can </em>drink from a cup?  Is it truly stubbornness/rigidity or could he have some problems coordinating his mouth movements?    If it\'s truly stubbornness and nothing else then I\'d treat it like any other behavior and teach it via an ABA style drill, with a really desirable reinforcer for every time he drinks from the cup.  Start with tolerating having the cup in front of him, then move to lifting the cup to his mouth, then maybe sticking between his lips, and finally taking a small sip.  After a while he\'ll get more used to it and probably not fight it so much when it\'s offered outside the drill.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I would think that you should just do your show the same way you always do with one exception don\'t be as loud, I found that if you talk quieter you will be better able to get their attention because then you aren\'t assaulting their senses and in your effects because really loud noises can hurt, they tend to have really sensitive hearing.  For this kind of show there isn\'t much else in the way of modification you can do for them.  I think the whole point to having a seperate show for autistic adults is that if one of them has an issue it won\'t be disturbing a typical audience or embarrassing the autistic person having the problem, everyone knows what\'s going on and won\'t be judgmental.    They also tend to be very visual so you might want to gear your act in that direction.    I think it is great that you are willing to this.  I think that the person you were talking to referred to them as kids because in many ways they still are.

I have often heard it said that unfortunately, when you write letters like that, you are not writing it so much to the person to whom it is addressed, you are writing it for the higher-up person down the road who is going to have to make a decision about your child quite possibly without you there.  In the US, the parents are not invited to the due process hearings (I believe).  Your written words have to stand for themselves if your situation gets to that point.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Lisa, you hit on an interesting point, what in god\'s name is a \"global development delay\"???? What does it mean exactly. To me it means absolutely nothing and i have heard this term being used in my doctors office (full of doctors who didnt even have a clue my son was autistic 6 months after his diagnosis). It sounds like you are just going to have to barge ahead and do what you need to do and not put too much weight on what these people are saying, particularly these teachers.     A child is dx\'d every 12 minutes in teh US with autism. Its not like children with autism arent \"out there\" for all to see. You must be very very frustrated, i know you are. Dont let the buggers get you down and pay attention only to those you trust, i.e. someone with dx experience based on a history of experience and your own personal mommy instinct.     I have to say that despite everyone and i mean EVERYONE saying my son was just great from age 12 months to to the day of his diagnosis just before he was 2.5years, i KNEW deep inside that it was autism.     I am in no way saying that your child is \"autistic\" and there are so many variables for a child so young. But pressing forward and getting the very best help you can get and ignoring the \"do gooders\" and know it alls, like teachers, might save you a lot of headaches and pain.     From what you have said so far, your child has some similarities to my child, but not all. If you are looking for comparisons here, I could not from the bottom of my heart say that your child does or does not appear to be like my child. I would tell you if he seemed like mine.     For those who cant diagnose properly or for those who WONT diagnose, the term autism and GDD are interchangeable really. They know not of what they speak. I am putting myself in your shoes right now, and I am hurting, cause it is all coming back to me. its like they make it more difficult for us on purpose. Its all so tied up with money and resources and often, lack of diagnostic ability.     My sons first paediatrician told me what i think she wanted me to hear.She echoed what the SLT said, that what she saw in my son was \"not uncommon\". The 2nd paed dx\'d him in minutes, i think as soon as he walked in the door. She just knew. She had the experience.     The worst your son is going to get is a dx when he dosent need one. but if he DOES need one, YOU need one, to get him services.     really feel for you hun.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I am constantly being told by relatives that the reason my son doesn\'t talk is because we cater to him all the time - why talk when we\'re always serving his needs? Yes, my son is so stubborn and so spoiled, he is <em>willfully </em>deciding not to talk!     My favorite is my aunt\'s comment:  \"I bet if he stayed with <em>me </em>for a week, he\'d be talking!\"</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I guess when I think of social, I think of reciprocal engagement.  My son is \"social\", but to use Alex\'s mom\'s term, it is for his own agenda.  He will seek out peers, but for his own pleasure (ie; chase <em>me</em> or tickle <em>me</em>).  He enjoys being around kids, will approach adults and kids to initiate play, but I think it has more to do with what that person can offer <em>him </em>than it is a genuine desire to interact or connect with another person.  But maybe I\'m overpathologizing here.    A social difference between #1 and #2 is that #2 will walk over and offer me a piece of his cookie.  Seeing me smile at being offered some cookie he will continue to offer me pieces of his cookie.  With #1 I will have to <em>ask </em>him for a piece and he will make a point to give me barely a crumb, and even if I smile and make a big deal about his generosity, he will make sure he\'s well away from me should I dare ask him to give up any more of his cookie.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I just reviewed a book called <em>Independence Bound</em> in the book review section.  While there are aspects of the book I dislike, it shows how a mother helped her son, who has little to no speech as I recall, and is not regarded as \"high functioning,\" get a place of his own, a job, and the assistance he needs to successfully live without her, without his \"siblings taking care of him\" or anything like that.  That might be useful for anyone worrying that speech is going to be the particular barrier to that stuff.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I also have problems with restaining a child if its not to do with the safety of your child or another. In my sons preschool when they have mat time if my son is reluctant a teacher will put R on their knee but if he insists on not being there they would let him go. I think forcing compliance like that would be counter productive as well as being dangerous, I\'m sure it wouldn\'t teach your son self control.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">This may be more of a sign of a speech issue rather than the autism or both, but when listening to Tamara Kasper at a wrksp, (she is a speech path who learned VB from Carbone) she says that a lot of the autistic kids tend to have mobius mouth, which my son did. She describes it as having a very thin, barely there upper lip, and the upper lip looks like a hood if you look from a side view. This makes it difficult for the kids to make some of the lip formations needed for speech, and using a straw takes practice because the upper lip has to come down more. I hope that made some sense, as she described it better!!  Rose</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I would definitely say something, but do it very gently. When my twin boys were about to turn 2 and still not talking, another Mom at a play group mentioned the words &quot;speech delay&quot; to me, and that\'s what gave me the jump start to address my boys\' problems. I think before that time I was in denial.   If you could say something like, &quot;I knew someone/saw on a message board that someone/heard of someone that had a child who wasn\'t talking when they were 2, he had a speech delay. His parents asked the pediatrician about it, they did some things to check it out, like a hearing test. After that they started doing some things to help him start talking.&quot;  I would not say the word autism, but &quot;speech delay&quot; is much less threatening, and it is something she can google so she can get some information about what to do next. So if your friend asks you questions, you can say &quot;I don\'t really know much about it, just what I heard/saw,  why don\'t you google speech delay.&quot;</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">OHH, what a great post and timely for me, cause this is just what i have been thinking.     15 months ago when we started discrete trials in our lovaas program my boy could not physically put a \"bead on\" a string. He just was physically unable to do it.     That was when he was 2 and 10 months. Now he is 4 and i left that same box of beads out for him to play with. Magically he put 15 beads on the string without prompting and with no problem, pulling them through himself. he actually enjoyed it.     When i think of how awful i felt cause my little boy could not put a bead on a string at the age of almost 3!!! Now, over a year later, i truly believe that it was his own maturation that has helped him. He is stronger, cognitively he understands the connection between the bead and the string, etc etc.    WE have not used ABA intensively at all. We sometimes think what kind of little boy we would have had we used the 30hrs plus approach but our boy has made so many gains with only limited hours (sometimes only 4 a week.     To be honest, i have always had my doubts about ABA for our boy. Not to say it isnt enormously helpful in teaching and curbing \"behaviours\" but in terms of the learning curve our boy has developed, a lot of it has to do with just him, not anything external.     Speech magically appeared last august with our little guy. He blurted out \"daddy\" one day, and it has just come on since then. Its like the old \"light switch\" scenario. Where then he had about 10 babble words, now he can say any word we ask him and he is requesting as well. ABA didnt do this, though we helped elicit speech by making him request things before he got them and certainly we helped his play skills by playing with him and showing how things work.     Its a hard call for a parent, here. I am way past beating myself up and now i am quite sure that our boy at 4, who has matured so much since age 2.6 is just a more \"mature\" child, and in the process of maturing has just naturally learned things.     We all know our kids are bright, so its not hard to accept that they learn more and more as they go along, just like any other child. Exposure to life, brings knowledge.     really like this post and it could go on for months! so much to think about.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Honestly, MCA.  <em>You </em>know how to teach.  <em>You</em> know your son.  Hence, you know how to teach your son.  I can see where you might need an extra pair of hands.  But maybe you ought to consider dropping the ABA team and hiring a young college kid- probably an aspiring teacher would be best, not even necessarily special ed.  I did a lot of babysitting and tutoring during college.  I worked with speech delayed students and what turned out to be an Asperger\'s child.  I even managed to get him to eat new foods though he had extreme aversions, which at the time I remember being so frustrated as I had never encountered such a \"picky\" eater in my life.  Anyway, the only thing I think that you are lacking is confidence.  These people who are with your son now are nobody special- but <em>you </em>are.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">My daughter showed no signs until 18 months (shortly after mmr vaccine *shrug) old. Before that she was bright, active, had a few quirks, could speak beyond her age, never crawled, ate anything I gave her, would even sing nursery rhymes with me. At 18 months she just disappeared, speech, social interaction, everything was gone. She\'d stared into space for hours or screamed endlessly. Only two things from before 18 months carried over past 18 months: never sleeping through the night (until age 3yrs old) and runny stools.      Son was slow to do nearly everything after he turned two years old. It was like he was hopping along normally then decided to shift to major slow mode in learning. Yeah, he had his vaccines at 24 months, not sooner (we feared he might turn out like daughter if he had it on schedule). Not saying that is what caused it but we didn\'t want chances. Only \"autistic\" like thing I noticed back before age 2 was delayed speech. After year two he seemed to lose a lot of skills, especially fine and large motor and his speech stopped developing \"normally\" but progressed (don\'t laugh) full steam into a secret language, complete in with tones and all. His social skills never developed past a 3 year old lvl (he\'s 7 now), nor many other mental/behavioral skills. Speech is improving this year.</div>'

This line that the doctors and charities, etc feed you that your child wont recover that autism is FOREVER is clearly not truth - no not all kids will recover but i personally believe that ALL kids improve.  For me, good parenting is key. No matter what your child looks like acts like, treat them like your other children and dont pander to their \'autism\'. (Insert here a vitriol from the neurodiverse crowd)  My own child who i felt was almost completely unmanageable until the age of 5 has changed dramatically since I gave him some breathing space (no more ABA, no more behavioural therapies) I have given him much more credit and much more room to succeed or fail - i reduced my fear about him and just let him get on with things but with the full belief that he CAN do things and CAN learn.   I think so much of autism is down to us.   &quot;Oh, Johnny can\'t do that - he has never done that and remember HE HAS AUTISM &quot;Oh, thats ok for your child but MY CHILD HAS AUTISM&quot; &quot;Oh, autism is forever, no one ever RECOVERS&quot;  Many working with autism have a vested interest in keeping our kids autistic - just look at the charities and other voluntary organisations who wont ever tell you about biomed, or about \'doing it yourself\' or who do very little to help you as a parent.   Look at the number of individuals and groups who claim to be able to \'cure\' your child - autism has a huge market potential and as long as our kids remain \'autistic\' well, why would they want to recover  your child. ??  I personally know children, including my own who were written off by the doctors and teachers - all they saw was the label and how the kid looked at a particular time. So they made decisions for some of these kids like saying they had very little cognitive ability, would never read or write, etc and whammo, the kid is locked into a room for the \'special ones\'.  Having had a child who many would have regarded as \'severely\' autistic I am not speaking for the aspie end, i am speaking for the parents whose kids still arent toilet trained at 5 or 6 or even 7, the kids who still smear their excrement, the kids who dont have any language yet.   One day, my own son put a few things together in his OWN head and started doing things - he needed the time WITHOUT pressure to understand how it all fit in - but MOSTLY he needed to trust that I or others weren\'t going to judge him if he failed, and who would give him a 2nd, 3rd and 50th chance to try without having a hissy fit. (which his teachers unfortunately did)  We enter dangerous territory as parents when we talk about recovery of our kids. For me, i dont care what you call it but recovery for me means a child who can live happily and independently and who has a life OUTSIDE of autism.   When i meet parents who continue to tell me that their kids will never recover I do have to wonder why they are wedded to that idea/belief - what is it about THEM that keeps them thinking this?   I have met parents who are co-dependent, i have met parents who live vicariously through their own children\'s disability, i have met parents who make themselves victims on purpose and I have met parents who just dont know how to be a parent.   These parents have been in the \'autism\' world and outside the autism world.   As a parent YOU have to be the best you can be because out of everyone your child will meet, its you that is most important. If you buy the negativity of those around you and your child, your child and your own mental health will inevitably suffer.   The parents I know whose kids are doing exceptionally well, for the most part, were exceptionally \'good\' parents. Not heroes, not martyrs to the \'cause\' just good parents who let their kids live and just be and took every opportunity to develop their children\'s independence and personality - in this, autism didnt enter the equation - just the child. I have learned so much from these parents.   I suppose what i want to say here is that your child outgrowing autism is so very much up to you as much as it is up to the child.   I believe 100 percent my child will recover from the part of autism that might keep  him from having access to the world like everyone else. Do you know what I get from most people when I say this? Yes, you guessed it, \'she\'s in denial\', oh, pity her, she just doesnt understand etc etc.   those comments come from parents  which is very very sad.   We on this forum know differently though.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Well this is most certainly autism, no doubt. These are all stereotypical autistic behaviors. Almost all kids on the spectrum have some kind of sensory processing issues. High pain threshhold is common, as well as almost everything else that you said. I would get the official diagnosis as soon as you can, so you can begin the proper services. Depending on which state you live in, they will vary. You need to see a DAN doctor as soon as you can, and do some basic testing...urine, blood, stoll, etc... to see where she is as far as yeast, gut dysbiosis, food allergies, etc... It sounds like she has a lot of different issues. The good news is that when my son was diagnosed he had about 75% of the exact same issues as your daughter has, and almost all of them are gone. This is of course after 3 years of intense therapies, but it can happen. We are really looking at socilaization and playing now as what we are really trying to work on. He is in a regular class all day with a shadow, mainly for the social/play aspect, and he is really making huge gains in this area.  Many of his issues went away after implementing the right diet, the rest were with intense aba, private speech and OT, music therapy, social skills groups, biomed, and a great school program.  Don\'t feel discouraged, we are all here to help. The most important thing is to get the diagnosis so you can start therapy.  What state are you in?  Tanya</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Guest,  I have a first cousin who has autism who did have lack of oxygen at birth. His parents just say he is slow but now that I know about autism I am sure it is autism. He still lives at home, has a janitorial type job, has a drivers license and helps his mother, who is elderly, tremendously. He could have done so much more but they sheltered him too much (which I do understand).  As an infant our son would look up at the ceiling and move his head back and forth, had trouble nursing and then when it was time to wean had trouble with that to. He had difficulty going from one milestone to another, eating solid food, never crawled and didn\'t walk until age 18 months. Never liked baby games like peek-a-boo, infact if you sang he would scream. Large head too.    Maybe you would feel better if you took him for an infant evaluation at an autism center. They can do them at very young ages now. I\'m not saying he needs one I\'m just talking about piece of mind.

My son had delays since a very early age, and on top of that suffered a big regression as well, around 2.7. I can\'t imagine how it must feel like to have a completely typically developing child who regresses into autism.    In my son\'s case it really feels like his life began after that- around 2.9 is when he started regaining/gaining some skills, and he has progressed almost year for year afterwards- he never caught up with his peers, but he moved steadily forward, I have to remind myself to always subtract those first two and a half years of total developmental standstill when I think about his current developmental age <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /> (though he is age appropriate academically so far).  If you don\'t mind my asking- how old was your son when he regressed and did you associate it with something specific (like a vaccine, illness etc) ? I also have a 23 month old DD who does not have autism, but whom I am obsessively watching like a potential time bomb until she turns 3.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ \"When many cures are offered for a disease, it means the disease is not curable\" -Anton Chekhov</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ \"When many cures are offered for a disease, it means the disease is not curable\" -Anton Chekhov</div>'

David\'s mom,    I am so glad that you have family nearby to help out, and now with your daughter being old enough to help that must make it a little easier too.  Though it is still tough to do, isn\'t it!  Bless your heart doing everything you have to in order to take care of your family.    Dee\'s mom,    You seem to have found the ideal job and hours, that is so hard to do, so I am very happy for you!!  That actually is how my job started out, just a few hours 2 or 3 days a week.      Now I am the FT manager, I feel like I am in over my head, not that I can\'t do the job, but that work has trouble understanding that I may at times have my mind on other things, or I may be stressed from school IEP\'s or that I can\'t work because the therapist called in sick, you know?  They give me c--- for these things that pop up VERY infrequently.  For the most part I love my job and I love the paycheck, it is just when they seem so insensitive, but I know I am emotional and oversensitive, so I need to find that balance myself still.  Make sense??    C,    I know what you are saying  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /> With the new house we do need 2 incomes, just no way around that.   And I do wish I could be with D during the summer, but I will be working while he is doing his ABA in home therapy anyway, so I wouldn\'t necessarily be *with* him anyway during those hours.  But again, I know what you mean  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />     I feel like I made a mistake, that I misunderstood the *rules of parenting a special child*, that we are not to have a life, that we are to stay home, that we are to be broke.  I just can\'t do that and I (right now anyway) feel like I can\'t work FT without loosing my mind URGH!!

' <div class=\"postbody\">thanks for your post <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />  just curious - have you ever considered writing a book about detailing your methods of more typical communication - written to a fellow autistic?  i think that could be an incredible resource for our kids as they grow older.  from my perspective, the hardest part of having a child on the spectrum (now that health issues are not as much of a concern) is trying to get him sufficient therapies and the constant battle that comes with it.  it gets SO tiring always having to fight for what i know is best for my child.  i also find it troubling that he doesn\'t have any real friends, he doesn\'t have any real desire to play with other children.  and when he does attempt it, it is always inappropriate (as in, pulling hair to get attention or throwing a ball into the child, etc.).  my son is in incredible person.  over the last year and a half, he has gone from nonverbal to basic language (requesting, greetings, etc).  during this time we have discovered he knows his alphabet, numbers, colors, his receptive language is much larger than anticipated and we are beginning to see signs he can read - we did not teach him these things, but we are sure working on academic goals now!  he just turned 5 and up until 6-8 months ago, we had no idea he already had this wealth of knowledge.  he simply blows me away.  he also works harder than any other child i know (with the exception of some other autistic kids i know).  we are so incredibly grateful for every milestone he hits and for all of his accomplishments.  having a child on the spectrum has also really allowed me to appreciate my NT daughter\'s development.  she is 3 and the ease of which things come to her boggles my mind.  she has also been an incredible friend and model for my son.  1) how old where you when you began talking? i am very curious in the experience that late talkers have had and how aware they are/were of their inability to speak.    2) do you stim? did you stim? how helpful is it for you in your current life and your life as a child?  my son does a lot of stimming with his hands and it seems to be a need for him at this time.  he can\'t really express why he does it or what he gets from it, but i would sure like to know how it makes him feel.  we don\'t prevent him from doing it, but we do often redirect him, if possible.    3) did you receive a lot of therapy as a child?  if so, how did you feel about it?  my son does receive a lot of therapy and he also attends a private ABA school.  he seems to enjoy almost all of it - he seems to be really happy to learn and to be shown how to navigate his world in a way that he can make sense of.  but sometimes i worry that he has to work so hard and is he going to be resentful of this when he is an adult.  4) do you have any typical siblings? how is your relationship with them now, as adults?  thanks for putting yourself out there for us <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /></div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Yup,   Too many to list. It is scary, the things I catch myself doing that would be considered stimming. It is all JUST LIKE my son.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I agree that it could be caused by a need for communication. Have you heard of PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System)? Do you have a speech therapist that you and the teacher can consult with? I\'ve had experience with PECS with children who are nonverbal, high functioning, and extremely frustrated. It helps considerably b/c you can teach them to request specific items and they are immediately reinforced. Its great b/c its symbolic communication and it gives the child an opportunity to have a large vocabulary without the limitations of sign language (Poor fine motor and imitation skills). All you need to start is motivating objects, and two adults.    It also may involve receptive communication-he may not understand whats going on around him. I use picture schedules with my students with autism (age 3-7) and it helps considerably. When one guy starts acting hungry, about thirty minutes before lunch, I show him \"small group, circle, then lunch.\" It really helps him to know whats going on.    It may also be related to sensory problems. Does he cover his ears/eyes? It may be too loud and/or distracting, and causing him physical pain. Some kids with autism over-attend to some sensory stimuli or under-attend to sensory stimuli.    Best of luck =)   Grace (Special Ed. Preschool Teacher)</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">D is so funny (as I type this, he is singing Christmas carols at top volume from his bedroom  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /> ).    Last night, while doing his bedtime routine, D was saying \"Wallace and Gromit, the Curse of the WereRabbit\".  This is a movie he\'s pretty fixated on.  The whole point of this \"game\" is for me to copy what he says.  He likes it, as it feeds into his verbal stim, and also gives him the satisfaction of having his words/communication understood.  Sometimes I play along, often I mix it up, changing the rules of the game (make it into an opposite game, or an association game for example), and often I acknowledge him, while refusing to feed into the stim (\"Yes D, I heard you.\").    Anyway, in this case, I was teasing him a bit, refusing to say it \"properly\", instead saying \"Wallace and Gromit, The Curse of the <em>Kick-in-the-butt</em>\" (Kick in the butt is a \"funny\" statement for D).  At first he was frustrated, and kept saying, \"Noooo! Wallace and Gromit.  Curse of the <strong>WERERABBIT</strong>\" (in an irritated \"Duh! Mom\" voice).  I pulled his own sassy/bossy trick on him and would respond, \"unh-uh.  <strong>I TOLD YOU</strong>, Wallace and Gromit, Curse of the <em>kick-in-the-butt\"</em>.    I could practically see the little gears grinding in D\'s head, as he tried to figure out how to solve this dilemma.  I mean, here was mom, breaking all the rules, being a real party pooper, and yucking it up like it was no big deal!    Suddenly, he beamed a big grin, and blurt out \"Wallace and Gromit.  Curse of the <strong><em>Underwear</em></strong> Rabbit!\", then dissolved into giggles.    Yes, it\'s silly and assinine, but it was very appropriate 8 year old boy humor.  I thought it was GREAT!!! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /></div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">First, I would take her to your pediatrician to investigate any medical issues that might be causing this change in behavior. Because of her age, hormonal changes could be an issue, something to ask about. Your pediatrician should also be able to give you referrals to others in your area who could help your daughter.  If you can, take her to back to the neurologist she was seeing before (if you were happy with them). Since she did well in the past on an anti-depressant, it might be a good idea to start that again, that would definitely be something to ask the neurologist about. If the neurologist is not helpful you may want to consider taking her to a psychiatrist.  Have you talked to her teachers? Since she is doing well at school, maybe they have some ideas for you to improve her behavior at home. Some states have programs to send behaviorists to your home that would be something to look into, or if you state wouldn\'t pay for it, then you may want to see if you could find someone you could pay to come to your house if you are able. Your local autism society may be able to give you some ideas of people in your area who will do this.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello all!  I have just read all of this and wanted to add my two cents.  My husband and I had terrible marriage issues when all of this came about with our son.  I just thought he didn\'t care, the truth was that it all just scared him to death and he didn\'t know how to deal with it.  We ended up separating and to be honest it was the best thing.  We both realized what we meant to eachother and how much we missed eachother.  He now takes a very active role in my sons treatment.  He\'s even actually reading a book on biomed.  I think the biggest thing with him was that this is his \"son\", you know, the boy, the sports star, and that hit him hard. This is not a copout and I\'m not saying his reaction of ignoring autism was ok, but we all handle these things differently. All of us have vented in frustration and cursed autism at one point or another.  My husband loves my son with all of his heart.  He just had to understand that this was his son, that autism was his son and not the image of a sports star that he had in his head.  This is hard for all of us.  I will not sit here in judgement of anyone.  Good luck to anyone who is having a hard.time I have been there and it was the saddest time of my life, but now our marriage is rock solid and we are making a united front.     proudmom of bryce</div>'

The sad thing is he is such an intelligent man, but just doesn\'t seem to be interested enough in all of this to apply it to our son. That\'s my job, I guess. But I don\'t feel it should be . ..at all.   </div>    I can relate to this in that while my husband is extremely helpful and supportive, he\'s just not interested in the day-to-day details of therapy or supplements.  But I acknowldege it\'s difficult to change a lifetime of behavior patterns, so I look at where he\'s trying to help:  He does all the laundry (even folding!), and until recently was doing all the dishes, and the grocery shopping - and he makes sure all 4 pets are fed and still alive  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /> Those were things he felt he could control.  I also realized his knack wasn\'t in behavioral therapy with our son, it was taking our son out and showing him how to shoot a basketball or use a lacrosse stick - those were things he knew how to do well.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I might get lambasted by some for this loong posting this but I would just hope that when my son is an adult at whatever level of functioning, that people look at him foremost as a person who is just as entitled to have his voice heard as any other person.      It makes me sad to think that images of an autistic adult would bring anyone to tears.  I think this negative portrayal of autistic adults is the equivalent of posting a bunch of pictures of overweight people who aren\'t smiling and saying \"this is the tragic story of fat people - look at what weight gain has done to them, see how unhappy they are...\" (heard that analogy somewhere else re autistic people) - so based on a few pictures do we assume that all overweight people are unhappy?  Of course not.    Some parents of autistic children who post on this site will be faced with having a child that requires some level of long term care - does it always mean that the parents didn\'t biomedically intervene soon enough?  Didn\'t catch symptoms early enough? Chose the wrong behavioral approach? Not all kids are alike, and not all will respond to biomedical/behavioral the same way.     And for those who don\'t recover, we shouldn\'t look at them as sad examples or the tragic faces of autism - for all of us parents who are hurt when our children perform miserably on standardized intelligence tests when deep down we know our kids are smarter than what the diagnosticians are seeing, we are equally as guilty as the diagnosticians when we take one look at a person who appears severely autistic and assume he/she is unhappy, unintelligent, tragic, and by default has a poor quality of life.      I\'ve met several parents recently of adult autistics and I can tell you that they\'d be hurt and offended if I told them that merely seeing their child depresses me or makes me sad.    Here is from her site:    One father, meeting me, said,    \"You look like my son  But no.  But when you type.  You understand things.  But if I saw you in the street...  I wouldn\'t know.  I wouldn\'t realize.  But just looking at you.  You look just like my son.  Do you think my son knows more than I think he does?  Do you think my son could learn to type?\"    A mother, meeting me, said,    \"Seeing you type,  It shocked me.  I didn\'t realize people were still thinking when they didn\'t talk.  Do you think my daughter thinks?\"    A man, meeting me in public, said,    \"So what does that thing do?  It types?\"  (I said yes.)  He turned on a patronizing skeptical tone.  \"Can you tell me what we just saw then?\"  (Insulted, I did nothing, while my companion yelled at him that I could.)  He walked off muttering that he guessed I couldn\'t.    Then, always,    Are you okay?  No really, are you okay?  I\'m gonna go get help.  Staaaay riiiiiight heeeeere.  Iiiiiiiiiii geeeeeet heeeeeeeelp.  Goooood giiiiiiiirl.  Officer? I just found her, yeah.  Wandering around, she looks disoriented.  Is she okay? Will you come out and see?  (If I\'m lucky, I can leave before the cops come.)    And always, the conversation,    It starts without me.  They talk like I\'m not aware of them.  Then... I say something.  To mask their shock that the Thing can type.  They talk about how amazingly smart I am.  I wasn\'t aware that typing a sentence made me amazingly smart.  So I know they thought I was something else to begin with.  Something that does not even exist except in their heads.  But they would deny it to their last breath.  Being good shiny liberals, they don\'t like to look prejudiced.    LM</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">What you might want to do before you go is look up and contact the local chapter of the autism society of america and see if they have any informaition on which districts have better services.  Or maybe they know of an advocacy group who would certainly know which districts they have to battle on a regular basis.  Also There is a mentoring program I can\'t remember the name of (I\'m sure someone here can for me) for new parents and they might know who you should talk to.    Pluging into the local autism groups would be the best way to find out which districts are good.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">You know, this thread has me inspired again (and G-d knows I could use a little kick in the @ss myself).  I also lost 40 pounds a couple of years ago using WW and looked and felt so much better, but I\'ve had a really hard time getting back to that plan and counting points.  I am also a fan of SB and got the initial weight off after the birth of Little Man w/ SB diet, but then fell off the wagon again.  The nice thing about SB, outside of the fact that it is healthy, is that you do not necessarily need to limit the <em>quantity</em> of food.  So if you\'re a picker or a big eater, it might be worth a try for you.  I will say that though both programs worked (when I worked them), I found that I had more energy earlier on w/ SB and agree that it comes off faster initially.      I think it would be great to do it together.  Maybe we can set up a weekly virtual meeting to post about what worked and what didn\'t? Anyone?

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi respect don\'t give up. when evans was 9 yrs old my school distric did not want to give evans many of the things he was in need of to learn so i had to stay at home and  stop working. I did as you are doing with your baby now. I had to teach him to do his A,B,C,  Colors, sign to help him to communicate. Tactile language, to help him be more percetible to the sense of touch, clothing, Stop him from  placing poop all over him as Auntie said in one of the other post, cause he  would spread him self with feces all over his body. and all this was before i even knew anything of supplements, vitamins,  DAN doctors, GFCF diets. ects......     I felt as you do now very disorganised and had no idea what the ------- I was doing. And yes he was very UNCOOPERATIVE i think they know is mom so they take advantage of that  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /> but as you said it has to be done if  we want to see them advance and go forward.     I\'ll tell you a story. At that time i knew a mom who has  become my dearest friend today.  She had pulled her child out of school cause she was Autistic and the school was not teaching her to do nothing. she  did not know how to write, spell, get dress, tie her shoes, do math work, eat, ect. This mom was my inspiration. In  one year her child learn  how to do most of these things. Even thogh her child was asperger\'s  she gave me  the inspiration to teach evans and today you all have read on his progress. it\'s been a long road but if he has come this far how further can he go . Who know but i will not stop now.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />  so keep on swimming keep on swimming.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /></div>'

My son used to throw up from postnasal drip and a couple of times he breathed in the postnasal drip and got aspirational (I think this it he word) pneurmonia that landed him in the hospital. The Singulair has prevented the postnasal drip and stuffiness. It takes about a week or so to really reach a peak of effectiveness. For sleep, we use both melatonin and benedryl.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Here\'s a few that I use.  I just make ahead of the party and take a piece with us for Drew to have when the other kids are eating birthday cake.  The cake and pumpkin muffin recipes are yummy!      GFCFSF Lisa Ackermanâ€™s Chocolate or Carob Cake    1 cup white rice flour    Â½ cup sorghum flour (I use sweet rice sorghum flour)    1 cup sugar    Â½ cup cocoa powder or Chatfieldâ€™s Carob Powder    Â½ tsp. salt    1 teaspoon baking soda    1 teaspoon xanthan gum    Â½ cup oil (I use safflower oil)    Â½ cup hot water    Â½ cup milk substitute (I used prepared Vanceâ€™s Dari Free)    2 teaspoons GFCF vanilla    Preheat oven to 350 degrees.    Mix together dry ingredients and stir to combine.  Then add liquid ingredients and stir until well mixed.    Pour batter into a greased and floured 8x8 inch cake pan.  Bake for 30 minutes or until cake tests done with a toothpick. (Bake 20-25 minutes for cupcakes)          GFCFSF Flourless Peanut Butter Cookies    1 cup Peanut Butter  Â½ - 1 cup sugar  1 egg    Mix ingredients together in bowl.  Roll into 1 inch ball and place on ungreased cookie sheet.  Press fork into dough in crisscross pattern.  Bake for 7 â€“ 9 minutes at 375 degrees.  Cookie will be a bit crumbly at first but harden when cooled.  Take care when transferring from cookie sheet to cooling rack.          GFCFSF Donuts    1/3 c. Spectrum Palm Shortening  Â½ c. Sugar  1 med. Egg  1 Â½ cups GFCFSF flour   Â½ tsp. Baking Powder  Â½ tsp. Salt  Â¼ tsp. Nutmeg  Â¾ c. Pacific brand Rice Milk or Vanceâ€™s Dari-free Potato Milk    Coating:  Â¼ c. corn oil in a small bowl + a pastry brush (GFCFSF)  Â½ to 1 c. powdered sugar in larger bowl (for powdering the donuts)    Cream shortening and sugar together.  Add the egg and mix it up until smooth.  Add milk and mix gently to avoid splashing.  Add dry ingredients (not the â€œcoatingâ€ ingredients) and mix well.    Grease donut pans with either palm shortening or corn oil.  (I use corn oil on a paper towel because the pans are Teflon).  Do not overfill the donut pan pockets.     Bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean.  Remove from oven and allow to cool enough to handle.  Take each donut, brush on some corn oil to coat, and plop it into the confectionerâ€™s sugar.  Cover as best as possible, and they are ready to eat.      GFCFSF Pumpkin Muffins    1 c. sugar  1/3 c. oil (I use Safflower or Sunflower)  1 can Libbyâ€™s 100% Pumpkin  2 eggs (or replacement*)  1 Â½ + 1/6 c.

Place muffin cups in pan.    Mix wet ingredients and dry ingredients separately.    Combine and stir well.  Pour into muffin cups.    Bake until toothpick comes out clean, approximately 25 minutes.    Egg replacement:  (Add these to wet ingredients)  1 teaspoon arrowroot plus 2 Tbs. water equals 1 egg.    For second egg use 1 rounded Tablespoon of ground Flaxseed,   added to Â¼ cup hot water.  Stir and let steep for 3-5 minutes</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Anyone familiar with the Vineland test?    I dont post here often, but, I worry a lot about my four year old daughter.  Her speech is my main concern.      She passed her Vineland test.  She scored at her developmental age.  Even the speech and language part of the test.    Can a child with asd score well on the Vineland?  The evaluators made me feel that if she was asd, she would need to be developmentally delayed.    I have been confused for some time about her.  I just want answers, to know what direction her future will lead.      I always consider asd.  But, I also consider developmental language disorder as well.  Her language development fits the critera for asd - echolalia, memorized speech, etc.  She has overcome a lot over the last year and she is pretty much speaking spontaniously but you can still tell the difference between her and her peers.  Her language is more stock phrases, it does not sound as natuaral.  She does try though and she does talk a lot despite her problems.    Her social skills are ok, joint attention is strong and her eye contact is appropriate.  She has a best friend at school, she has language issues as well - they are both in a mainstream setting.    Another worry is a stim - when excited she clenches up, rubs her fingers and grinds her teeth.   She has done this since her first birthday - still going strong at four.  Although, I have learned she rarely does this at school.    Sorry for the long post - just wondering about the Vineland score - any advise, comments?    Thank you!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">I think you need to answer the question of whether or not you like teaching. If you do, then I see nothing wrong, especially in an educational setting, with letting people know more about you in this way. Just could tell them you need time to extra time to abosrb information and respond, more time than other people and leave it at that. Or more, depending on your comfort level with explaining your differences.   I think if you give them the chance to be helpful in terms of your needs, they\'ll feel happy about being able to help instead of confused about what they see in you. And, I\'m sure they see it, they just can\'t explain it.  </div>    Adults, yes. Students, forget it. Teenagers are too quick to look for wiggle room and control over authority figures. It\'s just in their genes. Everyone remembers how they saw authority figures when they were a kid. I hate to sound defeatist, but far be it from them to give me the momentary pause when they could use that moment to take advantage of me. I went in optimistic that this sort of thing would not happen, and that I could assume the best about junior high and high school kids, but it just ain\'t so. And if I cannot control my own class, I will not be an effective teacher, regardless of the support I have from my coworkers (and I have recently told my advisor as well as my supervisor about my situation in a confidential setting). Again I appreciate the support, but I can\'t be happy with my accomplishments until I can feel as though I fit in without trying to wear the figurative \"mask\" all the time.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ ~Nick    If it wasn\'t for sexual harassment in the workplace....

' <div class=\"postbody\">Today\'s IEP went like this.     Me:    DS\'s goals are too low.  I thought this back in July and told you by submitting 25 new ones.  Then I had an independent evaluation done and realized even the 25 I gave you weren\'t high enough.  Here\'s the report, we need new goals.  He probably had that entire <em>original </em>set mastered by the time he started school with you, according to the psychologist who did his independent evaluation.    School District:    DS is working just fine toward the <em>original </em>set of goals.  here are lots of fancy percentages to prove this.  They are <em>not </em>too easy.  We do <em>not </em>have to consider your independent evaluation legally but will look over it and come up with a few new goals.  We also have not looked over the 25 you submitted in July and by the way, the speech teacher can\'t make it to the IEP today, she\'s sick, but we think she\'ll probably <em>call </em>you.   Oh, and we want to discontinue your 1:1 ABA program.  Our SDC is just fine to accomplish this wonderful original set of goals and no 1:1 is needed.  So you can take the new goals we write and run them by your doctor at $150 an hour, which we won\'t pay for, and get her feedback, which again, we <em>don\'t </em>have to accept.  In fact, have her come to the next IEP, even though she lives an hour away and charges for travel time.  And remember, our reports from our district are what we go by, <em>not </em>your private doc\'s.

He can now do it on his own but it\'s more like walking instead of skating, at least he has learned to not rely on my hand to keep his balance. I would say let him do it at home as often as possible to help him practice. It\'s harder to learn when you go just once a week or so. Skating is hard!

When I\"ve tried to make a large list of activities and goals to work toward on any given day, hoping to maintain flexibility and choose from the pool of options, I find that I get overwhelmed by it at times and if I don\'t do the majority I feel as though I\'ve failed - or at least I\'ve been less than I could have been.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" alt=\":|\" title=\"Neutral\" />  I\'d probably be better of choosing just a few things to focus on in a given week, and might accomplish more by doing so.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" />     OK, I think I\'ve outdone myself with rambling thoughts and exposure of my issues for one weekend.

The goal is to make him understand that stimming is for this location only, and he will be expected to control it in all other areas.    I have read about this before. The young autistic man who does the speaking engagements - David Hamrick talked about this also that they taught him similar techniques growing up.    I can\'t help feeling that it\'s somehow cruel, though - stimming could be brought on by a biological reason - so now we\'re going to make him try to overcome that?     Any thoughts?

We see great progress for a few weeks at a time and then something happens and we take a few steps back. It has always been like this with every intervention we try. As bad as I want a miraculous healing, I am realizing that he is getting better with baby steps. He gets a little better each time and we have come so far from where we started. Try to always remember the progress you are making. It can be a frustrating journey but any progress takes you one step closer to healing.

Theres no secret im a big fan of Professional wrestling im like an encyclopedicia on it i grew up watching and Had the honor of meeting WWE (world wrestling entertainment)  Hall of famour Bret hitman hart at a convention im maryland over the summer as a present for my 20th birthday from my dad.        I have a framed picture with the man who is a true gentlemen in every sense of the word cares about his fans and has done vouleenteer work with the special olympics.  I overcame a compulsive shyness ive had my whole life when i shook his hand and said hi to him maybe no big deal for an NT but Nts are not autistic.     Autistics as many of you know have problems interacting with people and the world around them we can be very shut off from people which frusterates and saddens parents so i took my talking to him as a major accomplishement since he was the first wrestler i had ever talked to in all of my years of being a fan. i framed the picture and hung it in my room and sent him an email a few days later explaining who i was and that i had autism he sent a reply <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" />     Saying simply but kindly     Thanks for the support  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />   Bret    I have many young adult freinds at work and other places who love wrestling and believe it or not there are many challenged people who enjoy watching it i guess it just appeals to us.    I did a breif experience in January 2006  when i was 19    working on a ring crew fo  a small local promotion of wrestlers i was a little nervous but they were nice people setting up the ring was hard and im so small  5\'4 i thought i was going to break my back carrying n the pieces of wood and other materiel for setting it up and taking it down it was hard but i managed to do both.    but decided to retire from the buisness as i didnt make any money and wanted a simpler job    (i got home around 1 am that night so theres another reason right there)      In december me and my dear freind Jarred who has high functioning MR went to a local arena around here to see A WWE show  (i believe my 12 since 2002 maybe <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" /> )    On the drive up me and him his sister, Brother,and their freinds were laughing watching dvds in the van and having fun id gotten permission from my boss so id had the whole week off it was a bunch    of young adults NT and ND having a perfectly good time     <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\" />     it was the day after christmas and we were all enjoying ourselves we got caught in a traffic jam on the way to the arena but nontheless we had the trusty dvd player and a library worth of wrestling dvds (Wrestlemania 22 ) among others to keep us busy and  time literally flew i was just about to sugest to jarred to jump out of the car and get the traffic moving by doing his dead on wrestling impressions      (but still no where near as good as mine i aint letting him outshine me no way):wink:  When traffic started moving and we were on a way to the arena.      When we got in we were treated to a pretty good 2 hour show i noticed alot of people Adults and kids     with Autism/Downs/Mr in attendece all having a good time      (I cant explain it sometimes i can just tell by looking at a person whether they have autism or not) <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_question.gif\" alt=\":?:\" title=\"Question\" />  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" />   The main event was a cage match and even though it took over a half hour to set it up it was worth it in the end.

(Hi, I\'m an Aspie!)    We\'ve made a CD of music which we find to be \"therapeutic\" - and we\'re trying to share it with as many people on the spectrum as is possible.  If you like the 20 minutes or so of music that\'s available, and we hope you do, there\'s a super-easy way to get a free copy of the entire CD (or you can just buy one, which works too).    The first AutisMusic Project CD is a great draw for us, but the larger aim of the project is to bring together musicians from the spectrum to collaborate with one another and to have fun and build relationships with one another through making music (music which we\'ll compile into another CD project when the time is right - or music which you can keep all to yourself if you so desire).    If you\'re interested in music, either hearing or making it, and interested in autism (either having it or loving someone with it) we hope you\'ll visit our new website and forums - and participate by sharing some of your own music - listening to the music of others - and maybe even finding someone new to make music with!

Seems the neighbours took humbrance against our hedges and fence and decided to go at it and cut them down and broke the fence.     We have this fence and hedges to protect our son from wandering into their garden.     Well, i put a note in their door to ask why they did it and they arrived (hillbilly style) en masse, the mom, dad, 2 grown up kids and started screaming in the street at me about the note. Said they \"did me a favor\" by cutting the greenery down. Funny how they did it when i was away. They had 363 weeks during the year to have spoken to me about it    These are the same neighbours who thought my son was \"catchy\" and wouldnt let their newborn granddaughter visit in our house.     After the screaming, i told them about the need for security for our boy and they said \"that was an excuse!\"     Sheesh, how do you deal with this kind of behavior? The mom ripped my note up in front of me, threw it on the ground and stomped off muttering \"that\'s it\".  They have a big family and lots of kids, but you can\'t allow someone to bully you like this can you? This is a woman who has kissed my arse for the last five years all the time harbouring resentment.  YOu just never know about people do you?    time to move but where?

Michelle reads words accurately, but she can\'t comprehend the content. She has difficulty connecting to language she reads or language she hears. Words seem to go in one ear and out the other. People think she is not trying, and she has been labeled a \"motivation\" or \"attention\" problem. Many times this can be associated with those diagnosed with ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder), with or without hyperactivity.   Cause . . .  A primary cause of language comprehension problems is difficulty creating an imaged gestalt-a whole. This is called weak concept imagery. This weakness   causes individuals to only get \"parts\" such as a few facts or details rather than the whole picture.   Individuals with weak concept imagery have difficulty with reading comprehension, critical thinking, and may not easily follow directions or connect to conversations.  They may also have difficulty expressing ideas in an organized manner.  If they read well, but are severely unable to comprehend they may be labeled hyperlexic or high-functioning autistic, including Asperger\'s.      Symptoms . . .  Individuals of all ages may experience the symptoms of an undiagnosed and untreated concept imagery dysfunction. This causes:   â€¢Reading Comprehension  They have to reread material several times and often remember only a few details, rather than the \"whole.\" â€¢Oral Language Expression  They may seem shy and have difficulty organizing their language...or they may be talkative but scattered, relating information out of sequence. â€¢Oral Language Comprehension  They connect to only part of a conversation and have difficulty responding relevantly and thinking logically. They may ask and re-ask the same question and are labeled \"poor listener.\" â€¢Written Language Skills  Their writing is often described as unorganized and nonspecific.  Solution . . .  The NancibellÂ® Visualizing and Verbalizing for Language Comprehension and ThinkingÂ® (V/VÂ®) successfully stimulates concept imagery. Individuals become able to image gestalts which include color, and even movement. This improves their language comprehension, reasoning for critical thinking, and expressive language skills.    It is common for individuals to gain years in language comprehension in four weeks of intensive instruction.</div></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ B, 10, AS  LMB Bell V/V &amp; OCN, pragmatic lang, fiber, vits, avoid gluten, Nord Nat omega 3-6-9.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ B, 10, AS  LMB Bell V/V  OCN, pragmatic lang, fiber, vits, avoid gluten, Nord Nat omega 3-6-9.</div>'

We live in Long Island, New York and we have 3 year old twins named Sarah and Christopher.  While Sarah has not been diagnosed, Christopher was diagnosed with autistim about a year and a half ago and was in early intervention until he turned 3 in August.  He now goes to a school for Speech and Language Comm Development 5 times a week, in addition to home speech therapy, and OT.  I specifically noticed his actions changed after he had gotten the vaccination shot with Mercury, but I\'ll leave that for another post.    Christopher has been stimming excessively as of late.  He waves his hands across his face while his eyes follow his hands, he spins from time to time, he does inappropriate gestures with his hands (like moving them up and down quickly for no apparent reason), and likes to hit myself and wife with his hands whenever we are close to him, like changing his diaper.    I would like to know if anyone else has witnessed this and if so, are there things that my wife and I can do to help.  The school and home therapists say just to stop the action when he does it, but it seems to not be working and I think he\'s been stimming more as of late.    I would appreciate any help/advice and I\'m looking forward to chatting with everyone.    Thanks  Chris</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Well, I\'m so pooooooped out lately. We had the communion and then a wedding that evening. I got my \"friend\" (still don\'t consider it one) and I\'m finally feeling I have some energy back.     The priest had ordered some wheat free host and met with me before the ceremony. Bobby was with the children getting ready to line up. DH and I sat in the pew after talking to the priest. Once the ceremony started, the children walked down the isle and sat at the same pew as their parents but at the end. Another couple got in before us and was at the end next to our their son and ours so we were not next to Bobby. I kept looking over at him concerned he would do or say something and here these people had no idea what he was like.... I couldn\'t relax much at all. When we got up to take communion, I finally had a chance to talk to Bobby and tell him what to do but this was just seconds before we got to the priest to take it. I was certain he would mess up and fall apart in front of everyone. There were over 150 children there and all the parents. ugh Well he took the little container the priest had blessed with his GF host. I told him to open it up and take out his host and eat it. My angel. He did it. Thank God. By the time I sat down, I was shaking uncontrollably. I never had that happen before. It was a delayed reaction and I was shaking nonstop. It went away fairly quickly but if you saw me while it was happening, you most definately could see it.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" />     I was so glad it was over. I have to pay the priest for the host now. I know they want me to but I had so much to take care of and they got it at the last minute. I\'ll send a thank you card and some cash.

I didnt say anything about \"better\" parents, and just like you try to tarnish articles and pieces of research on this board, sometimes without even having read them, you are trying to put words in my mouth.     i think effectively, you are in your own competition to see how many people you can provoke and how many threads you can get locked.     I didnt see anything of merit in your last post. What was the point of it?    I found it mean spirited and totally out of sync with my intentions, thus, of no relevance to the topics at hand.

' <div class=\"postbody\">The best way to learn adding/subtracting and telling time is to do it.  Even if your child is a visual learner, it\'s easier to pick it up by using tactile activities.  I don\'t know how old your child is, but this is what I do with my 6 year-old and the kids I tutor.  For telling time, I use a home-made clock (have him make it out of a paper plate and some cardstock for the hands with a paper fastener so they can move).  Time is a hard concept, so it takes a lot of practice.      For adding/subtracting, I use a lot of games with objects like beans, dominoes, playing cards and GFCF chocolate chips.  If you want a list of games, I can try to send it to you.  Sometimes my attachments don\'t go through for some reason.  dory</div>'

This is actually from my father who has had mold allergies for most of his life until the last few years when he discovered this.  Two Vitamin C has been shown to lower blood levels of histamines.  Study published in the Journal of American College of Nutrition.  The recommended doseage FOR ADULTS is 1000 mg twice a day.  Three bioflavanoids specifically quercetin ups immunity and helps stop the production of histamines.  According to Dr. Marc Rothenberg M.D. PhD Allergy and Immunology Professor at the University of Cincinnati.   (Vitamin C with bioflavanoids was one of the first biomedical things we tried with our son at Tami\'s suggestion and we saw some real improvement which encouraged us to continue on that path)  Third I don\'t know if you want to try this on your kids but if you have allergies you might be interested Acupuncture.  NAET Nambudripad\'s Allergy Elimination Technique is supposed to start helping within 25 hours and in one study 66 percent had complete relief of symptoms after three months.   NAET.com    I was really excited when I found out this information I\'ve upped my vit C intake and noticed an increase in energy and decrease in runny nose and sneezing.      Anyway I posted this for those of us who would like to try alternatives to benadryl or other antihistamines (they knock me right out).</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi again    Biomedial intervention comes from the belief that in many cases autistic-like symptoms are actually caused by biological issues such as yeast overgrowth in the intestines, or a whole bunch of other things (vitamin deficiency, viral issues.)  If you treat the underlying medical problems, which are not always obvious until you really start digging and testing, you will see a reduction in autism symptoms.    Behavioral intervention does not refer to misbehavior but rather to <em>human behavior </em>that \"typical\" people pick up without thinking.  Stuff like making eye contact when you talk, or sharing experiences with someone just for the joy of sharing and not just using them as a means to get your needs met; these things need to be taught to someone on the autistic spectrum.  Behavioral therapy works great on kids who don\'t have autism too, just teaching them clearly how to act.    The mercury/shots theory is that some kids are not able, biologically or genetically for some reason, to excrete the mercury preservative they use(d) in childhood vaccinations.  When these kids get their MMR shots at 18 months, their little immune systems are so overwhelmed already by all the stored up metal in their little bodies from all the shots that the MMR shot, with 3 live viruses, sends them into autism.  The MMR shot itself has no mercury, it\'s more like the straw that broke the camel\'s back.  The last straw.  But not all kids have the problem excreting the mercury to the point where the MMR causes autism, so not every kid who gets vaccinated becomes autistic.  And I believe some kids are born with the symptoms.    This quote of yours caught my attention:<div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">She was a very fussy baby from the time she was born. They diagnosed her with colic and milk allergies at around 2 months. She also had acid reflux pretty bad.</div>  Dietary intervention for autism operates on the fact that gut issues are very common for children with autism.  It takes that fact one step further and says that the gut is actually permeated, allowing bad things through, and that what gets through contributes to the autistic symptoms.  The two biggest offenders are gluten and casein, or more simply put, wheat or dairy.  For a kid with autism, these foods can contribute a great deal toward their symptoms.  Parents of kids with autism frequently eliminate these things from their diets to let their \"guts\" heal, thereby keeping out what is making them feel so spacey.      Your description of your daughter\'s sensory issues, language issues, and the fact she has milk intolerance and \"gut\" issues are all red flags to me.    Early Intervention should pay for some behavioral therapy but the dietary intervention and biomedical intervention, should you need them, are up to you to fund.    I wish you lots of good luck and hopefully she is just a sensitive child.  But please don\'t wait too long, every day counts if she does need the help.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">What a wonderfully insightful topic.  We are working with a new \"behaviour Modification specialist\" she noticed that Luke is \"scared\" of new things, she introduces things now very gradually...first of all her only requirement it he watch, nothing more, then he will do alittle more the next time.  When he gets to the point of \"fright, flight, or fight\" she brings her goal all the way back down to simply \"just watching\", that way he knows he can not do something else until the task is completed, but she has not totally let him have his own way....so one might think that he would just throw alittle tantrum and get to sit there, well at first yes he did, but very quickly he figured that it gets pretty boring just sitting there, and so now he joins in when he is given that choice.  It took only 6 sessions to completely get his co-operation.    Another thing I find very helpful for Luke is that we always have a favourite thing (a reinforcer if you will) that he is told about, eg: first do board game, then choose a toy to play with from the shelf.  In the beginning he would not get a choice of what his reinforcer was, it would be very specific, but now that he is complying more he gets more choices, that in itself is more independent, don\'t we as adults pick our own reinforcer, eg: when I lose those 5 lbs I will buy myself those new jeans...  Also, I see this method as something that is very easy to transfer to home and to school.  Luke is in kindergarten, but when he was 4 years old and we started working with him, we had another consultant and he taught us a great method called \"pre, show, post\"....this simply is tell the child the expectation and consequence for non-compliance (keep it simple so he can be successful while teaching the method of course), then during the \"show\" the actual challenge, then it is lots of reminders, praise if doing it successfully and remind of consequence if does not comply, then follow through with consequence if non compliance, then when child calms comes \"post\" simply, the child is told what happened, what was asked, what was told would happen if did not co-operate, and what then happened, and then the child is told they will try to do it better (not right) the next time.  Ideally the next time is the next day, and this time at \"Pre stage\" the child is told what happened the day before and that today he will try to do it \"better\".  We found this method worked really well for going places because the consequence was either \"leaving\" or \"going to sit in the car\".  We have used this for trips to the beach, the park, swimming pool, supermarket, movie theatre, etc\".... infact we still use it to this day for new places, or for some of those places that we know may be a challenge for him.  It\'s really simple to learn and use and incorporate into everyday life, it is not a method to be taught at a table, more within the community, but what does work well is that it is so transferable and you don\'t need any equipment to do it either.    I go not so much for complaince, but more about \"completion of task\"...  At Luke\'s school they also taught him to say \"I need a break\", he is allowed to go and have a break in a certain area and a timer is set for him (we use timers for transitions too), he also has been taught that he must then return to the task and complete it.

You should definately hang out with little David some more, he probably doesn\'t have many/any friends, school sounds like torture for him, to hang out with someone who just understands what his life is like would be amazing for him, I bet you\'ll literally see him relax right infront of your eyes.  When Luke first started hanging out with other kids who had challenges you could see him relax, when he\'s at school, he is surrounded by kids who totally understand when he is having a melt down, and he understands when they have one...I know that a school of choice is not for all kids with challenges, but for those kids who are not thriving in the public school system it is a place that they can feel included, feel safe and actually learn.    Vancouver school board are trying to get a public funded school of choice set up and it makes me sick that so many people are against it, they say that it will lead to segregation, and that all the challenged students will be dumped in the school, but that it simply not the case, the idea is in the name \"Choice\" for children who find school a difficult place they and their families need an alternative and home schooling is not always an option, a centre where the child can thrive, have friends and be around other children who understand and can share similar experiences, smaller class sizes, higher student to teacher ratio, more qualified and experienced staff, more opportunity to learn, available resources to get therapy in the school environment, what is so wrong with that...I just don\'t understand the parents of children with special needs here in BC, they would still be able to send their kids to the local school if they are doing well in that environment, the school of choice is for families who want to choose.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Yes, I think of it as two steps forward one step back.  It can be very frightening.  He progesses in one area and loses just a bit of ground in another.  We\'ve actually seen a pattern of regression followed by big gains.      It use to be very obvious, every few months, S. would regress in his speech and have increased stims and then a few weeks later, he\'d regain all the ground and show a huge increase in social awareness and language and a huge decrease in stimming.  Does anyone else\'s kid do this?  The pattern has become much more subtle over the past year.  We\'ve seen more modest gains without the regression.  But, from the age of 2 1/2 to over 5 this was how he progressed.    We\'ve also seen regression with ear infections, dietary infractions, and hurt feelings.  Yes, hurt feelings, it\'s like living with 12 year old girl.  I wish, wish, wish he had never learned that phrase.  Though, I was reassured to learn that his best friend at school uses the phrase.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">sometimes i have caused regression in my son when i tried a new treatment. i\'ll never forget how well my son was doing on allergy drops, but i stopped them to try the naet. he regressed so badly that he looked autistic every single day. how i cried for my \"old\" joshua to come back to me, because i didn\'t know what was causing the regression. i finally realized that it was the removal of those allergy drops. i didn\'t realize how much they contributed to his well-being.      other times he has regressed after starting with a new doctor, and the doctor tried a treatment that didn\'t work well for him. or other times, he would regress before he would get better, like when he started anti-fungal treatment. that was a scary time, but he got much better.      so if your child regresses for whatever reason, the key is to find the reason for the regression, and then work to correct it. my son has had many regressions over the years, but he has always come out of them stronger and better.      totally off of the topic; he went to a halloween party last night. he picked his clothes with care, got dressed, and ran out of the house. at the door he turned around and asked, \"do i look cute?\" my heart melted, and i said, \'yea, but you always look cute!\"  terresa</div>'

The bus driver and aid said that she was sleep and they were going through a speed bump and the window seal (?) hit her. She really doesn\'t think that was the case. She is so sure that her daughter might have not been buckeled at all. They put a harness (vest) on her and it shouldn\'t be loose that she has bruises. She also sits at the edge of the seat, not by the window. When she calls the bus depot they said the vest was too big for her. she has been riding the bus for a year and my friend fuss so many times for them to provide a car seat for her daughter. they kept saying she is 41lb and she should be okay with only the vest. Now they are saying it was big for her. so they have to wait until a major accident to happen so that they can find out the vest was too big? are they kidding? what if they happen to be in a crush (god forbids) will she survive? would they come back again and say \'oh we didn\'t realize the vest was too big for her, we should have provided a big kid car seat?\" it\'s neglegence to me.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello all. This is my first post here.    After a few days of reading the board, I finally decided to post. There was another post very similar to what I am about to write, but I am a different person with a different set of problems.    I am literally weeping as I type this...    My wife and I are worried sick about our 23-month old. His daycare teacher recently alerted us to the fact he really wasn\'t communicating like the other kids. So we contacted, and qualified for, early intervention. After initial evaluation, he was delayed in both expressive and receptive language skills.    We have scheduled him for an autism evaluation by one of the the leading evaluators in the state. This will be done in July. I am so frightened by the potential diagnosis, I can barely function.    While he shows some mild behavioral signs of autism, it\'s nothing severe and probably would not even be noticed if not for the language delay.    The bottom line, as least for us, is we are so consumed with grief and worry, we can\'t even function. I made the mistake of spending countless hours at night pouring over abstracts, clinical studies, warning signs, etc. One minute I am convinced he is autistic, the next minute I am certain he is not. Every single thing he does that could be constituted as a \"red flag\" sends a chill up my spine. Are these true symptoms, or just regular toddler behavior? Has my research caused me to over--analize?    What to do? The kid makes great eye contact, smiles in response to a smile, plays with most toys in the proper way (although he does like wheels), exhibits no ritualistic behavior, actually enjoys being taken out of his routine and pretty much seems to be a normal little boy, save the language delay.    I am not asking for replies to make me feel better just for the sake of feeling better, but......please help. To make matters worse, we are pregnant with our second and can\'t even look forward to the birth for worry over our son and worry the new baby may be impaired as well.    I have a feeling he will be diagnosed as being somewhere on the spectrum. The thought of this makes me physically ill.    Can he live a normal life? Can he go to regular schools? Will he go to college? Have a wife and children?    I also worry about the stigma attached to the word \"autistic\" - something that will follow him for his whole life.    Replies are appreciated.</div>'

It\'s a hard topic to discuss but important for their safety.    <a href=\"http://www.researchautism.org/resources/reading/documents/BestOfOARacle.pdf\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.researchautism.org/resources/reading/documents/BestOfOARacle.pdf</a></div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">We taught our daughter to ride a tricycle by having her sit with her feet on the peddles.  Then we would put our hands on the peddles where her feet were and we would slowly move the peddles in a circular motion while her feet were still on the peddles. This moved the trike forward.  Very slowly of course.  Sometimes we had her feet on the trike and we should push from her back.  After A LOT of repetitions (about two weeks - maybe more), she got the hang of it and became really good at turns, stops, going backwards.  Don\'t despair.  They will get the hang of it with enough practice.  One day soon it\'s going to click for them and you\'ll seem them whizzing around the house and yard.  I don\'t know if this makes a difference, but we have smooth tiles downstairs so she learned to ride the trike inside the house.  That gave her a lot of opportunities to practice at all hours of the day without any regard to weather.   This is the trike she has.  It\'s a classic Radio Flyer from Wal-Mart. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.walmart.com/ip/Radio-Flyer-Classic-Red-10-Tricycle/12389167\">http://www.walmart.com/ip/Radio-Flyer-C ... e/12389167</a><!-- m --></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #800000\">There are many paths to autism.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi LBP.  I\'ve been off the boards for a few days but since I\'m sitting here at 1:30 a.m. unable to sleep I thought I\'d check in.  Thanks for asking.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />    We are in litigation and it\'s stressful.  I wish I could say more.    It just floors me, as I look through thousands of pages of documents, how people in the field of special education can care so little sometimes about whether or not what they are doing for a child is actually right for that child.  Seems like they send them through an autism program assembly line, railroad parents who are desperate and frequently very naiive, rubber stamp a course of action for the kid, then immediately start collecting evidence against any challenges.    I guess it\'s a vicious cycle.  They fear litigation so they circle their wagons and cover their a$$es as soon as possible, but if they didn\'t do that then there wouldn\'t be so much cause for litigation.    Grr.    But I do appreciate you checking in.  No current therapist horror stories to share but I\'ll let you know. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />     On a happy note, we\'re currently in an \"up\" period with my DS, I love these times with lots of language and interaction.  I try not to wonder how long it will last. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" />   It kills me because the timing couldn\'t be worse.      I just saw your thread about Where\'s Waldo.  I\'m headed there next and I\'m super, super happy you posted it, because I have thought that type of thing could be a helpful therapy tool.  But I ran it by my ABA supervisor and she didn\'t \"get it...\"  (\"Sure, you could definitely look at those books with him, it\'d be fun!\")  So I kind of let it slide...</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">My son has not started ABA yet. He had to meet with a psychologist today so she could get an idea of where he is cognitively. He just turned 4- did anyone have to go through this before they started ABA? She was having him point to letters, numbers, e.t.c   He became very bored with this. I left the room for a while and she came out with him in like 15 minutes and said he appeared to not be feeling well (he did have a cough) and asked to re-schedule. She said he was complying but it was kind of half heartily. I wanted to say that he was probably getting bored. She said the evaluation takes like 3 hours, please tell me she was not going to expect him to sit at this little table for 3 hours and do drills.     I asked her what if next time he does not cooperate with her.  She said she gets all kids to cooperate......okay.    While I do see some benefits of ABA, I told her that my concerns with my son are more of his play skills (or lack thereof)and interacting with people. It seems that ABA focuses a lot on rote and academics. My son is very strong in those areas. She said that the goals are based on what areas your child is lacking in- it could even be potty training or self feeding, is this true?    I don\'t want to make the wrong decision. I just want to make sure that my son receives the most appropriate therapy for him. Any input is appreciated.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">My son is in a spec. ed. HS.  He reads at the 3rd grade level, with comprehension, and does math without a calculator through division and can apply the operations to word problems as long as the word problems are at a language level he understands.  He is not at a discrete trial level.  The consultant who suggested the ABBLS assessment (the consultant who is no longer available to us) thinks that the our son\'s language issues are because therapists in the past pushed him along, since he could \"get\" higher level language skills without REALLY being sure that all the basics skills were mastered.  His recommendation was to use the ABBLS assessment to try to try to tease out the deficits.  However, the idea was to use the ABBLS to come up with the IEP goals, not actually to use discrete trial. I am confused as to what to make sure the District tells the spec. ed. HS to do.  Also, the ABBLS assessment was done nearly a year ago.  I think some of the assessment was incorrect anyway since it was done by people who didn\'t know him all that well (long story).  How often is an ABBLS assessment done?  Is it used outside of an ABA program?  I am desperately trying to find ways to help our son\'s expressive language. He has a pretty normal vocabulary, but he can\'t get a handle on grammar and syntax in normal speech, so he oftentimes throws bunches of words that have to do with the thing he wants to talk about together and hopes for the best. The BAD part is that many people actually UNDERSTAND what he\'s getting at, so the incentive to speak properly is weak.  I\'m feeling lost about what to do to help (BTW, he\'s been getting 5 days a week of speech therapy for nearly 13 years and he\' STILL on the 5yo level with huge splinters).</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Rainman,    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">its the people around the child who suffer and not the child himself because the child is isolated and cant understand what he is doing wrong or that he is not living up to others expectations.  That is the cruel irony of autism not what happens to us but the people around us. </div>    I really like how you said that. Sounds like a lot of the troubles you faced weren\'t because of your autism, but how other people treated you. In my family one of my parents was not that accepting of me and wanted me to be like a normal kid, and that parent really was unhappy and suffering because of it (we\'re finally getting along better now that I\'m older). My other parent always accepted me for who I was, and the two of us were happy and got along great. It\'s part of the reason I\'m against trying to cure autism, since I\'ve seen how unhappy wanting that makes people, and also how happy acceptance can make people.    I also agree that not all challenges are bad, and can make people stronger. You seem like a very good and strong person.     Anyway, I hope you feel better soon.</div>'

They do snacks that are on the diet and everything.  I consider myself very lucky and I truly believe that being around typical children truly has made a difference in my son.  Like I said before, he has friends, one in particular, who just really love him.  For some reason there is this other boy who has really taken to Bryce.

My son has health insurance through Pa and private through my husbands workplace.  Do you have that out there too?  My son is in a private school for autistic children.  He\'s low functioning.  The student teacher ratio is very very high.  2 to 1. This is paid for by the school district too.  My son also gets home hours with a tutor paid for by the state, Dept of Public Welfare, 18 hours of services a week total.  My son also has MR diagnosis.  There is very little money he gets for this but a couple hundred is better than nothing.  What is it like accessing services out there?   What is it like out in Indiana or even Kentucky?  My husband works in Mount Vernon Indiana close to Evansville.  Can someone give me some insight as to what basically goes on?  What is life like out there in Indiana?

' <div class=\"postbody\">Dearheart,    My son is 8 years old and he is VERY high functioning.   He started talking around 2 and did minor hand flapping.  He was very social (unusually so, I would find out later), had decent eye contact and had great pretend play.  So we didn\'t have many red flags when he was very young.   He started having trouble socially when he was at an age where he was expected to play with kids independently (2 1/2-3).  He would grab them and want to touch them all the time, and his lack of social skills really showed through, but I had now idea what that meant.  Everyone told me he was immature and he would learn to stop behaving this way.  We had him evaluated at 5 1/2 and we were told that he did not have Aspergers (I think he does).  He doesn\'t fit the typical mold.  They recommended OT for the sensory issues (touching the kids too much) and social skills classes.      We have done MB12 shots, GF diet and Liver Life.  We have seen gains with each.  He no longer touches others inappropriately and his social skills have improved.  He still has a ways to go, but I see a light at the end of the tunnel.      What I\'m trying to say is, just because your son is social and has good eye contact and likes pretend play doesn\'t mean he\'s not on the spectrum.  My son doesn\'t have trouble transitioning and that was a major reason they did not classify him.  They were not interested in his loose bowel movements.    Going to see a DAN doctor was a great thing for us.  It was wonderful to see a doctor who put all of my sons symptoms together and finally saw Autism.  I know that sounds crazy, but I KNEW!  Now I knew we could start recovery.    It\'s a long road, but so worth it.    Liz</div>'

The Hanen approach has some really useful tips for increasing language in your child, speak lots to your child, depending on what you are trying to achieve will dictate how you interact with the child.    Post about what you feel your child needs to work on right now and I am sure that there are other people on this site who can give some useful pointers in how to encorporate tasks to get the concept across.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Please understand I don\'t mean to say there\'s only one way to learn.  This is how it works the majority of the time with NT kids.  When I think about it and add on the auditory difficulties ASD kids have, as well as the rigidity about changing an approach once it\'s been learned and in place for a long time, it seems to me that an ASD child might not want to go backward and relearn willingly.  But just like everything else, each of us is different, and if it\'s worked for others, that\'s great.  I\'ll duck out now, but best of luck to everyone. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /></div>      <span class=\"gensmall\">Last edited by <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8&amp;sid=ddd8aa22bbb94ce8b75a49a5774b6416\">MCA</a> on Fri May 04, 2007 5:52 pm, edited 1 time in total.</span>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I, too, wonder if your daughter has been evaluated for apraxia, specifically because you mention her saying words once but not being able to repeat them.  This is a very common scenario with apraxic kids. It\'s like they can\'t remember how they were able to physically form the word the last time, though the sound may be perfectly clear in their own head. I believe I\'ve also read about some tendency to whisper words as well.

I\'d second the suggestion of using the flushing as a motivator, you may need to let him flush for going into the BR at first, and then again for going, but it will probably work well once he understands what he needs to do.

Anyway, the package arrived today and when my DS opened it he was upset to discover that in the Queen box was a different Barney video.  I feel sure it was an honest mistake and I\'ve emailed the seller, but he is so upset.  He has calmed down a bit now, but he banged his head and screamed off and on for hours after the mail arrived today!

I feel like the people who want to go out and tell people about Jesus, and knowing Jesus is the only way to save them, and that they need Him... and they want nothing to do with the cure.  The one thing they need the most, they turn away from.    So I go tell people about their kids being poisioned...about a possible solution, something they can just \"try\"...and it is \"TOO HARD\" or they just don\'t want to bother.    It just blows me away...I just cannot fathom someone not even wanting to TRY.  The other option is a  lifelong disability..  the other...possible reovery.    I just don\'t get it.  Yet, I keep going...trying to let people know.

Kind of similar to the ABA you parents use with some of your kids But it had a different name and was meant for dominent basset hounds.

' <div class=\"postbody\">It is SOO overwhelming.  I never feel like I am doing enough.  ABA, ST private twice a week, OT private twice a week, special ed with ST/OT through school.  Not to mention hours on line.  Wreaked havoc on my marriage.  Church was difficult to attend for months.  And the money--we will never be able to retire.     My child is 5 1/2, was diagnosed at 3 yrs 9 months.  He did have verbalizations, and I could understand about 1/4 of what he said, but was at about an 18-24 month old level.  He was the kind to where everything was difficult--getting in and out of a car, changing his diaper (toilet trained at 3 yrs 6 mos), even watching TV if you didn\'t repeat things like he wanted.  And he was a major hitter--he would hit us several times a day.  With transitions, changing clothes, anything.      Fast forward 2 years almost to the DAY (6/10).  He is getting ready to start \"typical\" private kindergarten.  He talks all the time, though is still delayed compared to his peers.  He ties his shoes, dresses himself, has little friends.  He does karate.      I will never forget the day he started real pretend play.  Sitting at the table with Winnie the Pooh, he said \"Come on pooh, are you hungry?\"  Not long after that, he commented on my shirt \"I like your yellow shirt.\"  There is a language delay and it wasn\'t said perfect, but it was so awesome.       You can do it.  Get in on a good group (this group is awesome) where you can vent, research modalities.  Look on youtube under autism recovery (or something similar).  Get on Talk About Curing Autism--they have recovery videos there.  Dr. Neubrander\'s website is great, too.  I watch those videos and it just fires me up to do even more.

' <div class=\"postbody\">your child\'s symptoms are alarming and are of concern.  In my experience, lack of language at age 3 is the first area of concern, and a red flag.  Second, your child is showing lots of rigidity.  This rigidity is a huge issue, and needs to be addressed.  I know, because im in similar situation with my son.  my son had big time rigidity issues, and suffers from a lack of speech.  My speech therapist has diagnosed him as having a very mild form of autism.  My doctor has said, he is fine and would not worry about it.    My advice to you is to be very proactive.  relatively minor changes in diet can have a huge impact on behavior and speech.    I would recommend a GFCF diet asap.  After a month of GFCF, I would add other supliments.  We just started him on Cod liver oil and it has made a noticable difference in his behavior.    My goal with my son who is borderline, Is to hopefully keep off the spectrum.  after my research, I believe that relatively small changes can have a huge impact.  Good luck, and if you have any questions, shoot me a pm.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">David,    I think most parent accept their children. For some who are more severly affected than you are, the parents would want to raise the childs level of functioning so that they can be at least independent when the parents are no longer around to care for the child.    For others who experience regressive autism, they feel that the child was developing normally and something interfered and would like to restore that which they had before. This does not mean they do not accept the child, but it does mean that they will try to find out what happened to the child and treat those issues that caused the regression.     Parents love their children. They are doing the things they feel will give the child the best chance in life at being happy.    For some children, the symptoms of autism can disappear. I have too many children that have lost the diagnosis at our clinic to believe that once autistic always autistic for all people affected with autism. But for many who come to our clinic, autism will always be a part of life. For these we can try to lessen the severity and grant more functionality to the child.    I think that as a person grows up with autism, they become comfortable with it and how it effects them. Autism does not define the person, but autism can effect how a person relates to others and their environment. From my reading of your entries, you are a caring and compassionate person. Autism does not define that, your character defines this for you. Autism though does seem to define some of the sensory issues you have. You have learned how to relate and deal with autism. But your character has defined how you deal with others.    Your character is your greatest asset. This is what you bring to the table that parents on this board are attracted to. Your views on autism greatly help parents who seek to understand how their child relates. You are providing invaluable information for parents in giving perspective on autism and how it affected you.    What I find really unique is that you are not condeming parents for trying to help their children overcome the issues that autism presents. Even though you do not wish to be \"cured\" you are not condeming parents who are seeking to overcome autism. I often hear people with autism advocate acceptance but are intolerant of accepting a parents wishing to help their child. David, you are one of the very few I have met who practices true acceptance.     I feel priveleged to have met you and I think this board is a better place with your input into the issues facing parents today.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">You usually start in the room for a child who stims all day what would they care.  Then you can adapt to the child.  Some children have never been to a park as they are not functional once the child goes to the park you let them lead.  You do not end up spending all of your life in the room.  One thing I remember from the book was that once they started eating dinner at the table with him if he was stimming they would do it too.  The whole family.  If he wanted to run around the table they let him.  Their son now runs the Sonrise program and would be in his late 30\'s about my age and he has no signs of ever having Autism.  They also let their son mentor another child with Autism they worked with.  He was very helpful and understanding and still a child himself at the time.  I totally recommend the Book Sonrise.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Tami,  I just remembered this....    About 3 or 4 yrs ago (Bobby was probably 4 or 5) I put Bobby in a pre-school sports vairety type class thru the YMCA. The teacher there is suppose to be the best, works really well with the chidren... I used to jog around the gym they had class in so I was always there watching him as I went around and around. SO... one day the teacher came up to me with a very stern look on her face and was MAD. She said, \"Bobby said the S word today.\" I was SHOCKED. I didn\'t know what to say and I felt so ashamed and wondered why he would say such a thing. She said, \"we don\'t allow that word here...\" I said I would talk to him (what else can you say) and she added, \"we don\'t allow the word stupid to be said here.\" Well... as you can imagine my face must have shown every sign of RELIEF all over because the teacher became even MORE ANGRY and said, \"well WE don\'t allow that word here or at MY HOME. WE don\'t allow it...\"    It did bother me that I was reprimanded as if I was a bad mom and at the time I did not know Bobby was asperger\'s so I really didn\'t have anything to say but \'I\'m sorry\' and \'I\'ll talk to him\'. If I knew he had asperger\'s I could have easily told her that he has trouble holding back his emotions...     After all this time what I learned....

And there you were witnessing the whole thing. She probably wanted to avoid any more conflict.     One thing is for sure, that sing song thing would have totally aggravated me but you handled it real well!

We had to stop asking this child over but not really because of the child but because the mom who never, ever reprimanded her son when he and my son had \'fights\', and they had plenty. One time her son faked tripping and crying to act as if my son did it. I saw the whole thing from beginning to end. I told the child to get up and Bobby didn\'t trip you... stop telling lies. If he told his parents, I\'m sure they figured I had it wrong and their son was right. I\'m very sure of that. Another time my son fell at their house and I had to go pick Bobby up. The little boy kept screaming it was Bobby\'s fault. Oh! My son\'s kness were dripping a huge stream of blood down his leg into his sock and shoes and the mom said NOTHING to her child to stop. I kindly said to him \"it\'s ok, kids get hurt and it\'s nobody\'s fault. It\'s ok...\" Finally the grandma told the boy in a very stern voice \"stop it, be quiet, stop it....\" I can tell you many stories of how this child tried to get my son into trouble. I don\'t understand why but I noticed this behavior with certain ADHD children. Anyway, I used to need at least 2 weeks off from playdates after having this child over and there was no special thanks or fairness from this mom. It got to the point, there was no positive in getting these boys together at all espcially when Bobby would celebrate when he left  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /> so I stopped inviting him and that was it.     Now we have another mom with a child diagnosed with ADHD and has the same behaviors as the first child I described BUT the mom is fair, willing to reprimand her son when he does wrong. It\'s a whole different thing. She\'s not ingoring bad behaviors AND she told me about her son\'s condition. This is a much more healthy situation and Bobby can see the other mom reprimand the other boy when he says or does something wrong. It\'s still not easy to deal with this child BUT I know it\'s appreciated and also i know the mom will understand if I need to talk to her child if he does something wrong.     As long as that teacher works with you on these issues including her own adopted son, you will make it through just fine.    Well I rambled on again... hope this makes sense!     (HUG)  audrey  p.w. You\'ve worked so hard and your such a good mom. Take care and don\'t let things get to you that shouldn\'t. It\'s not worth the time.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ B, 10, AS  LMB Bell V/V &amp; OCN, pragmatic lang, fiber, vits, avoid gluten, Nord Nat omega 3-6-9.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ B, 10, AS  LMB Bell V/V  OCN, pragmatic lang, fiber, vits, avoid gluten, Nord Nat omega 3-6-9.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">It\'s like I\'ve always said, many times it TAKES intelligence to recognize intelligence.  Poor babies.  Teach him to spell, words do not fail my son.  He relies on them. He asks \"What does that spell?\" constantly.  Teach him to read as early as you can, bypass the auditory processing difficulties.    I too have made that observation in the parents of the special needs kids I have personally talked to or at school meetings, on this board, etc.  Definitely above average in intelligence.    Our poor babies.  I am so angry how they\'ve been so robbed and not all have the fortune of having parents that are try so desperately to help them regain function. The Gavins, the Rys, the Bobbys, the little herbs, the Alexes, etc all have exceptional parents that are giving them a voice. God only knows how many countless are being tucked away, warehoused, forgotten like throwaway children, damaged little dolls with glassy eyes and blank stares.  Put Jr. in the attic.    I had my second pediatrician show me the door.  Told her off in person, by fax and soon by certified mail.  My boy has been having serious regression the likes which of haven\'t seen in a very long time due to IMO yeast? and she wouldn\'t even order tests to show mineral levels or yeast.  His growth has been slowing down somewhat. Doing this c--- on my own, blind, except with the help of a few of the generous terrific Moms on this board.  Ped said she \"wasn\'t going out of her way\" Said all those theories were \"conjecture\".  Told her she was refusing to treat a very physically sick child and there was no justification for it, NT or not. Physically ill is physically ill. I told her there was more than enough hard science out there but she was making  a business decision at the expense of my son\'s health and physical well-being.I told her it\'s much easier be dismissive than to face the fact that she had pushed the poison like a good AARP soldier if that helped her sleep at night.  All for that end of the year vax co. bonus. Told her that you people inject them with poison, damage them, and then dismiss them with a wave of your arrogant hands. In summary, I told her and told her and told her....If I sounded like a rabid dog it\'s cause I feel like that and yes, I know I  need to channel that anger more constructively.  I am frustrated because some serious activism is what it is going to take and I don\'t have the time nor the energy nor the resources to get it done. I want to so badly though. God knows I am more than inclined to do so. Lord, I\'m so strapped for cash I can\'t even make it to the rally. The mainstream medial community AAP? needs to be sued for refusal to administer medical care to a very sick population, every state needs to legislate strong anti-thimerosal laws, stronger environmental laws, insurance companies need to cough up more comprehensive coverage, ABA  should be a right not a priviledge, and early diagnosis should be the law of the land. It is up to parents to advocate that there be a paradigm shift with educators and mainstream medicine.  The children  are being discriminated against and written off  because their strongest advocates and potential activists(we parents) are so saddled by the emotional and financial burden (SORRY MOMS AND DADS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN) that we are doing everything we can just  to to keep our families afloat.  I despise most doctors and never bought into the theory that they were just following orders.  Didn\'t they look into our children\'s innocent eyes and wonder just what could be in these vaccines when they stuck them? I know I did but trusted that the docs, pharmas would never do such a thing. What are they, mindless drones? I don\'t buy it for a second.  I am way, way past being a lady, being polite, being diplomatic. I will stop short of physical violence but will say what I have to say to whoever I have to say it to.  Anyone know how to get to the rally on the cheap BTW?

' <div class=\"postbody\">I was in the most extreme situation of this type that you can imagine.  I had to tell my son that I believed there was something \"wrong\" with his son!!!!  How I dreaded that day.  To begin with my heart was broken and then to think of breaking his was awful.    I am a terrible worrier so when I told my son (GS was about 16 or 17 months) he told me \"Oh, Mom, there is nothing wrong with him....go and find something else to worry about\".  He didn\'t really say it rudely, but it told me I was going to have to wait for a while.  I never mentioned it again but I had known for a couple of months when I finally told my son.  Nobody else in the world noticed anything but me...but, at 18 mos. he was dx\'d as being \"mildly\" on the spectrum.  That began his journey to recovery...a journey he is still on.    He is now six and talks up a storm and in most ways is indistinguishable from NT kids.  He is our pride and joy.....how we love him!  I suggest you keep the child in mind.  Of course, be as kind as you can, but remember the child is the important one in all of this.  If your niece gets angry....oh, well, she will either get over it, carry a grudge, or...most likely...thank you some day for caring enough to point out the truth.  If I can do it with my son....you CAN do it with your niece...I guarantee it <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclamation\" />  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /></div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I just wanted to point out something about giving our kids the \"cocktail of 20 or 30 vitamins and chelation\" being experimentation.  Yes we are BUT these are vitamins that we know won\'t HARM our kids.  We know what is in the vitamins we don\'t know what is in experimental drugs.  And all we have to see to be wary of experimental drugs are the recalls of so many drugs released in the last few years.  So while our experiments with the vitamins might fail and not help at least they won\'t hurt either, the same cannot be said for drugs.    Also I believe Doctor Neubrander is running a clinical trial with the MB-12 shots.</div>'

I think on the reward issue he will eventually understand the nuance, as his understanding is pretty good as long as we aren\'t talking about things too abstract. LMP- yes, we are having a lot of fun with those strawberries- the latest is making a smoothie together and then taking a picture of A with a \"strawberry moustache\".   On the flexibility- it\'s ironic how in ASD even good traits can be exacerbated and start looking weird. At least that\'s my conclusion. Many of my son\'s likes are reasonable, including the schedule thing (I hate schedules, but whatever- I can see why many people like/need them), the computer thing, the math thing etc,etc, but he pushes them to where they start to look too perseverative and no longer productive.  MCA- I don\'t think A is conversational enough to worry about topic sequencing right now <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" />. I\'m trying lower-level flexibility exercises, which can be as simple as substituting a word in a book/song with a different word (it took a while for DS to \"accept\" my \"mistake\" ), putting a yellow bear in the green bear cup (ds looks perplexed) or declaring one morning that today we will call him \"Balex\" instead of \"Alex\". Just an hour ago- I was putting him to bed and he chose a book to read, and I said that tonight we won\'t read the words, we are just going to talk about the pictures. He didn\'t like it and kept trying to revert back to the comfort of the written text (though he gets credit for going along with it). redisthecolor - too funny about your daughter raising her hand to speak !!

Never be alone in a meeting with people, because it can later become your word against theirs what happened and what was agreed to.    Also, I learned this from California\'s developmental disability system:  Never sign a paper that they say is \"to prove you were at the meeting\".  I did that once, and got an Individual Program Plan (IPP) back later that attached the paper I signed as proof that I\'d approved the IPP.  The IPP in fact included information that was totally false (physical medical diagnoses I\'d never been given, refusal to print diagnoses my doctors had faxed to them, work history I didn\'t even have, etc) and that I would never have signed off on.  It was claimed that I had \"told them all that\" (I hadn\'t) and that I had no business disagreeing since I\'d signed the paper.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I say that I do believe the vacs caused my sonâ€™s AUTISM because it was like he brain was erased within a 2 week period after receiving his 15mth shots including the mmr and another one that had the mercury in them. He is my only biological son &amp; so I have no other babies to compare him to except my stepson which I didnâ€™t meet till he was 4 &amp; is overly intelligent for his age. I do look back sometimes and try to think if there were things he did before what we call â€œD DAYâ€ (the day his mind was erased) that would have been considered weird or un-normal. But, I think that after AUTISM you will always question everything. (you do as a mother anyway)     My son crawled, walked, sat up &amp; talked on time. At 15mths old when â€œD DAYâ€ hit, he could say aprox. 30 words, was starting to name body parts, play games with you, was a happy baby &amp; was not overly sick. After â€œD DAYâ€ all that changed, he quit talking completely, started crying all the time for no reason, appeared to be deaf, started stemming &amp; lining things up, was sick all the time &amp; was almost OCD, just completely withdrew himself.     I do feel like I lost my son &amp; am still trying to get over holding a grudge against the AUTISM. I do want another child but want to adopt a 1 1/2yr old.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I can\'t say they\'re really doing any true ABA with him at school. They are all trained in ABA, especially our lead special ed teacher, but I think he just benefits by the shadowing and the pull outs for individual work. He just really benefits by that one on one teaching within the classroom setting.    It\'s either been the motivation of the other kids, or the mB12 - but probably a little of both that has helped him. The stimulation of the school environment helps.     There are also times when I\'m not sure he\'s getting it either, though  ..but he is a young 5 to be starting kindergarten as well. Many of these kids are turning 6, especially the boys. A lot of them get held back, then they seem like the superstar kindergarteners when they are more advanced than the young 5\'s.     But what happens is that the advanced kids get  a different form of instruction, and different activities to work on, while our not so fast kids get the more basic stuff. it\'s ok, but i\'m also wondering if they\'re too happy to have him proceed more slowly?     We always have the option to hold him back also for another year.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Forgot to add.  That last link is for \"Missing Pieces\" by Mark LeLand.  If you haven\'t watched that video, it is very powerful.  He wrote it for his manager\'s son.      The largest motivation behind this CD is the title track, â€œMissing Piecesâ€.  Lelandâ€™s manager and long time friend, Tim Calhoun, is the father of Nathaniel, the inspiration for this song.  Nathaniel, like 1.7 million other children, is autistic.  After listening to the stories of the challenges that families face in receiving treatment for their children diagnosed with autism and watching the pain his close friend was facing, Leland began to learn more and more about autism.  Together, Calhoun and Leland wrote â€œMissing Piecesâ€.  It is a touching song that takes a listener through the anguish of having a beautiful baby whose neurological sense become challenged in the first few years of life.  The autism community faces a constant struggle of learning about the causes of this terrible disease and the ever-changing ideas on effective treatment.           The philanthropic loyalty that Leland has towards helping this often unnoticed group of dedicated parents has been the basis of his decision to donate a portion of the proceeds from the sale of his Missing Pieces CD to organizations that can assist families in affording the treatment needed to help their autistic children succeed.  As the song â€œMissing Piecesâ€ is being played more and more, Leland is frequently asked to perform at autism benefits across the country.  Parents of autistic children who have heard his song are sharing his enthusiasm with other members of their community.  Together, Leland and his fans are spreading autism awareness across the nation and possibly, the world.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to 15 year old with Early Infantile Autism, Inattentive ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Anxiety Disorder</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to 15 year old with Early Infantile Autism, Inattentive ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Anxiety Disorder</div>'

It\'s amazing how much variance there is with our kids abilities.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ &quot;\'Sometimes,\' said Pooh, \'the smallest things take up the most room in your heart.\'&quot;</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ \'Sometimes,\' said Pooh, \'the smallest things take up the most room in your heart.\'</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">The difference is the focus on the behavior viewed as the goal in and of itself vs. the focus on the internal developmental or cognitive state.  If all you focus on is the behavior that is demonstrated with no interest in why, then it\'s accurate a Floortime program will drive you crazy.  But the premise of taking a developmental approach such as Floortime (it\'s not my favorite developmental approach, tbqh) is that if you assist them along the developmental path they missed due to the blinders of autism getting in the way, then a lot of the so-called \"behaviors\" will rectify themselves... and those that linger out of habit will be more willingly redirected, because you\'ve reduced whatever was creating the need for them in the first place.      But I also now think \"behavior\" is a very small part of autism.  A symptom rather than the entirety of it.      Personally?  I think the ideal program incorporates it all, adjusting day by day if not more often depending upon the needs of the child at whatever moment.  All approaches are valid for different children, and a combination is probably best for addressing the whole child.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">This invitation was originally posted on 7th December 2009 with the cut off date of 20th February 2010. I\'d like to now extend the date until the 20th March 2010. Those who are interested in this research after this date, can send an email and I will assess if I have time to collect and analyse the data in time for submission.  Dear Parent/ Guardian,   My name is Amy Dixon I am a 3rd year Psychology and Counselling BA (Hons) studying at the University of Derby, England. As part of my degree course, I am conducting a study into an area of my choice. I am particularly interested in the experiences of parents who have autistic children and how they cope with any difficulties, and am contacting you to invite you to participate in a study of the experience of bringing up a child with autism.   The research I am conducting is an interview using questions that invite you to discuss ways of coping relating to your childâ€™s developmental disorder. If you feel that there are particularly important areas that youâ€™d like to express during the interview then this is entirely appropriate as I am fascinated to hear about your experiences.   Previous research has explored many aspects of bringing up a child with autism. For example studies have identified how a childâ€™s delays or deficits in social development and specific problems in the parentâ€“child relationship can cause distress for mothers and fathers. Research into methods that can be used to help coping, such as the use of positive touch used in daily life provide insight into how the emotional barriers created by autism can be partially overcome.  Despite the difficulties and struggles parents may face, the influence of having an autistic child on family life is also portrayed as a positive life-changing experience and it is the breadth of details of the experience that this study will continue to extend.  This study will add further insight to the current research field, helping to provide further information for parents, researchers and organisational bodies. Research studies, such as this, are integral to the improvement of existing support services as they contribute further detail into the life experiences of children, families and parents experiences of living with autism.   Participating in this research will allow you to air all the personal views you hold regarding the difficulties, the experience of raising your child and all the coping methods you personally find useful. This is an opportunity to express all of the opinions you have formed and to explore the coping skills you have developed. Such self reflection may benefit you as your acknowledge all the areas you deal with, but also, when the works published, your experiences may help inform other parents. Your experiences may provide guidance or inspire other parents and prompt reflection onto their own ways of coping and dealing with any difficulties they face.   The research will be conducted via email and will involve participants responding to questions within a week of them being sent out, as this allows me time to transcribe data.   Participation is entirely voluntary and I would be very grateful to anyone who is willing to help me investigate this area further.   The interview data will be written up and analysed. Analysis will be conducted using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis which is a method that acknowledges the importance of the ways in which people explain their experiences.   Participants who take part will have their data altered so that no original names are used and thus no participants will be identifiable when the data is published after analysis. I, my supervisor and the marker of research are the only individuals who will see the raw data of the experiment, which is the data before the process of anonymising the data has occurred.   If participants wish to withdraw their data during or after the experiment they can do so using the unique alpha-numerical code created by combining:  Your motherâ€™s maiden name, Eg. Smith  and     the last three digits of your mobile telephone NUMBER, 567  So your code would be Smith567   This can later be used to identify their data, allowing for data to be correctly withdrawn if this is requested by the participants.  Participants who wish to withdraw their data after it has been collected in may do so up until the 20th March 2010 by contacting <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:a.dixon1@unimail.derby.ac.uk\">a.dixon1@unimail.derby.ac.uk</a><!-- e -->   Thank you for taking the time to read this and those who are interested can sign up via emailing <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:a.dixon1@unimail.derby.ac.uk\">a.dixon1@unimail.derby.ac.uk</a><!-- e -->.

I am impressed that you really went all the way and had the courage to hold your ground even though you knew that it was unlikely anyone would agree with your choices. I am also so happy that your consultant was open to trying it.     As for the red faced therapist - supervisor lady <img src=\"http://www.planetsmilies.com/smilies/mad/mad0002.gif\" alt=\"Image\" /> I really, really don\'t get this. Why, this fight to be right??? This is your child and they are supposed to be helping you and your child. You are saying that things are not working, that you are concerned for your son. I feel like if I was the therapist and I thought you were dead wrong, I still wouldn\'t be angry. I\'d be thinking this woman tried our way - she\'s concerned for her son and she wants to try something different - I don\'t think it will work but let\'s try because ultimately this woman needs to know she tried everything she could to see that her son is happy and feels safe and secure. WTF, why should that make her angry? Did she invent ABA that she has such a personal stake in it?    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Yesterday the woman who is also a supervisor but is on our case as a therapist stated she does not feel DS is using stim as any sort of outlet for anxiety.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Honestly, I think \"G\" would have been put in the thinking chair or something because we don\'t push, especially a NT child.  Then, I would have allowed your DS to sit in the chair and when \"G\" was out of time out, I would have made him ask your DS if he could sit with him.  If G obvioulsy wasn\'t going to do that, I would have had your DS get up and offer him a \"turn\" on the chair, but G needed a consequence.  I think you missed that because you wanted the social lesson but your ds would have learned from that too, I believe.  I think he could have learned a little respect from that.    I am no expert obviously and am not telling you YOU did anything wrong.  That\'s just my take when reading it.  I wasn\'t there and don\'t know what I would have truely \"done\".  Just another perspective.  If my NT 3yr. old ds pushed a little boy out of the chair that was offering to share wiht him, he\'d go to time out.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Lisa</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Lisa</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thanks for the movie review...I\'ll have to wait for the DVD.

Then when she finally gets here, (4 hours late, somehow 1pm turned into 5pm!!!) she has the nerve to hand me some money and says, \"Can you pick up something for the kids while you\'re out, I don\'t want to get them the wrong thing?\"   So my shopping expedition turned into one for her   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x\" title=\"Mad\" />     Since she was so late, I only had about about 2 hours and at  1 store it took me that long to stand in line practically.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi LM- We\'ve done it about 2 months.  He is just nearing his 20th dive.  We haven\'t been very aggressive with it...just about 3 hour long sessions a week.  It\'s mHBOT.  But I definitely notice the articulation has drastically improved.  Again, I can\'t confirm it\'s the HBOT but it correlates with when we are doing it.  Also the LONG sentences have just materialized in the past month.  I\'ve also seen some negatives but not sure what that\'s from.  Everyone is saying allergy season is bad so I\'m getting a lot of \"no\'s\" lately from him and sometimes he is nasty which is unlike him.  It\'s so tricky to figure out what is helping (or not).  I\'m really not doing that much in the way of biomed so mHBOT was the really \'big\' thing we are doing.  (also doing mb12 for like 4 1/2 months...also the basic supplementation).  I just got LL and wanted to do that but AJ\'s pH is pretty decent.  I\'ve only been doing one drop in the a.m.  That was very recent though (I\'d say just last week).  The longer sentences and stuff started before that.  Definitely more spontaneous language has been noted.  Not too much in the way of pretend play which is what I was hoping to get from mHBOT ...  Everyone seems to be doing the hard chamber now...maybe that gives more of an effect?</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">toddlers are cute in the things they say not knowing the meaning and autistic kids are no different. when i was about 2 my mom said i saw an old man in the store and quite loudly announced, he is really old mom he\'s going to die isnt he. (yes i talked in full sentences at 1 year old i guess genetics showed early there i love to talk.) so absolutly embarassed beyond belief she had to have the appropriate vs. inappropriate talk with me though i didnt get it at 2, who would? i had a few more moments so im told.   i kinda wish my son would blurt something like this out as then i would have a better understanding of what he is thinking about. right now only talks to get needs met and just started showing intrest in showing things and commenting on things in books but only one word. its a start and i look forward to embarassing moments to come. my other son doesnt understand how to say i like something more than something or someone else and often will out right tell people i like so and so not you when he really means ive taken a new intrest in this person and i like them too in a different way than you and i like you in such and such way. but it comes across as rude or mean or insensitive, hard to keep freinds as they then think he no longer likes them. so black and white in his thinking or right and wrong no in betweens allowed either. he also likes to tease on which is your favorite sports teams and purposely say he likes an opposing team all to get your reaction even though he may like the same team too. we call him a ship jumper changing coats so often but i love his thinking pattern b/c in todays teachings there is no absolute truth, things can be manipulated to have the outcome be what you want it to be or in your view point so in this way he is old fashioned!!! there is absolute truth its either this way or that not in the middle or sorta, though recently he has added to his phrases i kinda like your team etc. better awareness that it may hurt feelings to be so blunt. we are really having trouble with the hidden social meanings of things like girls bug you b/c they like you, how could that possibly make sense? so much to go through, all in good time i say.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Lisalynn  keeping hope and faith through it all.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Lisalynn  keeping hope and faith through it all.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Well, this forum is going to give you a biased sample of answers because (no offense to anyone here) most of the members here are either parents of autistic children or autistic themselves, thus no parent is going to risk bashing his/her child, and many autistic people are asking the exact same question you are.    It has been a personal mission of mine for quite some time to uncover as much of this mystery as possible. I have been carefully studying what it is about me that seems to turn many people away and from what I can tell, there seem to be about four very complex issues at play. Here is what I have uncovered so far.    a) Perceived rudeness/insensitivity: NTs tend to be vain and sensitive as a whole, and thus their language reflects it, resulting in euphemisms and understood meanings that we (autistics) are often blind to. We tend to speak very matter-of-factly, not intending any ill will, but not following the euphemism game ether. Thus NTs will read into our words what they would expect to read into another NT\'s words, causing a misunderstanding. They consider us callous, uncaring, or snotty at first glance, and often a glance is all we get.    b) Perceived odd or inappropriate behavior: Some of the body language we exhibit reflects our lack of connectivity with the outside world, from staring to unusual pastimes to odd forms of self stimulation. People in general tend to be either uncomfortable or curious with what they do not understand. So when they encounter it, they will immediately try to either avoid it or explain it. Either way can spell trouble, because when someone does not understand the nature of autism, they do not attribute it to our behavior. However, they need an explanation to put their mind to rest, so they go on what they do know as a means of fabricating an explanation. As a result, an autistic person can quickly get negative reputations that he or she neither deserves, nor is even aware of.    c) Perceived inflexibility: Autistic people, even those who are able to function in society, need time to plan things in their head. I, for example, have a massive mental database of \"if-then\" scenarios regarding not only words, but physical actions as well. Thus I work better if I can anticipate the situation and have a dozen or so of these scenarios plotted out ahead of time, affording me the 30-to-60-second buffer zone I need without making it visible to the people who I\'m talking to. The only problem with that is that NTs tend to be spontaneous and change plans at the drop of a hat. When this happens, my \"buffer zone\" becomes visible to others because I have to reprogram myself to follow a different sequence of \"if-thens.\" Even if it only takes 10 seconds or less, the short hesitation and confusion appears as a non-compliance, so when I\'m finally ready and say \"okay\" it is perceived as sarcasm (going back to the euphemism issue in part A). Even though I truly mean I\'m OK with the plan now, my body language has told them that I\'m actually upset even though I am saying it\'s OK, which in fact is a regular deceptive practice among NTs, hence the convincing nature of the body language. This causes people who are not recognized as autistic to be perceived as rigid, inflexible, difficult to get along with, and sometimes, even combative. As for those who are recognized as autistic, it results in the myth that autistic people are intolerant of change and can\'t deviate from their routine. In actuality they can deal with change, they simply need the proper preparation time in order to make the transition smoothly.    d) Perceived lack of intelligence/lack of functionality: A common misconception about autistic people is that they are, by definition, retarded or at best, below average intelligence. While this is, of course, is not necessarily the case, it\'s not been easy to bust the myth (OK I\'m calling MythBusters now!  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /> ). Thus when it becomes known that a person has autism or that they are a little different or eccentric, people tend to assume that the person is incapable of doing random things. This can be because they do not think the person is smart enough, or it can be, as a result of part C, they do not think the person is willing. And people, in general, often do not desire what they can\'t gain benefit from, so lack of functionality, as well as insensitivity, inappropriate behavior, and inflexibility, becomes an undesirable trait -- even if it is falsely judged.    These four categories go much, much deeper than what I have summarised here, but I didn\'t want to write a novel right here and now.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" />  (And I didn\'t even mention the effects of being \"out of the clique\" as a result of placing value in different areas, which is especially demeaning in younger people.) Nonetheless, these are the main players, best I can figure so far, but unfortunately each one is so complex and multifaceted that you could go on all day about any one of them.    Hopefully, though, these summaries will be enough to give you a general idea of where the roots of the problem lie. And as David mentined, it seems for the most part that NTs, or rather the society they have created, is solely what makes autism a \"disorder.\" Thus I\'m afraid that the treatment may have to come not just from trying to make autistics more like NTs, but also from better educating NTs on what exactly it is that they are seeing, and how to better read it.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ ~Nick    If it wasn\'t for sexual harassment in the workplace....

Her real treatment hasn\'t even begun yet , but we are very confident she will respond well . We so far have told only the people closest to us , and plan on keeping it this way. We are not planning on keeping it a secret , but at the same time we are not broadcasting it. I may be wrong but my instincts tell me it is on a need to know basis.  I don,t think as parents we should be focusing on the label , instead focus on treatment.     What if in the next 2 years she doesn\'t show any ASD symptoms , I do not what her to be labeled by ignorant society. I know we have our dx, but i am trying not to focus on the label. I try not to think of her as autistic . To me she is just a pretty little girl that  needs more time to learn things . I think with the proper treatment even this will change.     Good luck to you and i know things will only get better for us all.</div>'

Then, he runs and hides when I yell at him........    And don\'t get me started on MIL\'s  I\'m SURE I have EVERYONE on this board beat when it comes to this subject.   My last conversation with mine, she hung up on me and then called back to tell my husband she was going to call the police on me and have me arrested for \"harassment.\"    (I called to make sure she was ok since I know one of her neighbors and they called and told me an ambulance had been down by her house that morning.  They weren\'t sure if it was her house or not but close so I called.........won\'t do that again.)      She NEVER visits Luke and Jessica so my mom is they\'re only grandparent. But she does beg my husband for pictures and I\'m thinking, why bother to ask when you\'re not a part of their life?

' <div class=\"postbody\">re: stims    Ds used to be a stim-machine around the ages of 3-4, now I think perseverations (galore) better describe him- i.e. not outward stims (physical), but certain repetitive activities (like imitating, humming, singing etc) have replaced them (maybe vocal stims?).  I think he needs the stims. I am no longer in the phase where I wanted to suppress each one of them. For whatever reason his nervous system needs this and I\'m OK with that. I am trying to teach him when/where it is inappropriate to stim and to maybe \"save\" it for the privacy of his own room. Maybe that\'s as unreasonable an expectation as suppressing the stims altogether, I don\'t know, but I think it\'s worth a shot since he is still young and doesn\'t seem to be made uncomfortable by not stimming .   When my son checks out, he doesn\'t seem to register much of what is being said to him, his stimming doesn\'t seem a way of better perceiving his environment, rather a means of avoiding it. Of course, I am not generalizing anything, that\'s just my observation about him in particular.   On a much smaller scale- I am a major hair-twirler (which is why I can\'t cut my hair short, I would miss it too much). Especially when I\'m stressed, or tired, or alone etc- but even if I felt like it , I would never   do that in a meeting for example. I don\'t want to teach ds not to stim, but to understand that at times this can be inappropriate (like in class when everyone else is working), or bothersome (like when his little sister is sleeping), or interfering with other things (like when we are doing homework). So he can ask for a stim break - he has that option (and never uses it) or just save it for later.   It also dawned on me that sometimes ds uses his stims as a means of controlling the interaction, steering it to something he is having mastership of, avoiding tasks etc. If I think that\'s the case I just completely ignore them, and he usually stops.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Ok, first, Mom to Matthew.... I LOVE the answer your son came up with.  I would want to go home too.    Jeffrey\'s mom....My daughter did not do well on the IQ test in kindergarten.  Her score was 69 \"with caution\" which is written on her IEP.  The reason being, she answered some questions above what she should have known, but missed answers she SHOULD have known.  That score affected me for about a week, but when I explained to the school psychiatrist that my daughter had a \"performance deficit\", she really, truly understood what that meant, therefore \"with caution\" was added because the test truly couldn\'t measure her intelligence.    I personally think IQ tests suck!  (no bitterness, huh?) How would some of the \"book smart\" people perform on a social IQ test, if there was one?      We need all types of people in this world from the book smart, to the social smart, to the athletic smart, and the list goes on and on.      DO NOT let this score get to you.  He is still the same little boy he was before the test, and you KNOW how far he has come!  And think about it....as adults, we are not on the same level either.  We all have our special gifts to this world, and a high or low score IQ test means nothing in the end.      I\'m sure today he will do something to make your heart smile and remind you that you are ok.    I hope I helped you.  Dee\'s mom</div>'

We also discouraged it since it interfered with his life in many ways (hard to learn and function properly when he\'s hypnotized by a fan). It seemed the more he watched a fan, the more he was \"stuck\" on them, almost like an addiction. We left fans off whenever possible, and tried to always have something on hand that we knew he had a strong interest in (a little toy etc) to divert his attention in case we ended up in a place with a fan. He did cycle through other obsessions, but we tried to direct him to things that were more socially appropriate and less disrupritive to learning and life.  As for the fear, is it from the noise or from the sight of the fan? If it\'s just the idea of the fan, and the noise doesn\'t bother him, perhaps find a little toy fan and introduce it to him in increasing increments of time in a playful manner, or something along these lines to show him that fans won\'t hurt him. Try to make fans \"funny\" or non-threatening in some playful manner - show him (from a distance) how the wind makes things fly across the room, or tie a streamer to a box fan....etc. (just some brainstorming, I hope I\'m making sense  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />  )   I hope this helps!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ mibrielle</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ mibrielle</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">having experience in both aba and vb or as some say vba what you are talking about is clearly the difference between the two. in vb you(the aide or parent if you implement sameness at home) are the giver and the positive person in the childs life who is rewarding their every attempt to comply/communicate etc. whatever the goal is. in aba you are the taker awayer(i know not a real word) their model; if you dont do something you wont get your reward. laws of natural behaviors are easy... you want to do things when you are rewarded for them and you want to do things if you know you are going to be rewaded but FIRST the trust has to be there that you know the giver is going to reward. my behaviorist always tells people... you wouldnt work without getting a paycheck(unless you volunteer and that is by choice) and also you wouldnt work and then wait 3 months to get paid. asd children are smart and figure out this system pretty quickly. my child has not tried to task avoid for over two years, since converting and understanding this way, not saying he likes everything he has to do but he will do the task. another big difference is his mind is not so upset about trying to get out of it he is actually concentrating on the task not thinking how quickly he can do it to get it over with, or even more concerning to a parent is he is no longer thinking how long will they force/restrain me to sit here and do this skill regardless of circumstance ie. your example of having to to the bathroom, needing a sensory break, any other situation . he had gone through many programs/tasks in his prior aba with them checking off acheived and in reality he was only doing it not LEARNING it. we had to back track and redo almost everything from his aba programs. i was so naive when we moved cities i didnt even know their was a difference in styles and luckily when we moved back we were able to hook up with our original vb provider. hence we have a happier, more social(b/c this aide who is spending 40 or so hours a week is also molding your childs feelings about relating to people by example and their actions, another scary thought.) loving school and loving therapy child. and in the end isnt this what we want??? along with the learning and becoming the most they can be!!! i should have went on mothers instincts when the first day we had aba, wasnt even therapy just a get to know us, the aide and provider gave him a toy and not even two minutes later without warning took it away. well i asked why did you do that and they said to push him and test him. he of course any 3 yr old would be, was upset. just didnt make sense to me to do that and the year continued on that note i just wasnt educated enough to know better and luckily we relocated back to our original city and vb programming. im not knocking aba just MY experience with it. also it does not mesh with my family values and style idont beleive in eat everything on your plate or no dessert, clean your room or you lose tv privledges etc. etc. all examples of being a taker awayer. so just in this way it was not a fit for us and im sure others think aba is great and works for their kids though it also probably depends a lot on personality too;layed back passive compared to youngest sibling feisty and strong willed. just my 2 cents and agreement with the poision tree/fruit theory.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Lisalynn  keeping hope and faith through it all.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Lisalynn  keeping hope and faith through it all.</div>'

I think some professionals think they can give you a plan and you will go away and use it forever unchanged. We have to meet at least once a month with our behavior expert to change and update the plan.

Consistency is the hardest thing, since her dad and I have different styles and tend to interpret a situation differently! We try to figure out ahead of time how we will react to all possible scenarios so we\'re consistent.  Another problem we\'ve encountered is that the person making up the plan really needs to analyze the function of each behavior so that the plan doesn\'t inadvertently reinforce the behavior.

' <div class=\"postbody\">We went through this as well.  My son would literally kick off his shoes (yes they\'d go airborne) as soon as we walked into the school building.  We would put them back on and the aid constantly put them back on, eventually we just put him in slipper socks upon arrival at school.  Slippers work well too.  It is just a sensory thing, seeking input on the soles and the toes.  The feet take in input very much the same way that our hands do, so for our tactile kids feet crave touch just like their little hands do.      Some sensory activities will help meet that need.      Walk barefoot through shoe boxes set up with different textures.... cotton, corn kernnels, a big lined with sandpaper, bubble wrap.... get creative.    Foot massages  Foot spas (I got mine for $18 at Walmart, he LOVES it)  Firm pressure with a soapy rag on the top and bottom of foot  Joint compressions  Shoes weights  Ankle weights  Running  Jumping    Invest in comfy socks, and socks of different textures (like those fuzzy ones).</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Dana</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Dana</div>'

How is Sonrise different from, say, RDI?  They sound very similar at a glance, no?     <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">the 1:1 aspect of child and parent or therapist in a room with no distractions and no pressures allows you to engage fully, with full attention. so for example, potty training - the potty is in the room, child has to pee, its just you, child, potty and diaper and a few reinforcers. </div>  Again, I know virtually nothing of sonrise, but this method for potty training is one that was discussed in a workshop I attended recently through our local CARD, which is largely behavioral.  It would be considered the \"intensive\" approach, which <em>sounds </em>really ugly of course, but the basic plan as I understood it would be very similar, and keeping the child engaged during this time would be of the utmost importance.   Are there other specifics you can share that would make it more distinctly sonrise?  I do realize that many \"brand name\" therapies share things in common and overlap, perhaps this is just one of those instances?</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I was talking to the vice principal of my son\'s private school about homeschooling him.  She is one of S.\'s biggest fans, she suggested we think about a part time option with the school.  Basically, we homeschool and of the curriculum list under say english or music, we list the school\'s name as the place where he will recieve his instruction.  The school has a new and progressive prinicipal and they are restructuring how they do things.  I\'ve found a few private schools around here willing to allow people to do this, at a price of course.  His current private school suggested we try one or two class for first grade, then part time for second and then full time for the next thee years.  We are going to see how it goes.  The vice principal, Sister Joseph, is retiring after 35 years of teaching.  She also pointed out to me that the problem isn\'t always the kid.  She also told me if S.\'s anxiety is only happening at school or more specifically in the class room, that we need to consider what else is contributing to the problem, meaning how his teacher is dealing with his anxiety and his giagantic crush on the teacher\'s aide.  The principal also alluded to the same problem.  Since, S. handle a belt test for his Tae Kwon Do test in room with 30 other kids, 6 instructors and a hundred spectators without any anxiety and tons of focus,  I\'m thinking they may be right.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Rebekah -- I think Mary hit on a great point: \"a teacher who cares and wants to learn is like finding gold!\"     Based on the fact that you are here looking for answers, you\'re already way ahead of many.  I have not yet had the pleasure of dealing with teachers specific to my son\'s needs (he\'s only 2), but over the years of dealing with my daughter\'s teachers (junior in high school now), I have to agree with Mary.  Ultimately, I think the same things that go into making  great \"regular ed\" teachers also apply to special ed teachers -- but perhaps with greater need and potentially making a greater difference.  Showing a genuine interest in our children and valuing our input will go a long way toward building relationships and ultimately helping the children... not to mention that it will probably help you to love your job and maintain your motivation.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /></div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">I was just wondering to see if any one had a child who sailed through the first six months and got to \"speaking\" and numbers and letters in that time</div>  Well, technically, mine did at the end of 6 months speak unprompted in 1-2 words (mostly requests and labels) and had letters/numbers nailed (due to Sesame Street and his hyperlexic tendencies, not because anyone was teaching those). That didn\'t make him less PDD, but it certainly gave him more skills and made our (and his) life a little easier. This has been an ongoing problem of mine (there was an interesting thread about it a while ago, but I don\'t remember how it started)- I see more skills much faster than I see less autism (does this make sense?). I would say he was off to a good start, and has made progress, but he is still PDD. My point is that the first six months may not necessarily be indicative of later progress or functioning. Don\'t know if those who did the ABA studies looked at prognostic information from that end.  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">We have been told by our ABA specialists that our boy is not excelling at his program because we dont have enough therapists or time put into it</div>  At 15-20 hours a week? I don\'t buy it.  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">our ABA people dont want us around during therapy time which is really galling!   I mean, its my child and its my house!! I need to see what they are doing so i can learn to do it myself when they are not here. </div>    It\'s ridiculous for them not to share their methods with you, since any good ABA program has such heavy parental involvment. However, after hearing more about them it makes me wonder if they really have a lot to teach you.    The one thing that made the most difference for my son in the early learner stage, was teaching him to request. This is something that was really stressed by our consultant (it\'s very important in VB), and it went over well with my son who realized that he had to produce \"something\" in order to get what he wants. Sabotaging his environment was necessary at the time, things were out of his reach, in clear plastic bins. He couldn\'t get them unless he came to me and asked for them. At this point , a good consultant should help suggest what exactly you can expect from your child based on his current level. If you ask too much (like a whole word) and he isn\'t yet talking, that will just frustrate him. Sometimes it is easier to start with sign (because it can be prompted). If the child can vocally imitate, then a syllable (sp?) is enough (this is what we did at first), or PECS. Just so they get the idea of communication= a good thing. You don\'t even have to worry about reinforcing because it\'s already built into what they are requesting.     One thing that stuck with me, is reading somewhere (in Gutstein\'s book I think) that children (ANY children) are always capable of just a little more than they are currently doing. It was a Russian psychologist who said that, I don\'t remember his name (starts with a V). It sounds simplistic, but it\'s really brilliant- we just have to know how to scaffold things really carefully for them. With PDD kids, I imagine they just need tons more scaffolding than typical kids - which is what good ABA is supposed to do, break down a skill until it can\'t be broken down any further, right?    Also- do you have the Bumblebee videos? They are great for early language and many ASD kids love them.   Best of luck- a break always sounds good, if not for them, at least for us <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />  Alex\'s mom</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Lee\'s Summit families start autism support group     Group bonds together in time of funding shortfall for special education     By Chase Jordan  Tribune Staff        Sherri Tucker and her family moved to Lee\'s Summit because she believed her son would receive the best education here.     Jacob was diagnosed with autism 11 years ago.  He is now 14 years old.     \"I chose where we moved in Kansas City, solely on my son.  I didn\'t care about location.  I wanted to live where Jacob had the best opportunity,\" Tucker said.  \"We moved here when he was in kindergarten.\"     The family is not pleased with the R-7 School District.     \"We can be living in Raytown or Independence and pay less tax and pay less for the water bill and still not get any worse of an education,\" Tucker said.     In November 1006, Tucker and Debra Shaumeyer created the Lee\'s Summit Autism Support Group.  Shaumeyer is the mother of a 5-year-old autistic son.     \"What we want to do is get the school district to work with us to give the best education they can.  In the sate of Missouri that\'s not an easy thing to do,\" Tucker said.  \"Most of the time we talk about what goes on in the school district.\"     Tucker described Individualized Education Plan meetings, which are attended by seven to 15 school officials.     \"So you sit there and these people tell you that your child is never going to be normal, which is a very hard thing to handle,\" Tucker said.  \"You assume that these people are giving you all the right information and you believe them and you sign on the dotted line. What you never find out is that those people are never going to give you what you need until you\'re smart enough to know what you need and you fight for it.\"     Tucker said Missouri is 48th in the country for special education funding.     \"In the state of Missouri, when your kid gets diagnosed with autism, the doctor ways go forth, you\'re done, and you\'re on your own,\" she said. \"We\'re working on legislative issues and trying to work with the school district.\"     Senator Matt Bartle, of Lee\'s Summit, said Missourians are not interested in raising taxes.  He said Missourians rejected the last seven ballot proposals to raise taxes.  <span style=\"color: blue\">(I\'ve read that there is a surplus.  This issue has nothing to do with raising taxes)</span>     \"We\'re ranked 48 or 49 in a lot of things,\" Bartle said.  \"We\'re a low spending state because we\'re a low taxing state.\"  <span style=\"color: blue\">(I guess its ok to be 48th if you are consistent across the board.)</span>     Bartle said autism is a problem that Missouri is going to have to deal with.  <span style=\"color: blue\">(Sorry to be a burden)</span>     \"Autism is a growing problem in Missouri and in the United States, and it\'s putting a strain on social services and the school system,\" he said.  \"We have to figure out what\'s causing autism.  It\'s a major cost drainer in Medicaid and the education budget.\"  <span style=\"color: blue\">(Good luck with that.  We\'d like to know what is causing it, too.  However, we are sorry that we are a major drainer on your budget.)</span>     According to the Lee\'s Summit group, there are more than 210 students diagnosed with autism in the district.  They believe that the teachers in the district should be trained in autism.     \"A lot of these kids with autism are in special education, so their teacher would be trained in autism,\" Tucker said.  \"But my son is not in special ed, he\'s in regular ed.  So he has seven teachers everyday that don\'t have a clue and they\'re going to educate my son.\"     Tucker said there have been times when her son became sick or had \"meltdowns\" because of the different expectations of teachers.     Jerry Keimig, R-7 director of special services, said that it is not possible to train every teacher in the district.     \"We provide the most comprehensive autism training than any other school district that I\'m aware of,\" Keimig said.  \"It\'s not feasible to train every teacher for every disorder.  There are 50 to 60 different medical or emotional diagnoses.\"  <span style=\"color: blue\">(I\'m pretty sure that the other 49 to 59 don\'t affect 1 in 94 boys.  The district\'s program only trains special education teachers.  Not paras or regular ed teachers.  They also let folks from other districts come in and they charge a fee for that.  We have asked that they video tape the workshop and make it available to regular ed teachers.  We have asked that they train one teacher at each grade level and have her teach our kids.  They could afford an administrative building that was millions of dollars, but they can\'t afford to help our kids.)</span>     The district hosted a four-day workshop in June.     \"We try to make autism a priority.  I don\'t know any other disability that we do four-day workshops on,\" Keimig said.     Stacey Martin, autism specialist, said about 75 people participated in the workshop. <span style=\"color: blue\">(I would say that at least half of those were not employees of the district.  Five or six were members of our group)</span>     \"We try to target those teachers who have not had training before.  We do our very best to make sure they have the training they need to meet the needs of students,\" Martin said.  \"We are always looking for new things to learn about autism. We\'re always eager to help these kids.\"     Superintendent Dr. David McGehee said it would be difficult to make every teacher an expert, but believes they should have some basic knowledge of autism if they are teaching a diagnosed child.  <span style=\"color: blue\">(They do not do this.  I\'m not asking for them to be an expert.  But, they are ought to know the basics and this district refuses to do that.)</span>     \"There are opportunities for the teachers to be trained,\" McGehee said.  \"You can\'t deal with all students the same because they have different needs.  It\'s a challenge in today\'s education system.\"  <span style=\"color: blue\">(This is simply not true, unless the teachers train on their own time.  Dr. McGehee also said that \" Although repeatedly recognized for our students\' outstanding scores on the Missouri Assessment Program tests, our district has still been placed in the \"District Improvement Level 1\" category based on the scores of a very small number of students in two sub-groups. These students were in the sub-groups of special-education students and \"English language learners\" (students who do not speak English as their first language). Although we do single out these two sub-groups as part of this explanation, I want to make it clear that we are proud of these students and their efforts and believe that they did their best on the state-wide tests, demonstrating improvement in a comparison of 2006 and 2007 test scores. The students in both categories were required to meet the same high standard as regular-education students with no modification of the MAP communication arts tests that would take the students\' disabilities and special language challenges into account. The scores of students in these two sub-groups are the sole reason our district was designated in this category. A misleading aspect of this legislation is that only districts with a large enough sub-group population can be identified, thus holding harmless smaller districts with similar or lower levels of achievement.\")</span>    McGehee said the support group does a good job dealing with autism.    \"I appreciate Mrs. Tucker\'s approach in the group.  I don\'t look at them as antagonist or anything because we need to find a common ground,\" McGehee said.  \"Sometimes people perceive it as a fight.  I perceive it as continuing dialog.\"  (<span style=\"color: blue\">When your child\'s future is at stake, continuing dialog isn\'t enough. If he doesn\'t see us as antagonist, why did he bring it up?)</span>    Tucker said she wants to work with the school district to improve in this area.    \"I don\'t want to be negative, but I want to let people know there\'re other people with the same issues,\" Tucker said.  \"I want people to know that we need to progress in this area.\"</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to 15 year old with Early Infantile Autism, Inattentive ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Anxiety Disorder</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to 15 year old with Early Infantile Autism, Inattentive ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Anxiety Disorder</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Jujomom,    Not much time to post, but I wanted to pass along the names of a couple of my favourite books:  For a good ABA read, check out \"Let Me Hear Your Voice\" by Catherine Maurice and \"Overcoming Autism\" by Lynnn Koegel and Claire Lazebnik.  \"Facing Autism\" by Lynn Hamilton is good too.  It gives a great overview of all the treatment options including ABA and biomedical.  Incidentally, my son was three years at diagnosis and he did not start ABA until he was three years and eight months.  He is certainly not \"indistinguishable\", but he has made much progress.  It is wonderful that your son is so young and that he already has some words in place.  I bet he moves really quickly when you get things going.  My doctor\'s son was also not diagnosed until age three (and she is a pediatrician) so give yourself a pat on the back for getting the early diagnosis.  Regarding ABA providers, my best advice is to trust your instincts.  Look at the qualifications of course, but go with your gut feelings.  My son was in a government run ABA program (supervised by a PHD psychologist) and it was a nightmare.  I could feel that it was a bad fit from the first day.   I ended up removing him from the program and hiring a lady who had almost no credentials, but she just seemed to have better instincts when it came to addressing his individual strengths and deficits.   Educate yourself quickly - you will be in a much better position to judge who is effective and who is not.        Brandon\'s mom - it certainly sounds like Aspergers to me.  I hope you can get an appropriate evaluation completed soon.  I know that a lot of Asperger kids slip through the cracks when they are young.  The ones that are identified early are usually the ones with a ton of behaviours.  My co-workers grandson was just diagnosed in fifth grade.  Incidentally, he has always identified cars by their make and model as well (i.e. there is a red chevrolet or there is a blue ford).  When my son was assessed for autism, the psychologist actually asked if he ever talked about cars this way.  It was a question on the assessment.  I remember thinking \"what a strange thing to ask\".  Now I know better.    Best of luck to you    Just a mom</div>'

I\'ll let you know how the transitioning goes over the next year or so because Gracie should be transitioning over to regular school.    A lot of different factors to consider though, as you probably already know.  A change in towns can sometimes make a big difference.  You can even find out about new programs.   I dunno, I guess I just don\'t feel completely comfortable trying to give advice about districts down here when all I know is my situation and my individual district.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #400080\">Bill</span> <span style=\"color: #FF8000\">Aly 16;Dillan 14;Jason 11 Liv 8 ASD Grace 6 PDD</span> <span style=\"color: #FF0000\">and Linda</span></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Bill</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">When my NT son was three, I think we actually threw cheerios in the toilet to have him aim at them.  He thought that was fun.  Then with my ASD daughter, I just put her in underwear and washed a lot.  I would put her in front of the TV on the potty chair and IF she went, I made a big deal.  Eventually she got the pee pee thing, but the poops took a lot longer.  I read a book on teaching your special needs child how to go, and one thing that really helped..... I would put her in the bathroom by herself at a time when she usually had to go, then leave her alone and watch thru the keyhole.  I kept telling her what a good job she was doing just sitting there.  That was the key.  Just to sit still long enough to be in there.  Anyway, just kept praising her and kept her in their at 15 min. intervals.  Even if she didn\'t go, I praised her, but eventually she went after a few days of it.  She always held her poop in, so it was tough for a long time.  At about kindergarten, it got better, but I would have to catch her in the act and then tell her to go to the bathroom.    In first grade she finally got it.  So see, for us it took awhile and I didn\'t think we\'d ever get there, but we did.  Good luck!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">For observing: Is the layout of the room such that it would be possible to observe without being seen? If not, maybe use a video monitor (even like a baby monitor) to observe without your child being able to see you. Maybe they\'d keep it set up, so you could drop in to check up from time to time. Other parents might like this as well (though the teachers might not). Some schools have full time online cameras for parents, so it\'s not that far out in left field for them to do.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ mibrielle</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ mibrielle</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">You\'re welcome, Gabesmom.  Glad your trip went well.    As you probably already know, RDI is much more than redirecting problem behaviors.  The more our kids (or anyone, for that matter) can find comfort and security in trusted people, the less they need ritual behaviors and things.  The more you can do to help your child know how to \"read\" comfort and security in you (or any trusted adult,) the less need he has for rituals.       I truly believe that ASD kids can learn perfectly well how to read people, they just need to be taken through all of the steps.  In my own experience, I see that this process is bringing more joy and peace to my own child.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Fred, 7, NT  Barney, 5, autism</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Fred, 7, NT  Barney, 5, autism</div>'

I think you are proving to us that RDI works and that Gutstein is correct- his method can remediate autism (or at least parts of it).

' <div class=\"postbody\">I don\'t think that anyone on this forum means to degrade anyone for not using biomedical treatments.  All of us have different treatments that we use.  Most of us do use a combination.  David Kirby is a hero to some of us (including myself) along with all the DAN! doctors and researchers.  I\'m sorry if it seems that we constantly talk about biomedical treatments but for some of us this is what works for our children.  My child IS recovering and I believe it is because of heavy metals being pulled out of his system.  I don\'t feel that promoting David Kirby\'s book is any type of a publicity stunt.  To me and many others it is a way of getting people to simply ask more questions about why autism is skyrocketing.  A lot of spelling errors on this forum are simply due to typing errors.  I myself tend to have run on sentences and don\'t correct them because I just don\'t have the time.  I hope that we all can start working together and please don\'t feel discouraged that there are so many biomed. posts.

' <div class=\"postbody\">ETA: Just saw where you said that your DS doesn\'t really stim - just ignore that first paragraph if it doesn\'t apply.  Figured I\'d leave it in just in case.  I second the vote to join in with some of his stims.  It really can be very beneficial for him, and if that\'s what he enjoys, then you are playing with him.  I got very caught up for a long time with the idea that DS\'s play had to look NT in order to be fun and beneficial.  Definitely not true.  My DS loves it when we join in with what makes him happy, and doing that has really helped draw him out of himself.  The diet and biomed made him aware of the world around him, but he had no idea what to do about it.  We had to meet him on his level to get him playing with us, and it didn\'t take long for him to get back to a point where he\'d rather play with us than without us.  Even now, we still do a lot of this.  I must have hundreds of scenes from DS\'s favorite shows committed to memory so that I can script along with him.  His first attempts at conversation were actually us scripting scenes from Dragon Tales!  Other things that have been good for us - lots of physical play.  This doesn\'t always mean outdoor play.  We live in an area that has poor air quality warnings fairly often during the summer, so it keeps us indoors a lot.  Some of the things that we do are simple tickle fights (he\'s actually starting to tickle me!), red light/green light (or stop/go), imitating animals (crawling, slithering, hopping, barking, meowing, etc. This helps pretend play too), and building forts.  Sensory play is great, and you can easily make it interactive by taking turns, working together, etc.  DS loves his rice and beans pit, which is just a plastic storage container full of dry rice and beans.  He\'s also very into gluten-free play doh, bubbles, feathers, and rolling around on his bean bag.  We\'ve even &quot;painted&quot; the walls of the hallway with shaving cream - the only way I could get him to touch it!  We\'re lucky enough to have a sensory room now too, but before we had to get much more creative.  A modified follow the leader has also been great for us.  DS, DH, and I stand in a circle and take turns telling each other what to do.  It\'s just simple things like touch your head/ears/nose, hop on one foot, run in place, etc.  At first, it was just DH and I giving directions; early on, one of us often had to physically guide DS through the motions.  Now, DS will actually ask to play it and loves to give commands; he gets a kick out of wearing DH and I out with the running in place.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to one 4-yr-old boy, dx w/Asperger\'s</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to one 4-yr-old boy, dx w/Asperger\'s</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">From what I understand, they give the PDD dx when the child shows some good social behaviors. If the child does is not attached to anyone, including parents, autism is the dx. If child shows attatchment to someone (most likely a parent) it\'s called PDD.     I think the PDD term is so unfortunate, because it is very misleading in that it seems that the child isn\'t \"that autistic\". I\'ve seen plenty of children with a PDD dx who are doing good, and plenty who are very low functioning and very autistic. In my opinion, PDD and autism is the same thing, and it is a shame that they use these terms, since it is gives parents the false belief that their child isnt autistic at all, just has a pervasive developmental disorder.     My child is PDD, and the term means nothing to me. He is autistic (actually a better term would be mercury poisoned). I hope this helps.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">My assumption has always been that a pat on the shoulder mimics both what a child has seen others do, and also what has been done to him that he felt soothing.  I thought it did have an empathy piece.  Maybe for NT kids it\'s both?!?  They identify the feeling they have with particular behaviors and then can correctly interpret it in others and act accordingly?      What worries me about this is that \"our\" kids won\'t realize people can be deeply sad unless they are overtly crying.  Nor realize that people can be sad but act happy.  I wish there was somewhere to ask someone with autism this question.  I know gtto prefers her privacy, and rainman is just so cute I hate to annoy him.

I think the internet can be an echo chamber. One person reports something erroneous, then dozens of other web sites pick it up and pretty soon lots of people think something false is true because, well, it\'s all over the internet!   I don\'t think it helps the cause of autism to have serial killers and Hitler called autistic on the internet when those people have not been diagnosed with autism.   There are examples of very accomplished individuals who have been verifiably diagnosed with autism or Asperger\'s such as Dr. Temple Grandin, Dr. Stephen Shore and Donna Williams.</div>    I agree that it is hard to diagnose people who are no longer with us. But Autism experts do say Albert Einstein had a lot of autistic traits and, if he was living today, could be diagnosed with High Functioning Autism. Everybody who knows a little bit about Albert Einstein knows he could not talk until he was 4 years old! That\'s common in autism. And when he did start talking, he spoke only in echolalia until he was 7. And Dr Temple Grandin actually knows some of Albert\'s relatives and says there is a high rate of autism, dyslexia and a couple of other problems in Albert Einsteins family that is still living. You should watch the video on youtube called Einstein: the Autism Connection. It may make you think.    Jessica</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Kristen,    I\'d love to know more about your son.  Does he also display any of the other things as well?  Has your son been diagnosed with anything?  We just got back from Austin today and the Dr. didn\'t put a diagnosis on it.  He said he truly thinks our son is extremely gifted and highly intelligent, and may display some signs of some potentially obsessive compulsive type behavior.   He said he is definitely not on the autism spectrum.  He called what we described in our sons \"body movements\" as ticks....and said it could get better or could get worse before it gets better...or could get worse and not better.  He said by puberty, we should see a definite difference either way.  I would like to know more about your son\'s movements....or somehow see.  I have a few still pics of our son...I would like to trade some pics. with you sometime to see what you think.  I\'ve never seen another child do this sort of thing.  It\'s great to just talk with someone that has a child with similar symptoms.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Sorry to pipe in late on this but here is some info about weighted blankets. Weighted blankets are thought to help because deep pressure stimulation supplied by the weight in blanket releases a chemical in the brain, which naturally calms.  You can buy them but they can be expensive. Here is a link on how to make your own, however I would stuff it with poly pellets instead of old clothes. Poly-Pellets are a polypropylene product.   They are safe, machine washable and dryable, proven highly effective in applying deep pressure, hypoallergenic,  recommended and used by professionals as a superior weighting material. They sell them in fabric and craft stores such as Michael\'s.     <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://4h.missouri.edu/events/fashionrevue/blanket.pdf\">http://4h.missouri.edu/events/fashionrevue/blanket.pdf</a><!-- m -->    It is very important to consider some major points when purchasing or making a weighted blanket so that it will work properly for the user.     Major points to Consider    1. Goal to accomplish: Is the blanket to be used as a calming tool , for sleep or both.    2. What Is The Correct Size    3. What Is The Correct Weight    4. What Is The Correct Fabric      In deciding what to purchase the first thing to determine is what goal you want to accomplish with your weighted blanket.    If you need a blanket to be used as a calming tool in the car, watching TV, at school, in church, etc. The appropriate size would be a Lap blanket (34\" x 43\")or a Wrap blanket (43\" x 52\").    If you need a blanket for better sleep, the size you choose will depend on the height of the person using the blanket and /or the bed size. It is recommended that a weighted sleep blanket be made to  fit on the top of the mattress  and not hang over the sides of the bed, for smaller children.  Most teens and adults find that a full or queen size blanket is the most comfortable size for both sleep and as a calming tool. Also, in most cases, a  sleep blanket should always have the weights evenly distributed and NOT concentrated in one area.      A child under 40\" in height can use a Wrap blanket (43\" x 52) or a Crib/Toddler Blanket (36\" x 52\") for sleep. Once a height of 40\" in height is reached, a Twin size (43\" x 75)should be considered to give the young user plenty of growing room. Full size (54\" x 75\"), Queen Size (60\" x 80\"), are both  popular choices for teens, young adults and older adults.    CORRECT WEIGHT    Research shows the industry standard formula that most OT\'s or Occupational Therapists use to determine the starting weight for a blanket is to use 10% of the body weight and add one pound. For example a 100 pound person would start with an 11 pound blanket. This is the starting weight and many personal variables can factor in to that equation, in which the user would like the blanket heavier or lighter. They include, size of blanket and proprioceptive input needs of the user. Do not use a weighted blanket for sleep with a small child (under 40 pounds) or one who is really low tone. If it is too heavy it may affect a child\'s breathing while sleeping.     CORRECT FABRIC       Fabric type is one area that is often overlooked when purchasing a blanket. It is important to choose a blanket that is sensory comfortable to the user, and easily done with so many combinations available . A  cotton/cotton combination is the right choice for those that overheat easily. Many like a cotton/flannel combination, for a softer feel. A cotton /fleece combination makes a very soft blanket however because fleece is polyester and does not breathe as easily as cotton and flannel it would probably be avoided for those that overheat easily. The same holds true for a cotton/poly blend fabric. Satin edging , satin \"taggies\"or a washable satin backing also makes a nice blanket for those that crave a smooth \"cool\" feel.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Laura Mom to: Caitlin age 8 ASD Maegan age 11 NT</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Laura Mom to: Caitlin age 8 ASD Maegan age 11 NT</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">It does really hurt at first I think mostly because our dreams for them have all come crashing down and the sky is no longer the limit, it is now closer to the roof.  But as you learn about interventions and therapies you do start to get some of the dreams back in a more limited sense but they are there.    You so aren\'t alone and if at first an anonymous forum is more comfortable for you start here.  The people here are so great, supportive, and very non judmental.  Please take some time out once in a while to give yourself a break.  Get a trusted friend to watch them and go on a date with hubby, just the two of you this relationship is one of the ones that needs to be carefully nurtured during this time of great stress as we tend to get focused on our child and shut out our hubbies.    Also maybe revitalize an old hobbie something you can do for you from time to time.  One of the things I had to let go some of was how much I cared how my house looked.  Of course he has three sisters that help make the messes but something does have to give from time to time.I\'d rather it be housework than something important.    Sorry if I got preachy it was mostly faults I found in myself that I don\'t want others to have to go through also.  But everyone has their own balance to find, you will find yours.  It may take some time, and during this period cut yourself some slack.  You are more than welcome to rant, rave, cry or vent that\'s why were here.      My son also took a plunge into a large pond while I was watching his baby sister and someone else fished him out and told me off.  This was before we knew what was going on with him and was the first time he\'d done this.  I had no idea.  I was so scared when they told me what he\'d done.  But this helped me know to keep a really close eye on him.  It is exhausting, try to get as much rest as you can.  Easier said than done though hunh? <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /></div>'
