'<P>I actually respectfully disagree IBGECKO. ODD is often a comorbid disorder with HFA/AS. ODD is oppositional defiant disorder in case anyone is wondering.</P> <P>I think it would be a very wise idea to get him checked out by a developmental pediatrician (these docs have an additional 2 years of training in developmental issues past their pediatric training) and/or a pediatric neuropsychologist. Rages/tantrums are not uncommon among kids on the spectrum. I personally feel that ODD is just a part of some kids\' autism spectrum disorder and I know there are others that agree with me.</P> <P>I\'m not qualified to diagnose either - especially without seeing your child. However, the sensory issues, lack of eye contact, playing better with younger children, difficutly with expressive language and inappropriate expression of emotions are hallmarks of being on the spectrum. But again, you need to see a professional to really make sure. I would ask around and see who the best person to see is - not all professionals are created equal! <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley2.gif\" border=\"0\"> You might check at your local ARC agency and/or an autism/Asperger\'s support group. Parents of kids on the spectrum are the best resource for finding out who to see - they have fought hard to get what they have and usually are VERY willing to help those coming after them!

'Have you visited the classroom they are proposing putting him in? I would do that before I\'d agree to any placement. Of course, you\'ll have to remember that the kids you\'re seeing today are a year older than your son is now, but seeing a placement is the best way to know what possible issues will be. He may need a consultant to come in to bring the teacher and staff up to speed on his issues. He may need a one-on-one aide. He may not need much of anything. Seeing what the situation is will help you understand what he WILL need.'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I\'ve gotten myself very confused. DD was on Custom D-lactate Free until a few days ago. I thought she had a flare up of clostridia after a parasite cleanse, and I increased the probiotic and this seemed to help. She said the poop hurt, not while she was pooping, but on her skin, so that is why I thought the poop might have had an increase in acidic bacteria (?)  We switched her to VSL3, and overall it seems like a good change for her, but today she woke up from her nap hysterical and didn\'t calm down until I put her in a baking soda bath. Could she have gotten acidic from the VSL? Or from die off from the VSL?  Also I am noticing a few crystals in her diaper. She got this before, before we went on the LOD. Could switching to VSL be involved in this?  Overall she seems happier but more ADD-like. The ADD type behavior is typically associated with oxalates for her, but since VSL is supposed to help with oxalates, I\'m confused.  thanks for any advice!

' <div class=\"postbody\">We were only able to attend two days, but it was fantastic. There were SO many people there! It was so therapeutic also, to be in a room with so many other parents going through this. This just had to be the number one thing that made it worth going. When I think of the rough days ahead, I now know that so many others are going through it as well - and even in worse ways.     I learned a LOT about how crucial ALL the pieces are to the process of healing the gut and fixing the methlyation process. I think the overall aim is to heal, then fix this process so that the body can produce glutathione and detox like it should. But every single thing is important . .zinc levels, magnesium, B6, etc. - it all has to be there.    Right now our son is STILL deficient in zinc and magnesium, so the other stuff can\'t work. Now I see why that is all so important and why I have to fix those issues before we can procede.     There are also other metals that can cause problems ...aluminum, antimony, lead, etc. They can be there w/o tests that show they are. Detox is important, either through chelation or natural means.     Anyway, it was GREAT. I feel very empowered and not so alone.  Some of the parent to parent sessions were also fantastic. SCD diet is BIG for a lot of parents/kids right now - more than I knew. I talked to one mom who had used it and made me feel that it was doable for our family as well. I probably will head in that direction soon. - as soon as I can get through this semester in mid-May.     Enzymes were not really stressed, though. I wonder about that. Many parents use them, but don\'t rely on them as the cure-all.    P.S. - I\'m sorry that I did not get to \"see\" any of you that were there. The nametags didn\'t really work that way.

'Another think that you might want to consider. There is some research out there that shows that kids on the autism spectrum don\'t toilet train until they are at the point of putting together two word phrases that are COMMUNICATIVE. This does not seem to be because they need language to learn about toileting. It seems to be neuro/developmental. That the brain is developed enough to toilet train at about the same time it is ready to communicate in more than one word. If you think about it, that\'s EXACTLY how it works with NT kids. NT boys are know to train later and they are also known to talk later. Is it such a shock that our kids, who are know to talk even later, are not ready to toilet until later? If you look at the thread about what age did our kids train, I think you\'ll see that the majority were at least 4, many 5 or even school age. IMHO, these people are trying to do something unnatural with your child. If you feel strongly about it, DO NOT ALLOW IT. As this child\'s parent, you have that right.'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Autism has been around for 60 years and has been closely studied for decades by psychologists and related professionals.   If autism and giftedness are related, this relationship would  have been uncovered long time ago.  There is no scientific study to my knowledge that shows autism and giftedness are significantly correlated.   We know that there a few autistic savants (the number is small and in double digits, compared to perhaps hundreds of thousands of autistics around the world).     I have looked at gifted student population in my school district and it\'s around 10% of the general student population which means 90% of general population are not gifted.  So, even if 10% of the autistics are gifted, we have an overwhelming majority of 90% of autistics who are not gifted.           If autistic people are gifted, where are they?   Is there any autistic among top 100 living musicians, writers, architects, painters, mathematicians etc.             It\'s possible that autism and giftedness are related and autism may be suppressing the giftedness.  What\'s the point of this giftedness? It\'s like trading your eyes for a nice painting.      I too wish to believe that autism is giftedness but the evidence we have so far point to that autism -- for the most part-- is a profound disability.</div>'

'Give it until the end of the school year before making a class change. When my DD first started pre-school, it was really rough and she made limited progress from Sept through January. That was when we moved her to the special ed pre-school at the school district. From Feb-June, again, she made limited progress and it was downright discouraging at times. The next school year she did much better. She did a total turn around, and during that school year she started attending kindergarten for 2 hours. By the end of the year she was full time in kindergarten. I think she had to get used to the setting and her communications had to improve before her overall performance improved. I also think having role models for behavior helped. If she had been in the class with lower functioning kids, she wouldnt have developed as fast as she did. Good luck, focus on the postive. Observe the other class. If you feel your child is too high functioning, then dont move him. He needs the positive role models that the higher functioning kids will help provide.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Jana</div>'

'You can ask for an FBA at ANY time. And, since it is an evaluation, it is subject to IEE rules, which means you can get an independent eval afterwards if you don\'t agree with it. But, personally, I think it\'s best to go with the results of the FBA and use the resulting BIP (into which you definitely can have input) and the success or failure or the BIP will tell if the FBA is correct. If the BIP fails, have the authors adjust it. This is going to be a process.'

'<P>Okay, after the losing him on the bus incident (see post from a few days ago if you\'re interested), the school seems to be stepping up.</P> <P>The ASD teacher called me to check in and to tell me that ds seems to be anxious toward the end of the day and asking how much longer they have. She said that unless you were looking for it, it is not noticeable and a lot of the other kids (NT) are anxious too because it IS A 6 1/2 hour day. But, she wants to schedule two 10-minute gross motor breaks for ds - one in the am and one in the pm. She will have him deliver mail to different parts of the building and maybe do 2 or 3 different ones so that he gets a long walk and some time away in addition. Also, she\'s going to take him to the resource room to finish lunch if he doesn\'t get to finish. His class has a bathroom break right after lunch which is 10 minutes, so she can give him about 7-8 minutes to finish up (they only get 20 minutes to eat) and then swing him by the bathroom and go to class. All of this will not interfere and not make him stand out. She said he seems to be interacting and is following routines great and doing everything that is asked of him. She just wants to be pro-active and not have his anxiety increase. She told me she didn\'t want him \"sent\" to her room - she wants to invite him to her resource room when he needs it so he ends up being able to eventually do it on his own when he needs it. </P> <P>The principal sat with he and 4-5 other kindergarteners who didn\'t finish their lunch today and chatted with him and made sure he was able to finish more of his lunch. He usually is able to eat in 20 minutes, but with all the noise and the kids talking to him - he just didn\'t budget his time well. </P> <P>Anyway, she also threw out a few other ideas but said she absolutely wants him to be doing everything the other kids are as much as possible and she believes he will be able to and has been impressed with how he has done so far. He is definitely the mildest on her caseolad, she said and she said that a layperson would not pick out that he was even having any issues. She just could read it on his face that he needed a break. So, tomorrow we start doing that. </P> <P>Well, I gotta go get ready for our garage sale, but just had to share that after a rocky start - the school (especially the ASD teacher and principal) seem to really have a handle on my ds - after only really knowing him for 2 1/2 days so far!) is doing good. They are WAY better than his previous school and I actually told the ASD teacher that I was floored that she was calling me to work on PREVENTING a future problem rather than waiting until one happened - because that was not my experience at his previous school.

I know about the more severley functioning autistics ive met plenty    I would like to see their lives get better they dont seem too happy to me sometimes  .    sometimes i will admit i have trouble seeing not everyones autism is as high functioning as mine.     and i need to be helped with this and helped to understand what the familys going through so i can help them.     since im the only preson at my leval of it ive ever known personally in my entire 20 year exsistense     if fine Men like you can help these kids and young adults with Biomed go right ahead i find it interesting what you told me about the kids at your clinic.     quite frankly i wish some of these options were availible to me when i was small but i did good with what i could.    It kind of feels like being in suspended animation and waking up in the future when i heard some things it could be overwheliming.

He locked another kid (not S.) in a closet and threw a book at S..      Plus some mother (wonder who it could be?) wrote letters to the spiritual director of the school, the head of the PTA, the head of the order of sisters that run the school, and the bishop about the continued bullying.  That mother all sent copies of each letter written to the principal to the above people and threatened to attend class EVERY DAY with S. until the bullying was addressed.

'Not sure who should do the observation. I am guessing that the distraction is caused by something, and whoever diagnosed the something would be the person who best understands the reasons for the distraction. So this person would be the one to do the observation. This statement (now that I think about it) has a bunch of assumptions built into it. I am assuming that if you have a diagnosis, it was not a school person who did it, and so this person would be able to independently do the observation. If your case is different you\'d need an outside specialist in the area that leads to the distractability.<br><br>An FBA might help since being distracted would be a behavior that impacts school work. Depends on the quality of the person doing it, and writing up the results. If this is a school person, I would not be surprized if they write all over the report \"We don\'t see any of mom\'s concerns in the classroom.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Okay- here\'s a thought.  I have lots of these every day, just not all good ones.  IF he seems to like the toys with a lot of buttons, noises, whatever, you have a couple of options:  1)Use these as \'rewards\' for behavior that is desirable.  IF he waits for two minutes, half a minute, whatever you deem appropriate for his age and ability.  My son\'s receptive language is still quite iffy--yesterday he was throwing rocks, and I honestly believe that he has no clue what \"you could hurt someone\" means.  Again, you have to decide what he is capable of.  Once he has a toy that he wants, set a timer to allow him to play with it for ten minutes, or fifteen or a half-hour.  It will help him to grasp the concept of time length.  THEN he has to do something else that YOU want to do.  He can hear the timer go off, and eventually he will understand time limits and transitions.  2)Get rid of most of the toys he wants to play with that are causing him <em>excessive</em> stimming.  It sounds harsh, but we have had to do that with my son, because I would have lost my mind long ago with the constant repetition of sounds. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" />   I just can\'t handle it after so long.  He still is getting the concept of \"enough!\" and I feel like a bad mom when I can\'t take it anymore.    Ultimately, I think that the aspie kids give good advice.  Try to redirect his stimming to something that is not self-injurious.  When you think about it, the excess of stimming can be injurious to social skills.  Other kids don\'t have the paitence or understanding that parents do.    One other thing--tantrums are IMO a good sign of autonomy--of your son\'s \"sense of self.\"  He knows what he wants, and he is figuring out what methods work to get it.  The manipulation begins.....smart boy...</div>'

Our 3 yr old has autism and our 2 yr old shows the red flags, but we are still working with him in \'hopes\' it is purely sensory issues (however, he has significant language delay).</P> <P>We have had mostly positive experiences w/ professionals talking to us about our kids. These professionals defniately talk to me differently than DH who tends to be more sensitive in that he feels everyone is judging his abilities as a parent. I think that as a professional, you and others should trust your instincts in reading the non-verbal (and verbal) cues of the parents...then cater how you discuss issues based on that. For instance, the OT is very open and blunt with me about my childrens progress and what I need to work on at home. However, her comments are more reserved and presented in a way where DH doesn\'t feel he is being judged or criticized. I know that it sounds silly for him to be acting like this, but how can parents (especially the man) not help but feel some guilt...he is still dealing with it.</P> <P>As for me, I want to know everything, including suggestions as to what I can do at home to be consistent with the activities my child learns at school or at therapy. </P> <P>As for the worst experience, that would be the ST who evauated my ds during an EI evaluation.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Dory,  Who told you that you have to have approval for your son to stay home?  Was it the people at Connection\'s Academy?  I couldn\'t find any information in any of the charter school laws that apply to Florida that suggest that a special ed student needs approval from anyone.  Generally, charter schools are first come first served admittance regardless of a student\'s background.  Because charter schools are publicly funded, they must take all children from a qualifying district, just as a traditional school would.  Now, the laws seem to be a bit different in Florida than here in Oregon.  Here, the child\'s home school district is responsible for providing any necessary special ed services, whereas in Florida, it appears that the charter schools themselves must provide the services.  So, we may be dealing with a situation where online charter schools <em>can\'t</em>  provide services because of the nature of the schooling.  Still, as the parent of your child, you should not need permission from anyone to enroll him in a school of <em>choice.</em>.  If you want some help, I can have my husband try to find out what the exact requirements are in Florida.    Also, as an alternative, I\'m not sure if you have come across any information regarding the McKay scholarship program which was established in Florida to allow parents of special needs kids to remove their children from their home district and place them in any public or private school of their choice.  Here\'s a link <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.floridaschoolchoice.org/Information/McKay/\">http://www.floridaschoolchoice.org/Information/McKay/</a><!-- m -->  Now, it appears the deadline has already passed for the first part of the upcoming school year, but you may be able to apply for the second half of the year.  From what I\'ve read, most public and private schools will aceept McKay scholarship kids, so you should have a decent selection of schools to choose from if you go that route.

He is still pretty oblivious to alot of things about himself (or maybe not!) but it still seems that way and if i tell him he has autism and i can just picture him crying and screaming I HAVE AUTISM over and over loudly during a meltdown. </P> <P>Horizon, when i met with his teacher i told her i was worried him not being able to stim freely will make his behavior worse since he usually stims here and there sporadically all thruout the day and i asked if they could have a spot for him to go where he could stim privately like on a bean bag chair or something, so ill see about that monday. The good thing is that I have always told him that everyone is different like some people are light colored some are dark, some are bald some have lots of hair etc. so he himself says out loud \'Everybodys different\' thruout the day when he sees someone (or on tv) whos physically different in some way.</P> <P>Tzoya, I myself felt relieved in some sense when i found out aspergers so I guess it would help him tremendously to know but even tho he obviously knows hes different whether he was told or noticed himself i dont think he will be able to understand that he has autism. Explaining things to him are very hard he doesnt seem to grasp things correctly. Other than yesterday I havnt seen anything else that made me think he thinks hes different he is usually completely oblivious even if people are starring at him (unless hes grumpy). I love the idea of havign the doctor explain it to him. Hes had many dx\'s already but his neuro is a very kind understanding man so I think i may talk to him about talking to my son as well as us letting him know. I can understand how ur story is similar here I just wish I knew he noticed this before <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley18.gif\" border=\"0\"></P> <P>Micki, thats so cute and its great ur son is confident liike that! That is how i want my son to be and i need to get cracking before his self esteem gets completely shot down. I love the way u put it about them having thier weakness\'s and strenghts. </P> <P>I am actually having a hard time dealing with this while my son is being his normal self I cant stop thinking about yesterday and bawling my eyeballs out, i feel so tired and have a huge headache from crying so much, of course the fact that its that time of the month probably isnt helping me. My husband thinks im obsessing and that its normal to be teased and we cant shelter him but hes worried himself because this is how he was as a kid but he was more of an angry lashing out chlld more than our son is who is really sensitive so hes worried too. Im totally scared that this is happening in kindergarten, I am extremely sensitive so I think thats why im obsessing over this too much myself. I totally hate this. </P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by 143hayden on August 16 2008 at 1:59pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS-8 ASD/Seizures/Mood dis/OCD/ADHD/S.I.D./Tics/GF-CF-Soy Free diet  For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord...plans 2 give you hope & a future Jer. 29:11</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">You\'re welcome! I don\'t have any \'test\" results but at this stage in the game I can tell just by his actions. The next day was a difference ~ and the whole first week was a dramatic difference. There was a day or two of regression and he seemed pretty good again. Then we went to Disney and I kept him on it but he blew his diet, got allergies and just general sensory overload put him back into crying/tantrum mode. He\'s getting back to normal now.     I tried taking him on and off the pro bio gold to see if I saw a difference but I don\'t think I did. Like I said, it almost seemed to make him more sensitive to some \"safe\" foods. I did however, see a difference when I took him on and off of DMG. Just as an FYI, he isn\'t really gluten sensitive but sensitive to a lot of fruits. And we just stay away from dairy as a general rule.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Our daughter turned 3 last week. she is still pretty much nonverbal. we originally thought she was just speech delayed . This is what everyone told us even her pediatrician . As a precaution we set up an evaluation and recieved an Autism disorder diagnosis that day. This hit us like a hammer. My wife originally did not want to believe it ,this lasted for a few weeks. As we learned more about the spectrum things started coming together.     Our daughter is a well behaved child , and has always been loving torwards us. She seemed to hit every mildstone in time, besides speaking. Looking back now we realize when she sarted to show symptoms os ASD. at around 20 months  she stopped doing the few things she had learned , like saying no and waiving bye. She stopped clapping her hands with us and become more independent. she would respond to her name less often and acted as though deaf. Her diet also become more limited although her appetite is always good. At around that age she also started not liking certain people for no reason. She hated company. She also started losing interst in toys .    In the last 2 months she has made obvious improvements on several fronts , which reassures are hope for her future.    Realizing  our daughter is not developing properly has been the hardest thing we ever had to deal with . It can certainly be described as a nightmare that will not go away . The word Autism still hurts.      Basically our approach now is not to worry about the label and focus on the treatment . Whether a child is Autistic or not but exhibits delays the treatment is the same and can only benefit her . In less than 2 months of us knowing her dx , she has made such positive strides. At this pace we have everyreason to believe she will be mainstreamed eventually .    Good luck to you . For me finding out my family is not the only one has made a bi difference . The grieve and pain we felt when  we were given her diagnosis has not gone away , but each day is a little more bearable.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Everyone has their own experience.  Mine was much different so in my world, biomed is <strong>the</strong> answer.  My son has proven this to me time and time again through the many biomed treatments we\'ve tried.     I believe many parents do give supplement breaks.  Many kids do have infractions, mine included.  However, unlike this person\'s experience, the results have been negative.   Though now, after he\'s had a chance to heal if we give him a supplement break, he\'s fine.  And we see additional gains when we add some supps back in.  Back one year ago, if my son ate gluten, he\'d be pooing his pants and acting stange for 2 weeks minimum.  Now after healing, he can tolerate small amounts.  There are so many biomed treatments out there.  And kids are so different.   IT\'s so hard to speculate on other people\'s situations.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Jen! <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">So</span> glad you checked in.  I\'m sorry your\'re struggling with your oldest. Please try not to be so hard on yourself.  In your shoes, many would not have hung in as long as you have.  You\'re a mom to 3 little ones, not just one, and you have to love and protect each of them and do what is best for your family.  This is obviously not an easy decision or one you take lightly, and I\'m sure that many people in your shoes would do the same - I\'m know I would.  Gosh, I think it\'s challenging enough to parent 3 little ones at the same time, let alone dealing with all of the confusion and contradictions of autism and the aggression that your son is showing right now!  I hope that you find some relief for your son and your family with medication.  Even if it only provides enough relief for you to maintain your sanity while sifting through all of the other options and possibilities, it will be worth it.     I know what you mean about the DAN approach.  Although I have been fortunate to see many positives, I have also been recently disillusioned by some aspects, and I think that in some cases it isn\'t much different than traditional medicine in that at times not enough consideration is given to the individual children and their families.       I really hope you\'ll keep in touch.  Are you still considering taking your boys to see Krigsman?  Where in PA do you live, btw - if you don\'t mind sharing?</div>'

I am currently taking a course on parent advocacy and I hear from other parents in this class about what the school is doing or not doing for their kids and the speakers, moderators etc tell them the same thing. You have to advocate for your child. NONE AND I MEAN NONE of the special ed laws that are now in force were inacted because a senator or govenor etc said gee.... maybe we should help some of the children that need special education. All of the laws are in place because parents advocated for them. The only way to continue to receive add\'l services is to get groups of parents if you have to and advocate for our children. Even in the early 80\'s there were not the same laws we have now, and the only reason our children are even allowed to attend public school is because parents forced the issue.

'<FONT size=2>Some Mothers Get Babies With Something More<BR>written by: Lori Borgman<BR>Columnist and Speaker<BR><BR>My friend is expecting her first child. People keep asking what she wants. She smiles demurely, shakes her head and gives the answer mothers have given throughout the pages of time. She says it doesn\'t matter whether it\'s a boy or a girl. She just wants it to have ten fingers and ten toes. Of course, that\'s what she says. That\'s what mothers have always said. Mothers lie. Truth be told, every mother wants a whole lot more.<BR><BR>Every mother wants a perfectly healthy baby with a round head, rosebud lips, button nose, <BR>beautiful eyes and satin skin. Every mother wants a baby so gorgeous that people will pity the Gerber baby for being flat-out ugly. Every mother wants a baby that will roll over, sit up and take those first steps right on schedule (according to the baby development chart on page 57, column two). Every mother wants a baby that can, see, hear, run, jump and fire neurons by the billions. She wants a kid that can smack the ball out of the park and do toe points that are the envy of the entire ballet class. Call it greed if you want, but we mothers want what we want.<BR><BR>Some mothers get babies with something more. Some mothers get babies with conditions they can\'t pronounce, a spine that didn\'t fuse, a missing chromosome or a palette that didn\'t close. Most of those mothers can remember the time, the place, the shoes they were wearing and the color of the walls in the small, suffocating room where the doctor uttered the words that took their breath away. It felt like recess in the fourth grade when you didn\'t see the kick ball coming and it knocked the wind clean out of you.<BR><BR>Some mothers leave the hospital with a healthy bundle, then, months, even years later, take him in for a routine visit, or schedule her for a well check, and crash head first into a brick wall as they bear the brunt of devastating news. It can\'t be possible! That doesn\'t run in our family. Can this really be happening in our lifetime?<BR><BR>I am a woman who watches the Olympics for the sheer thrill of seeing finely sculpted bodies. It\'s not a lust thing; it\'s a wondrous thing. The athletes appear as specimens without flaw - rippling muscles with nary an ounce of flab or fat, virtual powerhouses of strength with lungs and limbs working in perfect harmony. Then the athlete walks over to a tote bag, rustles through the contents and pulls out an inhaler. As I\'ve told my own kids, be it on the way to physical therapy after a third knee surgery, or on a trip home from an echo cardiogram, there\'s no such thing as a perfect body. Everybody will bear something at some time or another. Maybe the affliction will be apparent to curious eyes, or maybe it will be unseen, quietly treated with trips to the doctor, medication or surgery. The health problems our children have experienced have been minimal and manageable, so I watch with keen interest and great admiration the mothers of children with serious disabilities, and wonder how they do it.<BR><BR>Frankly, sometimes you mothers scare me. How you lift that child in and out of a wheelchair 20 times a day. How you monitor tests, track medications, regulate diet and serve as the gatekeeper to a hundred specialists yammering in your ear. I wonder how you endure the cliches and the platitudes, well-intentioned souls explaining how God is at work when you\'ve occasionally questioned if God is on strike. I even wonder how you endure schmaltzy pieces like this one - saluting you, painting you as hero and saint, when you know you\'re ordinary. You snap, you bark, you bite. You didn\'t volunteer for this. You didn\'t jump up and down in the motherhood line yelling, \"Choose me, God! Choose me! I\'ve got what it takes.\" You\'re a woman who doesn\'t have time to step back and put things in perspective, so, please, let me do it for you.<BR><BR>From where I sit, you\'re way ahead of the pack. You\'ve developed the strength of a draft horse while holding onto the delicacy of a daffodil. You have a heart that melts like chocolate in a glove box in July, carefully counter-balanced against the stubbornness of an Ozark mule.

' <div class=\"postbody\">1) You don\'t need a DX at age 3 to get early in pre k, just meet need based on their testings.  In fact you don\'t need a medical dx until age 6, when medicaid pays to the school for treatments, and are more stringent.  2)  I always stressed over early on my son wasn\'t learning.  BUT HE WAS! He just demonstrated it in is own time.  I am filled with hope recently because literally within the last 3 months, he has EXPLODED with gains.  He would do one word only, especially no, no gesturing, grabbing my hand to take me to what it was he wanted.  Now he\'s had one instance of two full sentences in a row! (spoken to his OT when mad at her for making him work, pointed at the door, and said &quot;Get out of here!  Leave me alone!&quot;  And several other small sentences.  He sits down with <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> and can essentially quote the entire book now (yes we\'ve read it 3 times a day for 3 years...)

'<P>My ds was on tenex earlier this year, and it didn\'t help. We ended up stopping the tenex, and starting him on risperdal, and most recently zoloft. My son is also usually very well behaved at school, and saves the worst of his behavior for when he is at home. I think it\'s because while at school, he doesn\'t want to stand out from the other kids, and when he\'s at home, he is in his comfort zone. He doesn\'t have to worry about keeping it together anymore, so the behaviors that he has been holding back all day are let loose at home. </P> <P>It sounds as if things are in a crisis situation right now with your son. I would call your regular pediatrician ASAP for an immediate appt, and see if your ped can get your son in to see the neurologist or a psychiatrist before February. Sometimes when a referral comes from another doctor, especially if there are concerns, they might be able to make an appt sooner than what you are able to make when you call for an appt. </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- L~    Mom to Sarah 14 NT, Michael 13 ASD, ADHD and Jonathon 9 NT</div>'

Maybe I shouldn\'t have used the word \"data\" as it was probably more a comment from personal experience.   Unfortunately, I was so focused on other things there that I jotted a note down and didn\'t write who the comment was attributed to.  HBOT for us is down the road, so I wasn\'t really tuned into it as much.  Crystal\'s question just rang a bell, and I remembered that I had jotted down that somebody said at the conference that oxidative stress at the low pressures was more of a possibility than a probability and that they were not seeing it in their experience -- I really wish that I had taken a better note here, but I know I\'m not making this one up since I\'ve sort of just begun to study HBOT, and the whole oxidative stress issue is one that I have just recently (just before the conference) become aware of.     I\'ll stay out of this debate (since it looks like there is one), though, because my knowledge ends with what I heard at the conference and through some internet searches to find out where people are taking their ASD kids.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</div>'
'<P>I\'m new but just had to jump in here about homeschool. I hs my son for year n\'half. After he went from a small private school where he was thriving academically to a ps where he began regressing both behaviorally and academically. At this point we were just in the process of having him tested, not through school but privately. The school refused to make the slightest of accommodations until an IEP was in place. I had to make a decision to either expend my energy educating my child or fighting a school district. Since I have an MA in education, I chose to educate him. After about three months of being home, our behavioral ped couldn\'t believe the change in my son. For third grade we chose to send him to a different school district, his teacher made the comment that he has adjusted wonderfully, is socially connecting with other children, participating in classroom discussion and is academically on track (although he struggles with reading and spelling.) She went on to say, \"he\'s not as withdrawn as other homeschooled kids I\'ve had.\" Hmmmm, most homeschooled kids I know are very bright, outgoing individuals. </P> <P>Although having my asd son at home was challenging, and I had many a day where I wished it were someone else dealing with his frustration, it was also very rewarding. One of the most positive aspects is to tailor a program that fits your child instead of making your child fit a program. For example, timed test really increase my sons frustration level. He\'s been told at school ( and I\'ve been told) that unless he is timed he can\'t recieve a certificate for that level. So he endures the timed test because he wants the certificate. As a homeschooler time is not of the essence but rather do you know the facts...hmmmm, what a concept for education. His principal tells me that he (my son) needs to feel accomplished by completing the timed multiplication test. I say when he sits down and completes the test in HIS time (which at home is about 1 minute 20 seconds while at school he must complete it in one minute) and gets all the problems right - trust me he feels accomplished - he is up on his tiptoes jumping up and down saying \"Look mom, I did great!\" </P> <P>I get so tired of trying to make children fit into a \"normed\" box. I read an article not to long ago theorizing the thought that autism may not be the disability but rather the disability lies within the society that they must exist. In other words if our world was \"things\" oriented rather than people oriented who of us would have the disability?????</P>'
'<P>My son is on Risperdol and has tics. Risperdol is used off label to treat Tourette\'s. Sometimes when the medicine needs to be increased, the underlying tic becomes pronounced, which may be what you are seeing.</P> <P>There is always the risk of tradive dyskenisia, but generally on very high doses of Risperdol. My son takes 4MG/day, which is approaching the maximum dosage for his age/size. My doctor says he doesn\'t feel comfortable going above 5 mg but thinks that under 5 mg is \"safe\" at least with my son who is 12 and approx. 120- 125 pounds.</P> <P>I would call your doctor. He/she will probably lower the Risperdol to see if the symptoms improve or worsten. If they worsten that would indicate that the medicine needs to be increased.</P> <P>If you google Tardive Dyskenesia photos, the majority show a movement with the lips and tounge, not so much the head. <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley31.gif\" border=\"0\"> Good luck.

' <div class=\"postbody\">If you are 3 months into GFCF and are seeing good results, enzymes are probably a good thing to add to aid in digestion but not necessarily to stray from the diet.      I understand how hard the diet is to maintain. I have 2 young boys on the spectrum both GFCFSFCF w/a variety of different intolerances and allergies.  I prepare 80% of what they eat from scratch and they don\'t eat the same foods.     There are ways you can try to improve your son\'s eating that may not be too taxing on you.  Does he eat fruit, legal fruit leather, packaged GFCF baked goods, pretzels, popcorn, potato chips, rice pasta, rice bread, etc.??  Believe me, I know how hard it is but if you are seeing good results, going off the diet, even w/enzymes, could be disastrous.      The other way to add calories/nutrition is to add in a protein powder.  My oldest son refuses to eat first thing in the a.m. and I have to get him to school.  I\'ve added in brown rice-based protein powder to his a.m. supplement drink and it keeps him full and energetic until his morning snack.    If you have to have an infraction, then definitely give enzymes and keep a close watch on your son for physical symptoms (bloated belly, diahrea, headaches, eczema, etc.) and for behavioral symptoms (hyperactivity, sleeplessness, nightwakings, increased stimming).  I would hate to see him lose any of his gains.      Hang in there and best of luck!    Dana R.</div>'

The adding of probiotic and a yeast killer will populate the gut with good bacteria ... and its easier than when you have bad bacteria and you have to replace it with good. So it can get good fast ... and guess what ... its very sustainable.  I\'d consider adding goat yogurt with live cultures ... hard as it might be to find/make ... Yogurt works like nothing else, you can eat it all day and literally it does everything for you, take care of constipation without creating diarrhea ... helps digestion, proctects against ulcers ... everything.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi and welcome to the board it is a hard diagnosis to have even if you already know it is still a blow.  Your kids are lucky to have you to fight for them and get them the help they need.  You will find most of what you need for that here from other parents who have already fought the battles or are currently going through the same things you are.  I understand the reluctance to start on biomed it took me two years of reading other parents experiences and doing my own research to decide to do it and then I only started with eliminating milk it was several more months before we eliminated gluten and wonder of wonders if he didn\'t finally start sleeping all night and potty train.  Even if you don\'t do biomed the GFCF diet has also been recomended for ADHD as well as autism, I found that out from my NT daughters school nurse.    You will have a pretty steep learning curve but realize that this is a marathon not a sprint you have time to learn and remember to take a breather once in a while.  Take care of yourself so you can take care of them.  Again welcome to one of the greatest support forums out there, it is the only reason I kept my sanity for the first few years of my sons diagnosis, I\'m sure it can help you too.  If you do decide to try the diet email me I have a bunch of tips on cooking, recipes, eating out and an eight page list of safe foods most of which can be found at the average grocery store.  <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:mouseker1@gmail.com\">mouseker1@gmail.com</a><!-- e --></div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">My son went to Dr. Kaplan\'s office in Tarrytown, NY for a few months.   My son is a toe walker and I was hoping that the prism lenses would help for that.  He went to the office for vision therapy once a week and was given exercies to perform at home everyday.  It helped him learn body awareness.  They said he should wear the glasses for about 1 year and do the exercises every day.       I had just had a baby and the office was about an hour away, it became too difficult traveling to the office once a week with three kids.

The psychiatrist chose this, because I mentioned that I\'ve heard that typical stimulants often increase anxiety in children who already have that tendency (which Jake does).

'If he does is when he\'s mad he might do it because he gets confused.<br> Normally a child recognizes anger and the feelings with it, with autism the child might be confused about what it\'s experiencing. The headbanging takes the confusion away by giving very mild pain, but more importantly the painkillers. The older a child gets, the more force it can use and therefore increase the chance of injuring itself, so a plan to teach your child to stop doing it might be a good idea.<br>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Crystal,    Your thread entitled \"Sasha said his first word during HBOT yesterday\" regarding your son\'s first words in the hbot chamber on Jan 25, 2006, was a very inspiring post.  This type of information is very compelling to other parents, which is obvious from the number of responses that followed.  That is a very powerful testimony, and it is important that it is accurate, as readers may attribute that milestone to the hbot treatment.

We went to see her this Saturday and she had a 4 hour session with Sasha and he said his first word since Autism today.

Doing so diminishes the testimonies of parents everywhere.  I found many other descrepanices of information on this board, but these were the most important points.  As Crystal has rudely suggested to prior posters on the autismweb board, perhaps interested parties can use the search feature on the Alabama board to read more.  As you did in your skirmishes on several other boards when your information is questioned, you will probably claim to be attacked, claim that readers misunderstood, layer on off-topic info, suggest the topic is dropped when you exhaust alternative explanations, and finally resort to name-calling (in this thread -- name du jour is \"jerk\" apparently).  Its a pattern.  Just stick with the truth, and btw, this is not it:  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Actually I said that they could come use it for free.</div>    Nope you never said that.  Sorry.  And you didnâ€™t mention anything about doctors being involved anywhere.  The post was removed as you were soliciting in the support forum, which is a no no on a lot of parent message boards, as you have no doubt learned by now.    And really, posting member names on another forum is such a cheap shot -- hopefully interested readers will take a little time to read on the Alabama forum and make that determination on their own.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Ayurvedic medications are not laced with metals unless they were made in a factory. Typically they are plants. Metal traces are from a factory.  I do remember facts from 14 years ago, since I was 22 years old at that time. In fact I remember everything I studied in fields of engineering and mathematics and computer programming as well since I base my living on it and remember the non engineering parts as well even though I dont use it. However I cannot show it to you as proof that it was even printed.  As for IM or sub Q its all the same thing, your stomach and intestines do not get a chance to excrete it. Look up the recent mercury in burger incident - someone decided it will be a cool prank and put mercury in a fast food burger and this lady I believe ate most of it before finding it and it happened in the US. The docs said it will be excreted. Lead, arsenic and mercury all accumulate in your body. You may excrete 90% and that will remove the immediate fatality, but it will add to the previous consumption and eventually do damage. People die eating paint chips because they have been eating it for years and they ahve enough of it to cause serious harm.   Ayurvedic medications do not by themselves have mercury, we typically use whole plants or parts of plants. Start making them in a factory because urbanisation has killed the fields and woods and you have a whole other story. We have used leaded gasoline and other poisons as well as 2 stroke oil burners clear into the late 90\'s, but back in the 80\'s and 70\'s we had so few automobiles it was so amazingly clean.   In any case, autism as a condition and as a term is balloning in india and china and seems to be in step with the vaccine program. It may also be in step with the industrialisation which has accelerated the pace at which toxins are dumped into the air/water. In either case metals are at the heart of it.

Some kids tend to be more fever-prone than others, and it\'s the body\'s way of fighting infection.  So I would guess that he may have a fever to combat an \"invisible\" infection, that is, one with no other detectable symptoms.  One thing I learned from the article is that the severity of the temperature may have nothing to do with the underlying cause.  So he may get a high fever with a slight cold, but run a low-grade fever with a raging ear infection.  Interesting....

' <div class=\"postbody\">I\'ve got a lot to say on this particular topic so excuse me if this is TMI, but just my thoughts:  My biggest issue with RDI is that I think it is kind of wishy-washy and vague, a fact that, in my personal opinion, they hide behind a lot of elaborate vocabulary.   For example, a consultant might say: &quot;We need to use multi-modal broadband communication to promote dynamic intelligence. We will be addressing the core deficits of autism by restructuring the environment in order to provide the child the opportunity to relearn skills from a crucial missed stage of development. Your child will learn about facial referencing and nonverbal communication as an apprentice in the guided participation relationship&quot;  Yes, phrased like that, parents may feel like shelling out the thousands of bucks that this program costs. Now let\'s rephrase in plain English:   &quot;Kids with autism have trouble with facial expressions and body language. During the day, make a point of using more exaggerated facial expressions and gestures, and try to make sure you child pays attention to them vs. tuning out because cartoons are on in the background.&quot;  Phrased like that, it sounds a lot more like common sense and nothing particularly earth-shattering. Too me, that was my opinion on a lot of the program - once you got past the hype and the elaborate terminology it was just common sense and nothing revolutionary. Revolutionary, to me, would be a teaching method that was scientifically shown to somehow help autistic children suddenly understand nonverbal communication. Trying to use more nonverbal communication and drawing the child\'s attention to it - that could be summarized in a quick bullet point in a pamphlet and be just as useful to parents, without such an involved program or a consultant.  My second huge issue with the program was/are the Parent Goals. Oy vey! Seriously, I\'m hearing about parents doing months of parent goals in order to \'prepare\' for the child goals. I found the parent goals obnoxious, for want of a better word. They might include the parent writing an essay on where they see their child in 10 years, or proving to the consultant that they are \'journaling\' every day. Um, what? Early intervention is so crucial, I want to pull my hair out when someone tells me parents should wait months to focus on child-oriented therapy so that they can learn to \'journal\'. Seriously.  Other general issues with the program, again, only my opinion:  - Not backed up by adequate scientific evidence or controlled studies, especially for all the claims made.  - Can be very expensive. Access to the online system alone is about $600 a year plus the cost of a consultant, who typically seem to charge $3000-$8000 for a six month \'package\'. Some consultants require you attend the parent training in Houston, which is another few thousand plus time off work and travel, and I believe it is mandatory that both parents attend together, so then there is the cost of child care. (Also, you have to attend the Introductory conference or buy the DVD before you can attend the Parent Conference.) It is largely video-tape based so you need a digital camera and a computer capable of handling the videos.  - This therapy is owned. Oh boy, is it owned, trademark and all. The owners can and have made sweeping changes to the program, and they can make these changes based on nothing but their own opinions if they choose. In therapies like ABA, parents can work with an ABA therapist who is more in line with their way of thinking. In RDI, if consultants do not do RDI the way the owners prescribe they can be booted out of the program.  - Generally relies heavily on videos, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming for families already dealing with an autistic child. Often, consultants want you to tape the activity, do whatever reformats/uploads are needed, upload it to their operating system (which, in my experience was never up or incredibly slow,) edit it, etc., etc. To me, that is an unacceptable amount of time haggling with digital video vs. interacting with the actual child.  - Consultants, increasingly, are telling families that in order to work with them they must quit other therapies such as ABA and Floortime. I have a big issue with telling families they have to yank a program that may be benefitting the child.    All in all, if I had to make a recommendation to a parent, my advice would be to hire a consultant only if money is no object and you have cash to spare for that plus the other services you want. If it\'s RDI vs. ABA, speech therapy, OT, etc., I would not recommend it. Yes, there are some useful points in the program, but I personally think you can get most of them from just reading the books.</div>'

'just so everybody knows.<br> <br> A<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> Fastpass</span> is a machine that is at the front gates of most of the \"popular\" rides and is available for everybody to use. You take your admission card to the Fastpass machine, put it in, and it spits out a ticket with a return time on it. You come BACK to the ride at the return time and show them your Fastpass ticket. They then put you in a seperate - much shorter line - than the standard standbye line .... and you get to ride. Again, Fastpasses are available to every disney guest and they are a way to let a computer stand in line for you.<br> <br> There is also a Special card available for people with Disabilities which is a completely different thing from the Fastpass. It would be best for you to take a letter from your Doctor, stating that a member of your party has a medical disability that makes it impossible for them to wait in a line with large crowds of people. Take this letter to Guest Services at one of the Main Parks (Epcot, MGM, Animal Kingdom, or The Magic Kingdom). They will then give you a card that you can use to avoid the large crowds and longer lines. Take your card to the Disney Employee standing at the front of the lines. They will then either let you into a special waiting area - or use the Fast Pass line. You will generally still have to wait some in line, but usually not nearly as long as you would in the \"regular\" line. This card will also allow you to use your Stroller as a wheelchair all over the Disney property, the rides, restaurants, gift shops etc. You can also use this card to get the Disney Employees to assist you in being seated at the edges of crowds instead of in the middle in the larger shows.<br> <br> This is a very popular message board that has a seperate forum about visiting Disney with disabilities. There are several parents with ASD kids here, as well as tons of other Disabilities.

If you had bad experiences with biomed why is it that you would come to the board for biomed other than to stir up trouble?

I for one never asked for Winnie to be the one asking questions for all us poor new parents to autism and biomed. Give people some credit for being able to read what someone posts and decide whether or not it applies to our situation or if we CHOOSE to believe what is being said!     As to your comment about the group homes what you do with your child is your business. I for one have NEVER stated that if you dont follow a certain path thats where your kid will end up and you should not make a sweeping statement that eveyone doing biomed successfully believes that.     Ask all the legitimate questions you need to but if you dont like the defensiveness then dont cause us to be defensive!</div>'

If preschoolers had such insight on what made them \"feel better\" -- and cooperated accordingly -- they would willingly eat their vegetables and refuse sugary snacks and Happy Meals.

' <div class=\"postbody\">A child will be qualified for ESY season (exended school year) based on needs. Not all students qualify. But they will tell you months ahead on your IEP meeing if your child is going to the half a day ESY program so that you have enough time to apply, request for that service if they say he won\'t be going to the ESY program. didn\'t you know that? I\'m sorry to tell you this, having 2 weeks left before school is out, i wonder if they will do anything right now. But i encourage you to talk to the program specialist as soon as possible and do all it requires to make him eligible for the ESY. If no luck, what you can do is ask his teacher around who will be available in summer. Not all the special ed teachers/aids will have a summer job, some are desparate to get extra income. In our county the ones hold masters in special ed will have priority, so teachers who are in school, or who hold certificate might have less chance to teach in ESY season, so they want to work. ( our aba therapist is also his teacher and she is in school, she isn\'t teaching this summer so she is asking around if anyone needs extra hours of aba) They charge anything from $15-$30 an hour. If push come to shove you can have atleast few hours of aba/vb a week. I don\'t know your financial situation, programs like summer social skills program, summer buddies, will help. Play groups, swimming class, may be adding a weekly speech therapy and ot will help filling the long day.

'<P>Thanks for answering my post. My GS has what is called a REPS Provider through the county mental health department. She is supposed to be somewhat like an aid however his teacher has asked that she not be present in the classroom because it disrupts the other children having an additional adult there just helping one child. My GS was placed with this particular teacher at the beginning of the school year last August because his Mental Health Counselor recommended her because she has delt with PDD/ADHD children in the past. The only connection I have ever heard the teacher mention is that her son is Bipolar. I don\'t know if she has any specific training in Autism. Also the REPS Provider only goes on a 3 month contract and then she is done unless there is an application for an extention. The provider was also supposed to help by coming into the home and observing my GS in is every day activities. She would come by for 20 or 30 minutes about avery 10days or so and play with him, but then say she had to go put her daughter to bed and she had to leave. Several times she would pick him up (sometimes alone and sometimes with a group of other children with an assortment of behavior problems) and take them to a movie or the park. After her 3 month contract was up we requested that it not be renewed because we couldn\'t see what benefit GS had gotten from it. The raps provider would say \"I\'ll call you tomorrow and let you know what time I\'ll be picking nick up.\" And we would wait around not making any plans and she would\'t call until a few days later, always with an \"excuse.\" She just wasn\'t working out. </P> <P>So this month, after the \"green wire\" episode at school everyone in the system decided to try GS with the same REPS provider again. Although his mom and I had reservations about this provider being used once again. She has been back in with up only 2 weeks now and is up to her old tricks again. I can\'t see that she has brought him any benefit, just aggravation for us wondering when she will show up. </P> <P>Also to my knowlege GS has never had an IEP . He will be finished with this school year next month. We have bought a house and it just happens to be in the school district that is at the bottom of performance reviews. I believe that under the No Child Left Behind Law because of that we can pick the school GS can go to but I\'m not clear if we have to provide transportation yet.

Did I say spit? I ment to. Oh he was a bolter also. And strong. I mean at 2 he could push a 50lb coffee table accross the room to get at things to destroy. He removed all the tile from my fireplace at 6 months of age. Oh ABA:-) <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /> That was the life saver. After 2 weeks he said his first word. \"milk\" After 6 months he had over 200 words. Sure He screamed his head off in there. But he screamed his head off anyway. At least he was getting the help he needed. He had 35 hours a week. He is awsome now!!!! He is 5 1/2 and he can read! We were able to unlock all the doors when he was 3! We were able to take down the 3 feet high cardboard fortress we had erected around the house!!!! We untied the chairs from the table! What I am trying to say is in my case I owe ABA big time. And sure it was rough but through the pain came awsome progress I do not think would have come any other way.

Shilo</div>    I know this is the education side ... so I\'ll make it short ...  At 2 1/2 mine was that way too ... except he wasn\'t trying to get out of the house just to get out ... he\'d want to stare at the children at play sign across the street and hence want to get out, and wasn\'t that bad a biter or spitter or a hair puller ... but yea head butting ... chin plowing yea ... screaming for everything and 100% non verbal ... NDF, B12 brought out language with no other therapy in that period, play therapy helped him keep his clothes on, school took some of the crazed running out ... but I suspect he does it 100 times worse at school and is tired at home, and Lupron took down the gritting and head butting out and the chin plowing too ... all in the last 6 months. He is 3 1/3rd right now. DMSA added to lupron seems to be doing very little, but time and testing will tell. May be time to do DMPS I think. But 2-3 rounds I\'ll probably have to persist.  Cool.

'I don\'t think anyone has ever told a poster to avoid doctors. Since the beginning of time people have sought answers from their peers and the internet is simply a much larger gathering of those peers. <br><br>Added to this, doctors are not all around experts. You choose between a general practitioner that has a mid-level knowledge of most conditions and a specialist that has a deep knowledge of a few conditions. If you are not sure who to go to, you get bounced around wasting time and money and some times you even wind up with bad information from a doctor that doesn\'t have the knowledge to diagnose what you suspect. This I know from personal experience as I spent 3 years being told nothing was wrong with my son so I completely disagree that a doctor\'s word is law. Had I used the internet more and used forums to seek advice, my son could be an astoundingly different person today and not struggle as much. I would not have spent 3 years in hell thinking I was a horrible parent who couldn\'t teach my child how to behave or say his abc\'s.<br><br>In the forum you have many people giving support and many parents (and cousins, people with autism and even a few people who work with asd professionally) who can point you to resources and share knowledge they have spent their time researching. Our resources here are not futile. I have received much help in this forum. <br><br>I think you\'re mostly referring to the rash post and those like it and if the parent thought her child was in need of urgent care, she would have taken him. It was a rash, there were no other symptoms. It\'s not an odd post.

' <div class=\"postbody\">My daughter is 7 now, but when she started mainstream preschool at 3yrs. old, she didn\'t talk much at all, she was a bit aggressive at the time, but I went on like nothing.  When the teachers confronted me on it, I then fought for her to stay there, because I felt how was she to learn HOW to act if she wasn\'t around typical kids?  So, they added an aid to the classroom and put her in a 4year old class.  With the older kids, if she did something inappropriate to them, they would talk back.  The 3year olds were too scared to do anything.  Then when she turned 4, I placed her in a universal prekindergarten through our school system.  She had WONDERFUL teachers and it was very structured, which is what she needed.  It was free play where she got into trouble.  She received OT and Speech right there.  She went every morning and absolutely loved it.  I\'m not saying it was all smooth sailing every day.  We definately had good and bad days, but so do typical 3 and 4 year olds!  I was always involved which always helps.  This school gave her love and patience, where as the first one she went to, I felt, couldn\'t and didn\'t give her what she needed.  It might take you a few different preschools to figure out a good connection.  If you do what is in your heart and your gut, and be fully involved in every way, then you make the right decisions.</div>'

'<P>Okay, My son doesn\'t use these but he did have some made for him, The generic pictures the schools use and if your child is in with a school therapist they could make you some. </P> <P>However, if you have digital camera, and a photo printer you can make your own PECS cards. All you do is take pictures of things that your child likes, foods,toys,tv,bath tub, bed, etc common items and print the pictures off, glue them to a piece of hard card stock(scrapbooking paper works) write in magic marker what the object is and laminate it. I have a HP PHOTOSMART 8450 PRINTER, got it at BestBuy, it has a layout format for all sizes of pictures, the size we use is snapshot size(a little larger than a wallet photo) the printer can print about 9 pictures on one sheet(different pics of course)the size works great. I think that actual photos work better because they are things your child sees and will recognize, you can also take pictures of your child eating and label it so and so eating, same for potty time, bath time. </P> <P>My son has a picture book called \"Adam\'s picture book\" he has his fav\'s in it such as his slide,swing,ball, elmo, fishtank, blues clues, crayons, etc.. He doesn\'t use PECS but he does look at this book all the time. If you need to make a schedule board you can use the same pictures, poster board, and velcro tape, one piece goes on the board and one goes on the picture. You can put an evenlope(big one) at the bottom to \"catch\" the pictures as you remove them from the board, or you can use your refridgerator and use magnet tape. It sounds like a pain but its actually a pretty fun project, if your child is using it. You may want to start out with the book first to see if your child will get in to it, or maybe a couple of pics on a smaller poster board for a routine board. Good Luck!!

You really helped me see how going in without an IEP would be worse for him.</P> <P>Unfortunately, I\'m not sure he\'ll be getting an IEP before August. We just completed a private eval. and have been told by the school that they are no longer staffing for IEPs until October. I\'m not completely panicking yet- I have an advocate. The school is willing to work with us and pick a teacher that he could remain with once the IEP is put in place as well as inform his teacher ahead of time about him.</P> <P>We have decided to have him enter 1st with an IEP (hopefully) in his home school. If I don\'t do this, I\'ll forever wonder how he would have done at his home school. If things go poorly after 1st grade, we are considering the Mckay scholarship and having him go to a private school, maybe one for kids on the spectrum. </P> <P>This has posed even more debate at home- what is the best path for children on the spectrum?- to be schooled with as many opportunities to be with \"neuro-typicals\" or to be placed in special schools with other high-functioning asd children?</P> <P>I\'ve been reading tons of books, talking to everyone I can. Every professional involved with my son has a different opinion- and they all have their good points! </P> <P>This is one of the hardest things for us right now- I know every child is different, but it is so hard to deal with the fact that not even the professionals can agree on what is best to help him grow up to lead a life where he can be independent and self-sufficient.</P> <P>Once again, thank you everyone for replying.</P>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi, I also have identical twin girs who are 32 months and both have Autism.  They have some nasty smelling stools too, but honestly I think ours was from bacteria and/or yeast and now they smell like metals from chelating.      We have been gfcf for 10 months and on many supps and MB12 also.  One of my girls has had GI bacteria issues so I would check for that because it could be causing the foul odor.  Also yeast smells bad (during die off especially), but I have also heard others say it smells like bread - yeasty.      If it is an intermittant thing, it could be viruses especially since it seems to sting their bottom and redden it quickly, but if it is a regular occurance, it is probably a different problem.    We love \"poop mysteries\" on this board so I am sure there will be other responses!  Good Luck with your twins!  Kim</div>'

VSL probiotic is supposed to have the bacteria to degrade oxalates and I think that group uses it in their yogurt even.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Yeppers - and there is no way you can just learn it all in one sitting. Doing an ABA program justs takes time - time to take it in daily and time to generalize it.  It seems to take a lot of conversations also between me and our consultants for me to really get what\'s going on.     We\'ve been doing a program since November. We didn\'t really take off w/ it until February, but it has helped him so much I can\'t believe it. Time seems to go slowly, and each day can seem like there\'s no progress, but over a period of months there is a lot.     They help you, too, through those difficult situations - and you can\'t predict them, that will continue to occur. We have monthly meetings where they ask me what problems we\'re having at the present, and then we work on those. So, we just take it as it comes.     One important thing is DATA. W/o good data, you can\'t run a program. I feel our program\'s strength is the data we take and that the therapists share among each other. Our first program was horrible and that\'s why we switched providers.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Joey, 6 yrs., PDD-NOS  GFCF, Yasko, RDI  Did ABA for 14 mos.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Joey, 6 yrs., PDD-NOS  GFCF, Yasko, RDI  Did ABA for 14 mos.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thank you all for the comments.      Winnie, were those hours actual Lovaas-style ABA hours?  Or a mixture of different therapies?  And by different therapies, I don\'t just mean other styles of ABA, but OT or ST or PT, etc.?    Jennifer, it\'s my <em>guess </em>that the 25 hour thing came from the congressional report, the Educating Children with Autism one.  My kiddo\'s neurologist was on that committee.  It\'s funny, though, because when I called the office to ask some questions about the report, all I could get was an office staff  member telling me how great segregated, autism-specific special ed classes were, and how those 25 hours could just be in broad-spectrum special ed.  This seemed incongruous with me to the therapies recommended in the congressional report.  My neurologist works closely with the school districts.  This makes me suspicious.    I hear you about 40 hours of anything being a bit much, but what changed my opinion of that was a comment in the independent psych evaluation we had done by a doctor I adore and trust completely.  She said that without 40 hours, much time is spent... and I cannot remember the wording she used... but it meant something like outside of therapy, he\'s in his own world, and not learning or growing.  So I started watching him and indeed he would stim like crazy out of therapy, but be fine during therapy, and that included other types of therapy, not just ABA.      That\'s what makes me wonder if other therapies would be OK to use, despite the 40 hour gold standard.  If he\'s interacting, focused, targeted, does the therapy, or even just the moment in time, become equivalent to Lovaas-style ABA in its benefit?  If he\'s totally focused on his OT session, using language beautifully and trying to achieve whatever objective, how is that less beneficial than a table-based ABA session?  Or for that matter, making cookies with me or something, if he\'s totally into it?  This is what\'s keeping me up at night.  The quality of therapy in that 40 hours has to have something to do with success, not just the number.  Is there something organic in well-performed ABA therapy that makes it inherently better?    ETA Irene and LM, we were posting at the same time.  I appreciate the additional info.  Irene, I do remember that from the study... how interesting...    LM, that quote you cited is quite interesting.  We recently had a home organizer go through our house, and as a result we \"purged\" about 30 garbage bags full of whatever stuff (toys, clothes, etc.) and gave it all to charity.  The result has been really interesting.  With less c--- in the house, my kids are calmer and play longer with the toys they do have.  All that $$$ and STUFF was actually getting in the way.</div>      <span class=\"gensmall\">Last edited by <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8&amp;sid=a2dede0d84462d4ad009c59d5504a8bb\">MCA</a> on Thu Aug 10, 2006 10:19 am, edited 2 times in total.</span>'

What was absoultely invaluable was having speech built into the program</div>.       That was our experience as well. Technically he had/has 30 minutes twice a week, through school, but especially in the earlier stages when he didn\'t have any language this was a ridiculously small amount. But we pushed language throughout the day, both in therapy and in the natural environment- there were no \"freebies\", every time he wanted something he had to make an attempt to communicate. We wouldn\'t ask for anything unreasonable, the expectations were always on the cusp of the next skill above what he had- so for example when he was 100% nonverbal, all he had to do was look and point, then one syllable (sp?), then a word approximation, then a word, 2 words etc. All this, all the time every day. And once he was at a certain stage, say 2 word requests for example, we wouldn\'t allow him to \"get away\" with an earlier stage (like 1 word). The key was to make it all worth his while, so he was being reinforced like a king, for good talking. I found that for my son only working on speech 24/7 across all environments would help.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ \"When many cures are offered for a disease, it means the disease is not curable\" -Anton Chekhov</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ \"When many cures are offered for a disease, it means the disease is not curable\" -Anton Chekhov</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">This is how I view it; however this is only my opinion so please, I don\'t want anyone to get upset.  I view my daughter as high functioning autism.  What I mean by this is that she goes to a typical school, she can read, write, talk, swim, etc....  She is delayed in all areas, but she is able to tell me what she needs, she is able to participate in all activities, she doesn\'t throw temper tantrums, she doesn\'t hit herself, etc...  She can &quot;pass&quot; for typical, but there are many many times she stands out.   When I tell people she has autism, they just look at me.  I don\'t know what they think autism is, but they don\'t think it\'s her.  I wish there could be a movie portraying autism as some of our kids are so the world could see it doesn\'t have to be devestating.  What I can tell you is that it is still hard to be a mother of a high functioning autistic child in the fact that sometimes you can feel like... good, we\'re ok, and be all happy, then something happens and BAM you are reminded that you are not typical and it\'s thrown right in your face.  It\'s hard to come back from those lows.  I love my baby girl and she has taught me the true meaning of life.  I am grateful for every inch she progresses which goes unnoticed with typical children; and I have a typical son.  I\'m worried about what will happen to her when she becomes an adult, but I have to take one day at a time.  That\'s it.  Hope this helped.  Dee\'s mom</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">At about the 15th session or so:    I brought my son to my parents\' place and we started HBOT on the 23rd of October. Since then we\'ve missed about 3 sessions, so I guess we\'ve completed 14 sessions.      Improvements:     1. Much more imitation.     2. Playing \"so big\".    3. More gestures. Shaking his head. Touching both his hands to his head when he sees someone. I think it\'s his way of saying hello. He learnt 2 new gestures in just 1 hour. That too from playing with someone across the room. No one was trying to teach him &gt; he saw that guy shake his head, so he shook his head.    4. Learning things very fast. I showed him a picture book and pointed at a circle 4-5 times and then I asked him where the circle was. He patted the circle figure pretty consistently.    5. For the first time yesterday,he tried to point. He lifted his hand up at the light and the fan when I asked him where they were.    6. I\'m not sure, but I think he\'s slightly easier to put to sleep now. The quality of his sleep hasn\'t improved however.    7. He had a jealous fit when he saw me playing with the household help\'s daughter. He started hitting the girl who was carrying him. This is not a good thing no doubt, but it is certainly instinctive behaviour for a 1 year old.    8. The most important thing is that he\'s gesturing spontaneously and looking at us for approval.    9. Has always played ball, but now plays in a very appropriate turn taking way and for a long time without losing patience.    I think that\'s it for now. As I\'ve already mentioned in another post <a href=\"http://www.autismweb.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8653\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.autismweb.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8653</a>, I\'ve also seen increased aggression and lots of very irritable behaviour.

'<P>I personally think 5 is on the early side for any kind of hand writing expectations. I went through this with both my sons - 1 PDD-NOS and 1 typical. AJ had OT for a couple of years before he started to write but we believe that helping him climb a lot to develope his arm muscles really helped(both of them). Pencil grips and big fat pencils also helped. Handwriting Without Tears is a great program. We also used a slantboard and installed 2 white boards in our house. The angle is great for arm development and gives you plently of opportunities to practice all the time - drawing, numbers and letters. Both my boys became successful writers half way through kindergarten. Montessori materials have \"sand paper letters\" that are part of the hand writing process - we did not use them but I have heard they are helpful.

The other likes to swing or takes off to look at the pond.  I usually try other trips when my husband can come.  I think they have to learn how to be in public eventually.  It is draining! I truely understand the rollercoaster of emotion.  One week I think my boys will be OK . The next week I don\'t know how they are going to make up the deficits.  I am questioning everything I do.  Supplements and GFCF diet Does it really make a difference? ABA? Sometimes I don\'t know how much more I can take. I often wonder if I will ever be able to relax and watch my boys have fun on their own.  I guess when they make it through this hardship it will be like i won the superbowl!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">My therapists seem to approach Aidan\'s compliance, behaviors and control issues from a less stringent model. Basically, they take into effect what is considered developmentally appropriate for his age, and they do analyze why he isn\'t complying but when determining what to do a lot goes into the decision. Sometimes they step back and change their own style of how they are presenting something, keeping him interested or motivated - does he need some more sensory, gross motor breaks, excitement etc. Soemtimes they feel like we need to work through it but it is always in very small manageable steps. So sometimes if Aidan doesn\'t seem to be cooperating we may tell him he needs to stick with it 1 or 2 more times and then we really praise him and then he gets to make a choice about what we do next. Or, sometimes we feel like a better approach is to teach him a better way of expressing what he wants. So if he can lower his voice and ask nicely using a 2-3 word request - then he can have his request. I\'m just happy with it because each time a decision is made it seems to be made with Aidan the whole child in mind. I don\'t know if that makes sense. It seems, that my therapists and consultant are very flexible about Aidan\'s program because they are in no way strict traditionalist ABA people. they definately appreciate ABA as a powerful and effective way of teaching many things but they do not at all look at everything from only that perspective. They see the bones of ABA as a great way to outline a program but then the actual program we run is filled in with many things that are tailor designed to suit Aidan. </div>    Sounds like you have some very awesome and professional therapists, who thoughtfully take the child\'s behavior into consideration, and adjust their program accordingly. This is how I wish our program could have been, but ours were strict with no bending.

Do you know if there is a long waiting list to just get an aba therapist to work with you, even if you are initially willing to pay them on your own? Where I am going with this is if I start paying initially (hopefully not too long before I get into real debt!) for these ABA therapist services, and then work in parallel with my insurance company to get reimbursement. But I am just wondering if there is a long waiting list just to get an ABA therapist to work for you, because of lack of availability.</P> <P>J&amp;J Mom- Are you presently using ABA services for your kids?

'<P>I forget now how old your son is. If he is at the age of MANDATORY school attendance, send him back to school IMMEDIATELY. If you have him out of school for more than 10 days (this may vary from state to state, but ALL states have truancy laws), the school can (and probably will) call CPS. You will have CPS all over you and you may have to hire a lawyer. Personally, I think the school district purposely tried to keep the mediator from coming by canceling the meeting date. Do not let them trick you into getting into truancy issues so that they can further punish you and, through you, your son. This is SERIOUS. I belong to a lawyer/advocate message board and they\'ve posted that this can and does happen. If your son is below mandatory age, they can\'t do this. But there may be parents reading this post whose kids are older and might need this info. </P> <P>Get your boy back into school asap anyway, because a hearing officer will otherwise see you as an uncooperative parent. Put EVERYTHING in writing. Good luck.</P>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Our son was just recently diagnosed with autism.  We have been reading some books we bought and doing some research about the GFCF diet, but we have some concerns.  Our son was also diagnosed with a sensory disorder and does eat many foods and will not try new foods.  He also will not eat meat or veggies, he mostly eats bread and bread/flour products. Has anyone else had a child with this and put them on the GFCF diet?  What were your results?   We are worried that he will reject the GF foods......</div>'

What if he is happy with the way things are right now? There are a lot of things he would be better to not know anything about. His lack of connection to the real world protects him against the dangers of life. There are a lot of things I wish I never knew about.    Also too many things to choose from would make him frustrated, and having to balance his interests, thus limiting his joy in the special interests. Then it would be better to let him be without knowledge, and protect him from the horrible reality of the world.    Let people live in a dreamworld, and they become happy!</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Yes, thank you for sharing this!!  Yes, actually, I am familiar with the protocol--but have never done it.  I studied up on this a bit years ago when I was exploring the possibility that lyme was the cause of my son\'s autism and my family\'s health problems--it seemed a good fit since we were all sick in some way.  But then I figured out some things about mold, and went off in that direction.  I didn\'t really get on the parasite bandwagon until about a year ago, and never thought about his again.  It is exactly what I need!  It makes so much sense, really.  And a good thing that I can try on myself before I try on my kids.    It is so interesting you should post this now.  I had a HUGE die-off event this last weekend, and I had just decided that it was because I have been, for the last week, taking epsom salts baths again, plus oral magnesium for sleep, plus a glass of baking soda water to calm my very, very acidic stomach at night, plus two days of vermox.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" /> Didn\'t do it on purpose, it just shook out this way.  I got hugely puffy, like an allergic reaction or like my body was full of toxins or an infection.  I also had a BAD headache and felt almost crazy--huge fight with hubby, and then went to bed and slept for the day.  Just a mess.  The puffiness is subsiding.  I thought magnesium overdose, but now that you post this, I am wondering if this was parasite die-off due to the huge amount of salt I ingested with the treatments above, plus vermox on top of it all.    And if that\'s true, I really hate to think what it means.    Yeah--the CDC calling anybody a fraud is crazy.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

We had been on a new yeast med, Intracogizol (sp.?) and he told me to discard it, see how she is next week. It is rough here right now.

'Hey Guys My name Is Brandy Phillips. I just feel so lost. My son was diagnosed with aspergher syndrome when he was four. He is now ten and he got retested and the test came back inconclusive. My son is a great kid. He has no friends but all he wants to do is learn. He is so smart. Straight A. Student just no friends. He would rather learn they be outside. He has outbrts when he doesn\'t know what you want from him. We have been told consitency is the key. That just doesn\'t work when everyday is a new day. I wake up not knowing if this is the day he will actually go outside or the day he will ignore me and stay in his room. The one thing I love about him is how smart he is you can talk to him in about a dozen different subjects and he can talk to you about each one. I learn more from him than I ever did in school. I am so glad I found this sight. I don\'t feel so lost anymore.'

'<P>He should definiely be mainstreamed. My son is PDD-NOS, he didn\'t say ma-ma until 18 months, nor did he walk until then. Hedidn\'t speak 3-4 word sentences until he was 3+. We put him in a developmental pre-k class when he was 4, but we felt it didn\'t help him. We enrolled him in public school when it was time for kindergarten. He didn\'t speak or socialize well, he had boundary issues, (going from room to room). He had frequent temper tantrums at first, but each time he was promoted, he socialized better and his speech improved rapidly, (he was receiving speech therapy, and did until last year when by my wife and I and the therapist that he no longer needed it). My son came to realize that to get what he wanted he needed to talk. He still gets occupational therapy for his fine motor skills. My son will be 13 this summer and he\'s doing great. By the way I forgot to mention that in class he has a paraprofessional who works with him in class and she and even his classmates help him stay focused. Sometimes his attention drifts. He has many friends who he enjoys playing with. He\'s doing very well, he makes us proud. Mainstreaming, GO FOR IT.</P> <P> </P> <P> </P>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Oral B vitamins flare up yeast a lot for kids, like mine. We can only do the B12 nasal spray, and behind scd and Oxytocin, these have been our miracles, all within the last 6 months. My son has battled clostridia for well over a year. When his Oat test is normal, he is as NORMAL as he ever is! I mean just amazing. Here are his signs that clostridia is back: pinching, biting lip in frustration, saying silly things, random laughing, and not as good at school. Also adding \"t\'s\" on the ends of words. When this happens, we get the Oat test and clostridia is back. The only thing that keeps it away for us is Vanco. I have tried all naturals, and every other thing, and this wipes it out within  2 weeks, and he is back, and always better than ever. So now what we do is a small amount of vanco in the am and pm to keep it at bay. It is not long term, but it works. Clostridia is bad stuff, and it really takes a toll on my son. Jeni B is right, diet is our key to it coming back. We were strict SCD for a while, now we are on a rotation diet. Lots of veggies, chicken, fruits, and I also rotate some gf/cf items which works well and gives him more choices. The three times it came back I gave him a few \"extra\" snacks, all gf/cf but he just can\'t handle it. My doc says my son can\'t handle the artificial colors and dyes in the foods. So those snacks are given only sparingly, or on a special occassion.  For us it is the sugars, but not from fruit that bring it back.    I get mine componded, and a bottle is 80.00 with insurance. Mine is from Park pharmacy in Irvine, CA. I know they would never charge a lot for someone who has no insurance coverage, so they might be worth trying.    Hope this helps.     Tanya</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Talking \'bout aspies,      I am an aspie, myself, actually.  99.9% sure.  I\'ve got a family, a husband who I love <em>even though I want to chuck him out the window most the time</em>, I\'ve held down professional level jobs in my pre-mommy days and excelled at them.  I am just known as a little \"off\" by my friends, colleagues, and neighbors, which is embarrassing, but OK with me.  And I know when I am having a sensory overload moment and can take appropriate precautions to make sure no one needs me for a little while while I turn out the lights, put a cold cloth on my head, pop a pill (unfortunately) and wait for the world (and my brain) to mellow out again.    The difference is due to the difference between girls and boys on the spectrum, I think.  Girls on the spectrum, because of their socialization, learn to understand and navigate the social world better - not as participants but almost as sociologists.  I also think that girls on the spectrum tend to over-fixate on <em>people </em>as their obsession rather than <em>objects </em>like the boys do.  I remember studying girls\' magazines voraciously to figure out how to dress and act.  Therefore we learn how to \"act normal\" and end up doing OK, albeit kind of lonely sometimes.    hope this can encourage someone with a spectrum girl  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />      Debbie</div>'

We didn\'t have that before. That\'s what I\'m happy about, but I just can\'t be allowed to have any happiness over it . ..we\'ve always got to be concerned about something that isn\'t perfect.    And I know it\'sher way of always making sure we\'re moving forward, but it\'s tough emotionally on a parent.    Here is something he\'s done recently . . he found a stick on the ground that was in the shape of a Y.  A perfect Y. He noticed it, picked it up and said, Look, Mommy, it\'s a Y!!     I mean, that is just awesome as far as I\'m concerned for any 5 year old. He recognizes it - yes, maybe he writes it backwards, but he recognizes it frontwards.  And he also mentioned he has a Y in his name - fantastic.    And the speech artic as well. I mean, I got chewed for 20 mins because he still \"can\'t even say his name right.\" Well, the \"J\" sound - I\'m not even sure if it\'s a 5 year old sound yet. The school and the docs are telling us not to worry, that artic can be addressed in due time.  His language continues to blossom, and his thought processes we can just see are very much getting sharper, it\'s just the artic that continues to be a problem.     Don\'t get me wrong - our ABA folks are dedicated, organized, and they know their ABA stuff ...but I\'m not sure they\'re entirely accurate about basic child development and/or speech pathology.

Since I do not know you, your family, or your child personally, I hesitate to write a Social Story for you, as it would be similar to me making a pair of shoes for all the members of your family with the information I currently have about them. So, I am going to &#147;brainstorm&#148; on paper for you, and I would like you to view it as a personal &#147;shoe store&#148; so to speak: I don&#146;t want or expect you to cheer at every idea, but I hope I can suggest a few ideas that strike you as a good &#147;fit&#148;. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Recently, I consulted with a professional who was working on behalf of a mother who was terminally ill, who needed ideas to explain her own passing to her two young boys with autism. Here&#146;s what the two of us came up with: </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Create one/two <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #ffff66\">memory</B> boxes. In an effort to provide both parties with some control over the situation, encourage them to write letters or create <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #ffff66\">memory</B> boxes. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>If she is able and willing, Grandma can write and reflect or dictate to others her thoughts about your child, and perhaps use photographs to help recall those special times. These can be short letters delivered to your child by you when you return home. You can also deliver to her short letters that your child writes. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>When you are out of town, perhaps your child&#146;s caregiver can work with him to add to a <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #a0ffff\">box</B> where he collects photos, thoughts, videos, etc. of his experiences with Great Grandma. This doesn&#146;t have to take a large amount of time, in fact, the opposite. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Then, when you return, you can share a few thoughts about your visit, and your child has an important reciprocal role, to share what he has added to Great Grandma&#146;s great memories <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #a0ffff\">box</B>. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>I know Grandma is still alive, but the <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #a0ffff\">box</B> can begin an important transition. Recalling important times is important for all people &#150; which is why photo albums are so important. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Keep in mind the <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #ffff66\">memory</B> <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #a0ffff\">box</B> or scrapbook does not need to be presented in the light that Great Grandma may pass away; only that you are going to visit her to help her, and he can help you and the family feel better by collecting wonderful thoughts at home.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>A Social Story could describe the project to your child and its importance. I&#146;ve written a sample Story for you: </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>My name is Kyle. Lately, Mom has been going to New York to help Great Grandma. She will visit with her and help her in many ways. This is a list of things my mom did the last time she went to help Great Grandma: ....[include a list] It&#146;s important to help people in my family when they are feeling bad or sad. By looking at the calendar in this story, I can tell that mom will be gone for three days, beginning in the morning on Saturday. She is planning to return home in a plane on Sunday. Mom says that I may help, too. When mom is gone helping Great Grandma, I can help, too. I can try to collect pictures or things that we do with Great Grandma. I may have some things that I remember and can write (or record, or dictate). Thinking nice things about Great Grandma can help everyone. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>The <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #a0ffff\">box</B> or scrapbook that is developed before the funeral, can be added to after the funeral. Also, if Grandma is able to write a letter to your child when you visit, this can start the brief discussion of your visit that I mentioned earlier, and placed in the <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #ffff66\">memory</B> <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #a0ffff\">box</B>/scrapbook. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Dr. Tony Attwood has shared that a child with autism may not experience the same emotions as the rest of the family, and that&#146;s okay. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Depending upon several factors, your child may emotionally process the loss of Great Grandma differently than you or others in your family. That may mean that he seems less, or more, upset than everyone else. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>At the extremes, for some children the passing of a family member may result in minimal expression of feelings and a factual explanation. With some children, my experience has been that death is the &#147;ultimate change&#148;, not solely the loss of a loved one, but much more. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>The point that Tony makes, if I am speaking for him accurately, is that it&#146;s best to follow the child&#146;s lead on this one, versus trying to prepare him for a traditional emotional response that he may not experience or understand. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>What makes this so difficult for the adults involved is the emotional status of the rest of the family at this time.

' <div class=\"postbody\">One thing I\'m wondering about these very late regressors (like in Crystal\'s and respect\'s posts) - maybe they had developed some kind of encephalopathy that resulted in behaviors one can also see with autism. Remember, there is no one \"test\" to diagnose autism, and ultimately it\'s really a behavioral diagnosis. Other things can mimic it too. You can probably find autistic-like behaviors in many other psych/neuro conditions. I personally have an older family member who ended up bed ridden, and with multiple strokes, and she now withdraws herself from everybody, and only talks about 2 topics and only in the same way- many things she does remind me of Alex\'s quirks at one time or another. Also in teen years, I would really start to worry about schizophrenia etc. Not saying the vaccines those guys received didn\'t affect them, just wondering how accurate would an autism label be on a teenager with previously completely normal functioning, when this is a condition where by definition (DSM) the problems needs to have occured by the age of 3.  Alex\'s mom</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Regarding the blabbing, there is another dimension to the blabbing.  They not only blab (and blab inaccurately) away from us, they blab (and blab inaccurately) <em>in front of us</em>.    I used to give talks for mostly staff in which I would rattle off a paragraph or two full of word for word (or slightly paraphrased for privacy) things staff said about other disabled people, <em>in front of me</em>, because they assumed that I either could not hear them, could not (or would never) understand what they were saying, or would never repeat what they were saying.    I told them if they didn\'t want their words repeated at a talk someone gives later in life, to be careful what they said.    It tended to leave a lasting impression, considering it contained confidential information about dozens of people, as well as staff descriptions of how they felt about the assorted people (including me) and about their own uninformed speculations about people\'s \"real problems\" as opposed to whatever the person had been diagnosed with.      Favorites in the speculation department were saying that someone was not autistic if they showed the slightest sign of awareness other people existed (or similar misconceptions for other diagnoses, I just remember this <em>very obviously</em> autistic kid who was always getting called non-autistic by them because he grabbed people by the hand and led them places), and saying that nearly anything anyone did was designed to be game-playing or attention-seeking or some other thing that made staff the center of the world.      In my case I also got to hear rampant speculation about how I got how I was, and whether there was any point to \"treating\" me and why they got stuck with me taking up space when they couldn\'t \"do anything\" for me, lots of speculation about whether I could understand them or not, whether I was brain-damaged from a whole array of sources, and then the usual as described above.    If you ever want to hear exactly what staff in those settings thinks of someone, be a client.  They won\'t bother to find you important or comprehending enough to shut up and be polite around.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Sure. Almost any antioxidant will help.

The entire link may offer some help.    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">http://www.alternativementalhealth.com/articles/walshMP.htm Elevated histamine and/or elevated basophils indicate undermethylation. Review of symptoms and medical history can bolster the diagnosis. For example, most undermethylated persons exhibit seasonal allergies, perfectionism, strong wills, slenderness, OCD tendencies, high libido, etc.  Conditions associated with undermethylation: Anorexia, Bulemia, shopping/gambling disorders, depression, schizo-affective disorder, delusions, oppositional-defiant disorder, OCD.  One thing that is absolutely certain is that methionine and/or SAMe usually harm low-histamine (overmethylated persons)..... but are wonderful for high-histamine (undermethylated) persons. The reverse in true for histadelic (undermethylated) persons, who thrive on methionine, SAMe, Ca and Mg..... but get much worse if they take folates &amp; B-12 which can increase methyl trapping.</div></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Tami</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Tami</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I waited until my son was almost 10 to do B12--we did not have a good DAN doctor, and she was trying other things (I don\'t think she was up to speed on B12.)  So I will echo Greg.  Do them NOW!!! Do not wait!  I feel like we lost two years of potential development.  I could kick myself for not pushing for these earlier, and cry inside for what the last years could have been for my son.  I feel B12 was our biggest, most consistent wow next to the early stages of dietary intervention.      We do nasal B12, by the way, as my son is older, and almost recovered, and we had concerns about modesty issues.  If they had not worked so well, we would have gone to shots.  But we are fine with the nasal.    I would AT LEAST try the nasal, if you are really afraid.  But the shots are a much better bet.  Think of the potential gains!!

I never once referred to that question, ( I will give 75%  more at bedtime and 25% more for the first morning dose, to allow her to get  at least 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep). No I did not ask that, say to do that or anything of that nature. I said if I ACCIDENTLY miss ONE night dose I will keep going. When a child goes to school and you get one chance a week to do a round, I\'m not going to do nothing because I missed the 3am dose FRIDAY night, whole weekend down the drain, no round. I say no, just keep going on from there. Andy may not agree with that, but that is what I do (PERSONALLY).  I said a round DOES NOT HAVE TO BE 64 TO 78 HOURS That is what I have said more than once.</div>  You can\'t quote me from 11 years ago in a situation that was specific suggestions to an individual in an uusual situation as to how to make the best of the bad choices available to her, ignoring the many thousands of posts I\'ve made in between saying most people should NOT do that, and pretend it is an accurate representation of my views.  I do not recall any correspondence with CheriO.  I hear from a LOT of people so it may wel have happened, but I do not believe I wouild have failed to remember it if I made any suggestion that skipping the night doses was OK.    Your basic choices are:  you actually want your kid to get better, so you chelate them properly no matter what it takes; or  you don\'t care if your kid gets better, you just want to feel like you\'re trying, so you do whatever is convenient.  How to do it properly (roughly 3 day cycles, no missed doses, no substantial dosage variation, stop if you miss one) is well understood and has been clearly stated by many in this thread.  If you are having trouble with this, you need to stop chelating and spend some time thinking through the balance of your needs and your child\'s needs until you can figure out how to get yours satisfied AND also take care of his.  He needs to be chelated properly.  You have to do it - properly - but that doesn\'t mean it has to be unpleasant, difficult, or interfere with what you want to get out of life.  In the meantime, don\'t hurt other people\'s kids by pretending what you are doing is all right and encouraging them to chelate improperly.  Most mommies care enough about their kids to do whatever it takes to get them better, all they really need is good information.  They don\'t have to spend tens of thousands of dollars on DAN! doctors.  They don\'t have to have an affair with the doctor if they can\'t come up with the money.  They don\'t have to do anything expensive, immoral, or even particularly difficult.  They just have to get up for a few minutes at night a few times a week and do something that isn\'t any more difficult than going to the bathroom.  Most mothers of autisitc children wake up and go to the bathroom more times per week than they need to wake up to chelate the kid.  BTW, I have never said there was a problem with transdermal chelation as long as it was given adequately frequently - smearing it on the skin instead of swallowing it doesn\'t change the basic laws of nature regarding what the chelators do in your kid\'s body - you still have to give it every 3-4 hours (for DMSA or ALA).  Transdermal use however does make nighttime dosing even easier.

'<P>I am sorry to hear that. Personally, I don\'t think that this is something else.</P> <P> My parents split when I was 11, I did not have any special needs but my father(at the time) felt like I choose my mother over him(did not know that then) and he would not have anything to do with me. I became an very angry individual. I took it out on my mom. I blamed her even when deep down I knew it was not her fault. Have you ever heard that people take things out on the people they love the most. Know Why? Because, they know that those people will still be there in the morning and still love you no matter what you do. You have always been there for your son and he knows you will be there. </P> <P>When I was young, 12-13 I was still angry and I thought about killing myself several times but I had no real intention. I just thought if I did then nobody would have to worry about me (my mom) and I thought I was a waste, If my own Dad didnt care about me then I must be worthless. I can imagine it would be worse for a boy. We all want our parents approval. My Mom made excuses for my Dad for a while but finally she just told me the truth.(which at first I refused to believe). I had to see it for myself. The truth was he was drinking very heavily and really at that point did not care about anone or anything. It wasnt me, it was the drinking. </P> <P>She tried to save me that pain. In reality she should have gave it to me striaght the first time. I understand why she did just realize that I was going to have to face it anyway.</P> <P>Your son is angry, he\'s been abondaned(in his mind) by his father and he probably is blaming it on you out loud but inside he is blaming himself and his probelms, most likely because he believes that the things he has wrong with him drove his father away.</P> <P>Back down to earth, Tell your son the truth no matter how painful. If your x told you he was too busy. Then just tell him the truth.</P> <P>Exactly what is the truth? Think about it. Is your x just tired of it all? (dealing with your childs disabilities) Or is it something else entirely? (drugs, drinking, another woman,etc.) Do you really know? If you are unsure, Find out! Your son wants an answer. He wont like the answer he gets I am sure but he has to know.</P> <P>Does your XH know what his son said and why he is in the hospital? If he does and does not care, then just let him go. I would think the only thing he could do for your son is hurt him more. I would tell him how important it is for him to be more involved with his son, If he wont, there is nothing you can do about that.</P> <P>A word to the wise. From experience, I can tell you there is not a drug on the market to stop the pain in someones heart when they lose someone they love. Whether it be by death, divorce, or the person they love just gradually disappears from their life. No Drug on this earth can stop the pain your heart feels. I am sure your heart is still feeling pain. I hate the way things have turned out for you and your family. I wish there was something I could do, but there isn\'t.</P> <P>I can tell you this. Until your son knows the truth about Why wont his father return his calls or emails and why doesnt his father come and see him more often, stuf like that. He will continue to blame hisself and take it out on you and yes you get some of the blame too. His fahter is not there for him to be angry with, You are. Whatever the case may be, Ask the father the questions the son wants to know, I would insist that his father go to the mental hospital and tell him why. Hurtful or not. It is probably safer for your son to find out what he needs to know to move on in life in the MH than at home. I would guess that he will rage. I did looking back. Things were different then than they are now. Its only natural to be angry. Disabled or Not. I dont know a single person, child or adult, that did not get very upset when their parents split. It is hard on anyone.</P> <P>Also, take a little time and be good to yourself. You only done what was right for your son and it is NOT your fault things are going the way they are now. Don\'t blame yourself. You have other people doing that for you. Just take it a day at a time and just tell your son the truth. He will get mad. Maybe at you first. But, He has to know the truth whatever that truth might be. If he was doing fine before the split and since the split he has gotten worse. I think it would be safe to assume that the split is causing whatever he is going through. I would try to address his feelings while in the hospital and try to get you H to come to the hospital and talk to his son. They have visiting hours after work. If not I am sure the hospital social worker would be able to arrange a meeting.</P> <P>I know my post really does not help much but it touched my heart when I read it and I had to share with you.</P> <P>I carried anger in my heart for my father until 7 years ago when I forgave him for not being a father and we finally started talking again. The pain and anger is finally gone. When I was younger, I was angry and bitter for a couple of years but then again I didnt have a shoulder to cry on or lean on. So I buried those things way down and moved on with my life. I also realized it didnt matter if anybody else cared about me or my life. What really mattered is what I thought about myself and my life. I also(as a kid) decided they were not going to get what they wanted which at the time I felt like it was for me to disappear or die so they would not have to deal with me anymore. I decided I would do better than anyone ever said I could and I would not let bad things hold me down. And I didnt.</P> <P>Things will get better. Once you hit rock bottom there is nowhere to go but up. From your post it sounds to me as if you feel you have hit rock bottom.</P> <P>Chin Up! All of us here will support you and your son the best we can.</P> <P>My heart goes out to you and your son.</P> <P>Venus</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Venus</div>'

'Hi Linda!<br> I\'ve been away for awhile as well. I am sorry your daughter has been afflicted with schizophrenia. I know how heartbreaking that can be. My mother has the same thing. I was told that in her case it will only get worse as she gets older. My parents divorced and I was raised by my dad. When I was of age I began to visit her again and took over the role of being her caregiver. It didnot go well. Now I remain her caregiver but from a distance. She lives about 2 1/2 hours away from me but I am her only family contact. It is hard for my sisters to understand her mental illness.....so they don\'t have much to do with her.

'<font size=\"2\"> <br />OK I haven\'t written in a long time, so I thought I\'d throw something out there. This concerns the \"myth\" that people with autism don\'t like to be touched, hugged, or held. I have dealt with this subject before, but I want to include it in my composite link so I\'m posting it here. <br /> <br />This is my favorite myth of all, so I\'ll go after it before any others. But it is only my take and that\'s all, so here goes..... <br /> <br />The touch issue, to a large degree, is one of those things that is actually independent of autism. Some people like touching more than others. And that transcends all neurological conditions. However, because of the sensory issues and predictability requirements associated with autism, sometimes it can appear that an autistic child dislikes being hugged or held simply because they resist it on the first try. <br /> <br />So why then, would an autistic child resist physical contact when he actually wants or enjoys it? <br /> <br />Well, it goes back to keeping one\'s bearings and having all sensory inputs in order. Most adults, particularly parents, aunts, uncles, etc., will run up and hug their son/daughter, neice/nephew, grandson/granddaughter, etc. as soon as they see the child, often uttering loud, obnoxious (but loving) gibberish in the process. Unless the child is completely familiar with this response by that particular person, and has been adequately warned that he is about to encounter this person, this sudden rush of sensory input is going to scare the crap out of him because he didn\'t see it coming. The child may love aunt Bessie to pieces, and would happily curl up in her lap if she asks him to, but when she suddenly runs up on him talking baby talk and snatching him up to hug him, he will wince out of reflex, not because he doesn\'t love her and doesn\'t want to hug her, but because he has not had a chance to prepare for these new visual, physical, and auditory sensations. I often winced or pulled back when my grandmother, who I loved dearly, would come out of nowhere and hug me, but if my mom told me that we were about to see \"meemaw\" and that she\'ll want to hug my neck, then I was happy to jump into her arms as soon as I saw her. My mom was terrible about randomly tickling me, poking me playfully, patting me, etc. and I would always flinch every time. She always said she didn\'t understand why I didn\'t like to be touched, but she never realized that a poke, pat, or tickle is actually sensory input, and if I have not already factored it into my list of expected things to feel, the sudden touch will be unwelcome, regardless of how I feel about the person making the contact. <br /> <br />As a teenager and young adult, I have been looked up to by my younger cousins, as well as pretty much all other children I encounter, and they often want to hug me or play with me when they see me, which I have no problem with. But if you ever pay attention, you\'ll notice that I welcome the hugging, carrying, etc. only when I am expecting it. On the other hand, my favorite kid that I was just carrying around a few minutes ago can unexpectedly come up behind me and grab me or jump on me, and I will flinch and jump away as though the kid disgusted me or something. Once I realize it\'s him/her I will apologize and usually go ahead and hug them or whatever to let them know it\'s OK, because it wasn\'t the kid or the actual contact that upset me, but rather the unexpected sensory input that I had not yet prepared myself for. <br /> <br />In addition to that, there\'s also the issue of whether or not the message I send by engaging in physical contact is the same as what other people will interpret. In other words, if I feel sure that everyone witnessing this hug will interpret it the same way that I do, then I\'m OK with it and I will hug back, but if I\'m afraid I will be misinterpreted and \"painted\" incorrectly, I will shy away. For example, if my cousins are visiting and give me a hug in order to greet me, I pretty much know that everyone sees this hug as a greeting and nothing more. Thus I have no reservations about hugging back. On the other hand, if my brother\'s girlfriend goes to hug me as a greeting, I\'m going to be fuzzy on exactly how everyone will look at it. In this case I may allow her to hug me, but I will clearly not hug back in order to make it obvious that she is doing the hugging and not me. By remaining lifeless I leave nothing to talk about on my part, and it leaves me without the anxiety of wondering what everyone\'s opinion is. Also, by not comletely shying away I avoid creating a scene. It is neither a reflection of my friendship toward her in any way, nor a lack of desire for physical contact, but rather it is a defense mechanism designed to protect me from anxiety caused by needing to evaluate other people\'s feelings, which I am unable to read. <br /> <br />In conclusion, the odds of having an autistic person who truly does not like physical contact is going to be roughly the same as finding an NT person who does not like to be touched. It\'s just that the circumstances and stipulations regarding when touching is allowed are going to be entirely different when dealing with an autistic person. And understandably, people who are not used to dealing with autistics will not know how to interpret and recognize these alternate rules, thus creating the misconception that physical contact is a no-no. <br /> <br />So with regard to that, I would have to say that this myth is about 99% FALSE. There\'s no absolute certainty in my mind that there isn\'t that one child out there whose autism causes every bodily touch to result in sensory overload, but for the most part, we like human contact as long as it is kept within our realm of understanding. <br /> <br /><div class=\'post_sig\'>-   ~Nick   Still in touch with my inner child ;)</div>'

'<P>My son actually learned how to pee standing up in the shower. For the longest time he wanted to sit down, then one day I had him in the shower and encouraged him to try and pee. He did it and thought it was pretty fun. I gave him all sorts of kudos for it, then the next time he went to go potty I said, \"why don\'t you stand up like you did in the shower?\" He did, and that was the end of it. It also helped that everyday at school the teachers took all the boys to the bathroom at the same time and he watched them standing up (as well as watching daddy). So, he did get a lot of positive modeling before he actually decided to do this himself.</P> <P>Another you might consider is creating some visual cards that you place right above the toilet in the bathroom.

'<P>We parents do what we have to do. </P> <P>It is definitely true that the \"accepting\" school district in a cross-contracting situation NEVER has to accept a child from another district. This would be true even if you tried to send your child to another district in PA. The difference is that, if you live in NY, BOCES is not considered a cross-contracting situation. But since your child is a sort of \"visitor,\" he can be bumped. This has ALWAYS been true. It\'s just that it has taken until now for BOCES to decide that it no longer wants to take \"out of district\" kids. BOCES changes its rules whenever it wants to. And if this has come through the NY Legislature, there\'s really nothing that can be done. But the truth is, this did not have to come from the LEgislature. The \"hosting\" district (in this case, BOCES) just had to change its mind. I mention this so that parents who want to send their child into a public school in another district (cross-contract) realize that the drawback is that the placement can be reneged on at any time. Your own district cannot pull your child without changing the IEP, but the \"host\" district can simply stop hosting - without any reason given. Sorry.

' <div class=\"postbody\">BOYCOTT OF HORIZON DAIRY GENERATING NATIONAL PUBLICITY  The Organic Consumers Association\'s (OCA) call for a boycott of the nation\'s largest organic dairy brand, Horizon Organic has recently generated stories in the New York Times, USA Today, National Public Radio, and the Associated Press. The media coverage has highlighted the growing backlash by organic consumers against industrial scale dairy feedlots, who are misleadingly labeling their products as \"USDA Organic,\" even though the animals on these factory farms have little or no access to pasture. In addition, most of the cows on these giant feedlots have been imported from conventional dairies, where they were weaned on blood, injected with hormones and antibiotics, and fed genetically engineered grains and slaughterhouse waste. While Horizon sources half of its milk from family farms where the lactating cows do have access to pasture, Aurora Organic, OCA\'s other major boycott target, gets all of its milk from intensive confinement feedlots. Aurora sells its \"organic\" milk to supermarket chains including Costco, Safeway, Giant, and Wild Oats, who bottle it under their own private labels.

I have read much of the discussion related to toilet training and I want to congratulate all of you for your hard work!  I spent much of my graduate work researching toilet training for children with developmental disabilities. Toilet training is extremely difficult and take patience and a whole lot of orchestration.  I teach a life skills class for students in elementary school and have toilet trained kids up to about 12 years old.   I have had a lot of success when both home and school are on board.  I tell all of my families that consistency is the key.  The protocol I have used an found successful is very similar to what you have all described.  I suggest doing a reinforcement evaluation if you do not know what is absolutely the most reinforcing for your child.  That must be the coveted item when your child is successful!  However, have back ups and slightly less reinforcing items for good tries. Also, always be aware of where you child is.  However, if they are not interested or fearful of the toilet, reinforce for close proximity until your child is sitting on the toilet.  Space out the reinforcement one successful until your child eliminates in the toilet.  I take my students completely off of diapers/ pull ups (except for night time).  Their whole lives this is where they have been trained to go, doing this will take that comfort away.  I then suggest getting a 15 minute kitchen timer (dollar store people!!!!).  After 15 minutes do a pants check, if they are dry HOORAY!  Mini party for them!  If wet, with NO AFFECT direct them to the bathroom, say &quot;ugh oh, wet&quot; put their hands on so they feel and make the connection then have them help (as much as they can without increasing frustration too much) as they get changed.  Then spend 5 minutes on the toilet to make sure they are empty and start the 15 minutes over.  After 15 minutes of success, take to toilet and sing a little song.  For some students I reinforce with smaller reinforcement just for sitting on the toilet.  For others I bring out the big stuff when they have eliminated!  They are on the potty for 5 minutes or until success!  BIG PARTY after success and keep on going!  I have had kids trained in 2 weeks.  I have also learned over time that it happens when the child is ready.  Don\'t sweat it if they aren\'t ready!  I have had preschool teachers try the same protocol with no luck... a few years later, the kids are successful!   Keep trying!   You guys are doing great and feel free to ask questions!</div>'

'Showing progress is key. I would accept this intervention now but insist on some kind of gauge of your child\'s present level of performance. THen insist that he be reevaluated at some interval (maybe 6 months). If he is not making significant progress, ask for additional services. SInce he is young enough to be in EI, the rules for what a state is required to give vary from state to state. Work closely with the EI personnel.'

Any input is greatly appreciated.  I\'m driving myself crazy about this.  </div>  This is one of the reasons we haven\'t moved.  Yet. While I have relatives in a state that\'s considered good for services, I still remain where I am because I get a lot of support from my immediate family who live in this state and we got a fabulous offer from the school district.  They\'ve been really wonderful to us this year and last so for now we\'re willing to stay put.   I fully understand how scary and overwhelming it is to move to a new place.    I know people who have moved from here to Houston, Texas for services.  I think Texas is one of those states that has health insurance coverage for autism.  Before you or your spouse accept a job offer in another state, please make sure your insurance coverage with a new employer includes ASD services.   If you move you can connect with other parents of kids on the spectrum in the area and they can help you with babysitting and/or direct you to providers who are reliable.    Worst case scenario if you move and you hate it, you can always move back to your current state.

'<P>We had a similar situation. Kids loved their drinks a night, especially my ASD son. R would wet occasionally, but C would wet 3 - 4 nights per week. This was never suprising to me since R is the light sleeper and C is the heavy sleeper.</P> <P>Last summer in August (boys were 5) and dh was traveling for a week and I just decided I\'d had enough of changing the entire bed each morning. I told the boys a BIG FAT LIE and it worked. I told them that I was so worried that they weren\'t waking up at night to go to the bathroom because it wasn\'t good for them to pee in the bed and get pee on their skin and get rashes (you get the idea) that I called the doctor and asked him what to do. I told the boys that the doctor said that they could no longer have drinks in their room at night. They bought it hook line and sinker. They grumbled for 2 nights or so and then it was fine. My dh was astounded to come home and find out I\'d managed to pull this off. Now the kids wet only rarely, maybe once per month, and only then when they\'ve been in an atypical situation (like my parents watching them) where they get more drinks than normal.</P> <P>We also bought a cute dixie cup dispenser that we put in their bathroom in case they need a sip in the middle of the night, but the rule is they have to go potty first if they want a drink. Sometimes they\'ll wake up in the night and call for a drink, which I\'ll get as long as potty first.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Kristy  Mom to 10 year old twin boys (1 PDD-NOS, 1 ADHD)</div>'
