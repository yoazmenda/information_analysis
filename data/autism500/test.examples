'<P>I actually respectfully disagree IBGECKO. ODD is often a comorbid disorder with HFA/AS. ODD is oppositional defiant disorder in case anyone is wondering.</P> <P>I think it would be a very wise idea to get him checked out by a developmental pediatrician (these docs have an additional 2 years of training in developmental issues past their pediatric training) and/or a pediatric neuropsychologist. Rages/tantrums are not uncommon among kids on the spectrum. I personally feel that ODD is just a part of some kids\' autism spectrum disorder and I know there are others that agree with me.</P> <P>I\'m not qualified to diagnose either - especially without seeing your child. However, the sensory issues, lack of eye contact, playing better with younger children, difficutly with expressive language and inappropriate expression of emotions are hallmarks of being on the spectrum. But again, you need to see a professional to really make sure. I would ask around and see who the best person to see is - not all professionals are created equal! <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley2.gif\" border=\"0\"> You might check at your local ARC agency and/or an autism/Asperger\'s support group. Parents of kids on the spectrum are the best resource for finding out who to see - they have fought hard to get what they have and usually are VERY willing to help those coming after them!

'Have you visited the classroom they are proposing putting him in? I would do that before I\'d agree to any placement. Of course, you\'ll have to remember that the kids you\'re seeing today are a year older than your son is now, but seeing a placement is the best way to know what possible issues will be. He may need a consultant to come in to bring the teacher and staff up to speed on his issues. He may need a one-on-one aide. He may not need much of anything. Seeing what the situation is will help you understand what he WILL need.'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I\'ve gotten myself very confused. DD was on Custom D-lactate Free until a few days ago. I thought she had a flare up of clostridia after a parasite cleanse, and I increased the probiotic and this seemed to help. She said the poop hurt, not while she was pooping, but on her skin, so that is why I thought the poop might have had an increase in acidic bacteria (?)  We switched her to VSL3, and overall it seems like a good change for her, but today she woke up from her nap hysterical and didn\'t calm down until I put her in a baking soda bath. Could she have gotten acidic from the VSL? Or from die off from the VSL?  Also I am noticing a few crystals in her diaper. She got this before, before we went on the LOD. Could switching to VSL be involved in this?  Overall she seems happier but more ADD-like. The ADD type behavior is typically associated with oxalates for her, but since VSL is supposed to help with oxalates, I\'m confused.  thanks for any advice!

' <div class=\"postbody\">We were only able to attend two days, but it was fantastic. There were SO many people there! It was so therapeutic also, to be in a room with so many other parents going through this. This just had to be the number one thing that made it worth going. When I think of the rough days ahead, I now know that so many others are going through it as well - and even in worse ways.     I learned a LOT about how crucial ALL the pieces are to the process of healing the gut and fixing the methlyation process. I think the overall aim is to heal, then fix this process so that the body can produce glutathione and detox like it should. But every single thing is important . .zinc levels, magnesium, B6, etc. - it all has to be there.    Right now our son is STILL deficient in zinc and magnesium, so the other stuff can\'t work. Now I see why that is all so important and why I have to fix those issues before we can procede.     There are also other metals that can cause problems ...aluminum, antimony, lead, etc. They can be there w/o tests that show they are. Detox is important, either through chelation or natural means.     Anyway, it was GREAT. I feel very empowered and not so alone.  Some of the parent to parent sessions were also fantastic. SCD diet is BIG for a lot of parents/kids right now - more than I knew. I talked to one mom who had used it and made me feel that it was doable for our family as well. I probably will head in that direction soon. - as soon as I can get through this semester in mid-May.     Enzymes were not really stressed, though. I wonder about that. Many parents use them, but don\'t rely on them as the cure-all.    P.S. - I\'m sorry that I did not get to \"see\" any of you that were there. The nametags didn\'t really work that way.

'Another think that you might want to consider. There is some research out there that shows that kids on the autism spectrum don\'t toilet train until they are at the point of putting together two word phrases that are COMMUNICATIVE. This does not seem to be because they need language to learn about toileting. It seems to be neuro/developmental. That the brain is developed enough to toilet train at about the same time it is ready to communicate in more than one word. If you think about it, that\'s EXACTLY how it works with NT kids. NT boys are know to train later and they are also known to talk later. Is it such a shock that our kids, who are know to talk even later, are not ready to toilet until later? If you look at the thread about what age did our kids train, I think you\'ll see that the majority were at least 4, many 5 or even school age. IMHO, these people are trying to do something unnatural with your child. If you feel strongly about it, DO NOT ALLOW IT. As this child\'s parent, you have that right.'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Autism has been around for 60 years and has been closely studied for decades by psychologists and related professionals.   If autism and giftedness are related, this relationship would  have been uncovered long time ago.  There is no scientific study to my knowledge that shows autism and giftedness are significantly correlated.   We know that there a few autistic savants (the number is small and in double digits, compared to perhaps hundreds of thousands of autistics around the world).     I have looked at gifted student population in my school district and it\'s around 10% of the general student population which means 90% of general population are not gifted.  So, even if 10% of the autistics are gifted, we have an overwhelming majority of 90% of autistics who are not gifted.           If autistic people are gifted, where are they?   Is there any autistic among top 100 living musicians, writers, architects, painters, mathematicians etc.             It\'s possible that autism and giftedness are related and autism may be suppressing the giftedness.  What\'s the point of this giftedness? It\'s like trading your eyes for a nice painting.      I too wish to believe that autism is giftedness but the evidence we have so far point to that autism -- for the most part-- is a profound disability.</div>'

'Give it until the end of the school year before making a class change. When my DD first started pre-school, it was really rough and she made limited progress from Sept through January. That was when we moved her to the special ed pre-school at the school district. From Feb-June, again, she made limited progress and it was downright discouraging at times. The next school year she did much better. She did a total turn around, and during that school year she started attending kindergarten for 2 hours. By the end of the year she was full time in kindergarten. I think she had to get used to the setting and her communications had to improve before her overall performance improved. I also think having role models for behavior helped. If she had been in the class with lower functioning kids, she wouldnt have developed as fast as she did. Good luck, focus on the postive. Observe the other class. If you feel your child is too high functioning, then dont move him. He needs the positive role models that the higher functioning kids will help provide.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Jana</div>'

'You can ask for an FBA at ANY time. And, since it is an evaluation, it is subject to IEE rules, which means you can get an independent eval afterwards if you don\'t agree with it. But, personally, I think it\'s best to go with the results of the FBA and use the resulting BIP (into which you definitely can have input) and the success or failure or the BIP will tell if the FBA is correct. If the BIP fails, have the authors adjust it. This is going to be a process.'

'<P>Okay, after the losing him on the bus incident (see post from a few days ago if you\'re interested), the school seems to be stepping up.</P> <P>The ASD teacher called me to check in and to tell me that ds seems to be anxious toward the end of the day and asking how much longer they have. She said that unless you were looking for it, it is not noticeable and a lot of the other kids (NT) are anxious too because it IS A 6 1/2 hour day. But, she wants to schedule two 10-minute gross motor breaks for ds - one in the am and one in the pm. She will have him deliver mail to different parts of the building and maybe do 2 or 3 different ones so that he gets a long walk and some time away in addition. Also, she\'s going to take him to the resource room to finish lunch if he doesn\'t get to finish. His class has a bathroom break right after lunch which is 10 minutes, so she can give him about 7-8 minutes to finish up (they only get 20 minutes to eat) and then swing him by the bathroom and go to class. All of this will not interfere and not make him stand out. She said he seems to be interacting and is following routines great and doing everything that is asked of him. She just wants to be pro-active and not have his anxiety increase. She told me she didn\'t want him \"sent\" to her room - she wants to invite him to her resource room when he needs it so he ends up being able to eventually do it on his own when he needs it. </P> <P>The principal sat with he and 4-5 other kindergarteners who didn\'t finish their lunch today and chatted with him and made sure he was able to finish more of his lunch. He usually is able to eat in 20 minutes, but with all the noise and the kids talking to him - he just didn\'t budget his time well. </P> <P>Anyway, she also threw out a few other ideas but said she absolutely wants him to be doing everything the other kids are as much as possible and she believes he will be able to and has been impressed with how he has done so far. He is definitely the mildest on her caseolad, she said and she said that a layperson would not pick out that he was even having any issues. She just could read it on his face that he needed a break. So, tomorrow we start doing that. </P> <P>Well, I gotta go get ready for our garage sale, but just had to share that after a rocky start - the school (especially the ASD teacher and principal) seem to really have a handle on my ds - after only really knowing him for 2 1/2 days so far!) is doing good. They are WAY better than his previous school and I actually told the ASD teacher that I was floored that she was calling me to work on PREVENTING a future problem rather than waiting until one happened - because that was not my experience at his previous school.

I know about the more severley functioning autistics ive met plenty    I would like to see their lives get better they dont seem too happy to me sometimes  .    sometimes i will admit i have trouble seeing not everyones autism is as high functioning as mine.     and i need to be helped with this and helped to understand what the familys going through so i can help them.     since im the only preson at my leval of it ive ever known personally in my entire 20 year exsistense     if fine Men like you can help these kids and young adults with Biomed go right ahead i find it interesting what you told me about the kids at your clinic.     quite frankly i wish some of these options were availible to me when i was small but i did good with what i could.    It kind of feels like being in suspended animation and waking up in the future when i heard some things it could be overwheliming.

He locked another kid (not S.) in a closet and threw a book at S..      Plus some mother (wonder who it could be?) wrote letters to the spiritual director of the school, the head of the PTA, the head of the order of sisters that run the school, and the bishop about the continued bullying.  That mother all sent copies of each letter written to the principal to the above people and threatened to attend class EVERY DAY with S. until the bullying was addressed.

'Not sure who should do the observation. I am guessing that the distraction is caused by something, and whoever diagnosed the something would be the person who best understands the reasons for the distraction. So this person would be the one to do the observation. This statement (now that I think about it) has a bunch of assumptions built into it. I am assuming that if you have a diagnosis, it was not a school person who did it, and so this person would be able to independently do the observation. If your case is different you\'d need an outside specialist in the area that leads to the distractability.<br><br>An FBA might help since being distracted would be a behavior that impacts school work. Depends on the quality of the person doing it, and writing up the results. If this is a school person, I would not be surprized if they write all over the report \"We don\'t see any of mom\'s concerns in the classroom.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Okay- here\'s a thought.  I have lots of these every day, just not all good ones.  IF he seems to like the toys with a lot of buttons, noises, whatever, you have a couple of options:  1)Use these as \'rewards\' for behavior that is desirable.  IF he waits for two minutes, half a minute, whatever you deem appropriate for his age and ability.  My son\'s receptive language is still quite iffy--yesterday he was throwing rocks, and I honestly believe that he has no clue what \"you could hurt someone\" means.  Again, you have to decide what he is capable of.  Once he has a toy that he wants, set a timer to allow him to play with it for ten minutes, or fifteen or a half-hour.  It will help him to grasp the concept of time length.  THEN he has to do something else that YOU want to do.  He can hear the timer go off, and eventually he will understand time limits and transitions.  2)Get rid of most of the toys he wants to play with that are causing him <em>excessive</em> stimming.  It sounds harsh, but we have had to do that with my son, because I would have lost my mind long ago with the constant repetition of sounds. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" />   I just can\'t handle it after so long.  He still is getting the concept of \"enough!\" and I feel like a bad mom when I can\'t take it anymore.    Ultimately, I think that the aspie kids give good advice.  Try to redirect his stimming to something that is not self-injurious.  When you think about it, the excess of stimming can be injurious to social skills.  Other kids don\'t have the paitence or understanding that parents do.    One other thing--tantrums are IMO a good sign of autonomy--of your son\'s \"sense of self.\"  He knows what he wants, and he is figuring out what methods work to get it.  The manipulation begins.....smart boy...</div>'

Our 3 yr old has autism and our 2 yr old shows the red flags, but we are still working with him in \'hopes\' it is purely sensory issues (however, he has significant language delay).</P> <P>We have had mostly positive experiences w/ professionals talking to us about our kids. These professionals defniately talk to me differently than DH who tends to be more sensitive in that he feels everyone is judging his abilities as a parent. I think that as a professional, you and others should trust your instincts in reading the non-verbal (and verbal) cues of the parents...then cater how you discuss issues based on that. For instance, the OT is very open and blunt with me about my childrens progress and what I need to work on at home. However, her comments are more reserved and presented in a way where DH doesn\'t feel he is being judged or criticized. I know that it sounds silly for him to be acting like this, but how can parents (especially the man) not help but feel some guilt...he is still dealing with it.</P> <P>As for me, I want to know everything, including suggestions as to what I can do at home to be consistent with the activities my child learns at school or at therapy. </P> <P>As for the worst experience, that would be the ST who evauated my ds during an EI evaluation.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Dory,  Who told you that you have to have approval for your son to stay home?  Was it the people at Connection\'s Academy?  I couldn\'t find any information in any of the charter school laws that apply to Florida that suggest that a special ed student needs approval from anyone.  Generally, charter schools are first come first served admittance regardless of a student\'s background.  Because charter schools are publicly funded, they must take all children from a qualifying district, just as a traditional school would.  Now, the laws seem to be a bit different in Florida than here in Oregon.  Here, the child\'s home school district is responsible for providing any necessary special ed services, whereas in Florida, it appears that the charter schools themselves must provide the services.  So, we may be dealing with a situation where online charter schools <em>can\'t</em>  provide services because of the nature of the schooling.  Still, as the parent of your child, you should not need permission from anyone to enroll him in a school of <em>choice.</em>.  If you want some help, I can have my husband try to find out what the exact requirements are in Florida.    Also, as an alternative, I\'m not sure if you have come across any information regarding the McKay scholarship program which was established in Florida to allow parents of special needs kids to remove their children from their home district and place them in any public or private school of their choice.  Here\'s a link <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.floridaschoolchoice.org/Information/McKay/\">http://www.floridaschoolchoice.org/Information/McKay/</a><!-- m -->  Now, it appears the deadline has already passed for the first part of the upcoming school year, but you may be able to apply for the second half of the year.  From what I\'ve read, most public and private schools will aceept McKay scholarship kids, so you should have a decent selection of schools to choose from if you go that route.

He is still pretty oblivious to alot of things about himself (or maybe not!) but it still seems that way and if i tell him he has autism and i can just picture him crying and screaming I HAVE AUTISM over and over loudly during a meltdown. </P> <P>Horizon, when i met with his teacher i told her i was worried him not being able to stim freely will make his behavior worse since he usually stims here and there sporadically all thruout the day and i asked if they could have a spot for him to go where he could stim privately like on a bean bag chair or something, so ill see about that monday. The good thing is that I have always told him that everyone is different like some people are light colored some are dark, some are bald some have lots of hair etc. so he himself says out loud \'Everybodys different\' thruout the day when he sees someone (or on tv) whos physically different in some way.</P> <P>Tzoya, I myself felt relieved in some sense when i found out aspergers so I guess it would help him tremendously to know but even tho he obviously knows hes different whether he was told or noticed himself i dont think he will be able to understand that he has autism. Explaining things to him are very hard he doesnt seem to grasp things correctly. Other than yesterday I havnt seen anything else that made me think he thinks hes different he is usually completely oblivious even if people are starring at him (unless hes grumpy). I love the idea of havign the doctor explain it to him. Hes had many dx\'s already but his neuro is a very kind understanding man so I think i may talk to him about talking to my son as well as us letting him know. I can understand how ur story is similar here I just wish I knew he noticed this before <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley18.gif\" border=\"0\"></P> <P>Micki, thats so cute and its great ur son is confident liike that! That is how i want my son to be and i need to get cracking before his self esteem gets completely shot down. I love the way u put it about them having thier weakness\'s and strenghts. </P> <P>I am actually having a hard time dealing with this while my son is being his normal self I cant stop thinking about yesterday and bawling my eyeballs out, i feel so tired and have a huge headache from crying so much, of course the fact that its that time of the month probably isnt helping me. My husband thinks im obsessing and that its normal to be teased and we cant shelter him but hes worried himself because this is how he was as a kid but he was more of an angry lashing out chlld more than our son is who is really sensitive so hes worried too. Im totally scared that this is happening in kindergarten, I am extremely sensitive so I think thats why im obsessing over this too much myself. I totally hate this. </P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by 143hayden on August 16 2008 at 1:59pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS-8 ASD/Seizures/Mood dis/OCD/ADHD/S.I.D./Tics/GF-CF-Soy Free diet  For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord...plans 2 give you hope & a future Jer. 29:11</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">You\'re welcome! I don\'t have any \'test\" results but at this stage in the game I can tell just by his actions. The next day was a difference ~ and the whole first week was a dramatic difference. There was a day or two of regression and he seemed pretty good again. Then we went to Disney and I kept him on it but he blew his diet, got allergies and just general sensory overload put him back into crying/tantrum mode. He\'s getting back to normal now.     I tried taking him on and off the pro bio gold to see if I saw a difference but I don\'t think I did. Like I said, it almost seemed to make him more sensitive to some \"safe\" foods. I did however, see a difference when I took him on and off of DMG. Just as an FYI, he isn\'t really gluten sensitive but sensitive to a lot of fruits. And we just stay away from dairy as a general rule.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Our daughter turned 3 last week. she is still pretty much nonverbal. we originally thought she was just speech delayed . This is what everyone told us even her pediatrician . As a precaution we set up an evaluation and recieved an Autism disorder diagnosis that day. This hit us like a hammer. My wife originally did not want to believe it ,this lasted for a few weeks. As we learned more about the spectrum things started coming together.     Our daughter is a well behaved child , and has always been loving torwards us. She seemed to hit every mildstone in time, besides speaking. Looking back now we realize when she sarted to show symptoms os ASD. at around 20 months  she stopped doing the few things she had learned , like saying no and waiving bye. She stopped clapping her hands with us and become more independent. she would respond to her name less often and acted as though deaf. Her diet also become more limited although her appetite is always good. At around that age she also started not liking certain people for no reason. She hated company. She also started losing interst in toys .    In the last 2 months she has made obvious improvements on several fronts , which reassures are hope for her future.    Realizing  our daughter is not developing properly has been the hardest thing we ever had to deal with . It can certainly be described as a nightmare that will not go away . The word Autism still hurts.      Basically our approach now is not to worry about the label and focus on the treatment . Whether a child is Autistic or not but exhibits delays the treatment is the same and can only benefit her . In less than 2 months of us knowing her dx , she has made such positive strides. At this pace we have everyreason to believe she will be mainstreamed eventually .    Good luck to you . For me finding out my family is not the only one has made a bi difference . The grieve and pain we felt when  we were given her diagnosis has not gone away , but each day is a little more bearable.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Everyone has their own experience.  Mine was much different so in my world, biomed is <strong>the</strong> answer.  My son has proven this to me time and time again through the many biomed treatments we\'ve tried.     I believe many parents do give supplement breaks.  Many kids do have infractions, mine included.  However, unlike this person\'s experience, the results have been negative.   Though now, after he\'s had a chance to heal if we give him a supplement break, he\'s fine.  And we see additional gains when we add some supps back in.  Back one year ago, if my son ate gluten, he\'d be pooing his pants and acting stange for 2 weeks minimum.  Now after healing, he can tolerate small amounts.  There are so many biomed treatments out there.  And kids are so different.   IT\'s so hard to speculate on other people\'s situations.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Jen! <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">So</span> glad you checked in.  I\'m sorry your\'re struggling with your oldest. Please try not to be so hard on yourself.  In your shoes, many would not have hung in as long as you have.  You\'re a mom to 3 little ones, not just one, and you have to love and protect each of them and do what is best for your family.  This is obviously not an easy decision or one you take lightly, and I\'m sure that many people in your shoes would do the same - I\'m know I would.  Gosh, I think it\'s challenging enough to parent 3 little ones at the same time, let alone dealing with all of the confusion and contradictions of autism and the aggression that your son is showing right now!  I hope that you find some relief for your son and your family with medication.  Even if it only provides enough relief for you to maintain your sanity while sifting through all of the other options and possibilities, it will be worth it.     I know what you mean about the DAN approach.  Although I have been fortunate to see many positives, I have also been recently disillusioned by some aspects, and I think that in some cases it isn\'t much different than traditional medicine in that at times not enough consideration is given to the individual children and their families.       I really hope you\'ll keep in touch.  Are you still considering taking your boys to see Krigsman?  Where in PA do you live, btw - if you don\'t mind sharing?</div>'

I am currently taking a course on parent advocacy and I hear from other parents in this class about what the school is doing or not doing for their kids and the speakers, moderators etc tell them the same thing. You have to advocate for your child. NONE AND I MEAN NONE of the special ed laws that are now in force were inacted because a senator or govenor etc said gee.... maybe we should help some of the children that need special education. All of the laws are in place because parents advocated for them. The only way to continue to receive add\'l services is to get groups of parents if you have to and advocate for our children. Even in the early 80\'s there were not the same laws we have now, and the only reason our children are even allowed to attend public school is because parents forced the issue.

'<FONT size=2>Some Mothers Get Babies With Something More<BR>written by: Lori Borgman<BR>Columnist and Speaker<BR><BR>My friend is expecting her first child. People keep asking what she wants. She smiles demurely, shakes her head and gives the answer mothers have given throughout the pages of time. She says it doesn\'t matter whether it\'s a boy or a girl. She just wants it to have ten fingers and ten toes. Of course, that\'s what she says. That\'s what mothers have always said. Mothers lie. Truth be told, every mother wants a whole lot more.<BR><BR>Every mother wants a perfectly healthy baby with a round head, rosebud lips, button nose, <BR>beautiful eyes and satin skin. Every mother wants a baby so gorgeous that people will pity the Gerber baby for being flat-out ugly. Every mother wants a baby that will roll over, sit up and take those first steps right on schedule (according to the baby development chart on page 57, column two). Every mother wants a baby that can, see, hear, run, jump and fire neurons by the billions. She wants a kid that can smack the ball out of the park and do toe points that are the envy of the entire ballet class. Call it greed if you want, but we mothers want what we want.<BR><BR>Some mothers get babies with something more. Some mothers get babies with conditions they can\'t pronounce, a spine that didn\'t fuse, a missing chromosome or a palette that didn\'t close. Most of those mothers can remember the time, the place, the shoes they were wearing and the color of the walls in the small, suffocating room where the doctor uttered the words that took their breath away. It felt like recess in the fourth grade when you didn\'t see the kick ball coming and it knocked the wind clean out of you.<BR><BR>Some mothers leave the hospital with a healthy bundle, then, months, even years later, take him in for a routine visit, or schedule her for a well check, and crash head first into a brick wall as they bear the brunt of devastating news. It can\'t be possible! That doesn\'t run in our family. Can this really be happening in our lifetime?<BR><BR>I am a woman who watches the Olympics for the sheer thrill of seeing finely sculpted bodies. It\'s not a lust thing; it\'s a wondrous thing. The athletes appear as specimens without flaw - rippling muscles with nary an ounce of flab or fat, virtual powerhouses of strength with lungs and limbs working in perfect harmony. Then the athlete walks over to a tote bag, rustles through the contents and pulls out an inhaler. As I\'ve told my own kids, be it on the way to physical therapy after a third knee surgery, or on a trip home from an echo cardiogram, there\'s no such thing as a perfect body. Everybody will bear something at some time or another. Maybe the affliction will be apparent to curious eyes, or maybe it will be unseen, quietly treated with trips to the doctor, medication or surgery. The health problems our children have experienced have been minimal and manageable, so I watch with keen interest and great admiration the mothers of children with serious disabilities, and wonder how they do it.<BR><BR>Frankly, sometimes you mothers scare me. How you lift that child in and out of a wheelchair 20 times a day. How you monitor tests, track medications, regulate diet and serve as the gatekeeper to a hundred specialists yammering in your ear. I wonder how you endure the cliches and the platitudes, well-intentioned souls explaining how God is at work when you\'ve occasionally questioned if God is on strike. I even wonder how you endure schmaltzy pieces like this one - saluting you, painting you as hero and saint, when you know you\'re ordinary. You snap, you bark, you bite. You didn\'t volunteer for this. You didn\'t jump up and down in the motherhood line yelling, \"Choose me, God! Choose me! I\'ve got what it takes.\" You\'re a woman who doesn\'t have time to step back and put things in perspective, so, please, let me do it for you.<BR><BR>From where I sit, you\'re way ahead of the pack. You\'ve developed the strength of a draft horse while holding onto the delicacy of a daffodil. You have a heart that melts like chocolate in a glove box in July, carefully counter-balanced against the stubbornness of an Ozark mule.

' <div class=\"postbody\">1) You don\'t need a DX at age 3 to get early in pre k, just meet need based on their testings.  In fact you don\'t need a medical dx until age 6, when medicaid pays to the school for treatments, and are more stringent.  2)  I always stressed over early on my son wasn\'t learning.  BUT HE WAS! He just demonstrated it in is own time.  I am filled with hope recently because literally within the last 3 months, he has EXPLODED with gains.  He would do one word only, especially no, no gesturing, grabbing my hand to take me to what it was he wanted.  Now he\'s had one instance of two full sentences in a row! (spoken to his OT when mad at her for making him work, pointed at the door, and said &quot;Get out of here!  Leave me alone!&quot;  And several other small sentences.  He sits down with <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> and can essentially quote the entire book now (yes we\'ve read it 3 times a day for 3 years...)

'<P>My ds was on tenex earlier this year, and it didn\'t help. We ended up stopping the tenex, and starting him on risperdal, and most recently zoloft. My son is also usually very well behaved at school, and saves the worst of his behavior for when he is at home. I think it\'s because while at school, he doesn\'t want to stand out from the other kids, and when he\'s at home, he is in his comfort zone. He doesn\'t have to worry about keeping it together anymore, so the behaviors that he has been holding back all day are let loose at home. </P> <P>It sounds as if things are in a crisis situation right now with your son. I would call your regular pediatrician ASAP for an immediate appt, and see if your ped can get your son in to see the neurologist or a psychiatrist before February. Sometimes when a referral comes from another doctor, especially if there are concerns, they might be able to make an appt sooner than what you are able to make when you call for an appt. </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- L~    Mom to Sarah 14 NT, Michael 13 ASD, ADHD and Jonathon 9 NT</div>'

Maybe I shouldn\'t have used the word \"data\" as it was probably more a comment from personal experience.   Unfortunately, I was so focused on other things there that I jotted a note down and didn\'t write who the comment was attributed to.  HBOT for us is down the road, so I wasn\'t really tuned into it as much.  Crystal\'s question just rang a bell, and I remembered that I had jotted down that somebody said at the conference that oxidative stress at the low pressures was more of a possibility than a probability and that they were not seeing it in their experience -- I really wish that I had taken a better note here, but I know I\'m not making this one up since I\'ve sort of just begun to study HBOT, and the whole oxidative stress issue is one that I have just recently (just before the conference) become aware of.     I\'ll stay out of this debate (since it looks like there is one), though, because my knowledge ends with what I heard at the conference and through some internet searches to find out where people are taking their ASD kids.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</div>'
'<P>I\'m new but just had to jump in here about homeschool. I hs my son for year n\'half. After he went from a small private school where he was thriving academically to a ps where he began regressing both behaviorally and academically. At this point we were just in the process of having him tested, not through school but privately. The school refused to make the slightest of accommodations until an IEP was in place. I had to make a decision to either expend my energy educating my child or fighting a school district. Since I have an MA in education, I chose to educate him. After about three months of being home, our behavioral ped couldn\'t believe the change in my son. For third grade we chose to send him to a different school district, his teacher made the comment that he has adjusted wonderfully, is socially connecting with other children, participating in classroom discussion and is academically on track (although he struggles with reading and spelling.) She went on to say, \"he\'s not as withdrawn as other homeschooled kids I\'ve had.\" Hmmmm, most homeschooled kids I know are very bright, outgoing individuals. </P> <P>Although having my asd son at home was challenging, and I had many a day where I wished it were someone else dealing with his frustration, it was also very rewarding. One of the most positive aspects is to tailor a program that fits your child instead of making your child fit a program. For example, timed test really increase my sons frustration level. He\'s been told at school ( and I\'ve been told) that unless he is timed he can\'t recieve a certificate for that level. So he endures the timed test because he wants the certificate. As a homeschooler time is not of the essence but rather do you know the facts...hmmmm, what a concept for education. His principal tells me that he (my son) needs to feel accomplished by completing the timed multiplication test. I say when he sits down and completes the test in HIS time (which at home is about 1 minute 20 seconds while at school he must complete it in one minute) and gets all the problems right - trust me he feels accomplished - he is up on his tiptoes jumping up and down saying \"Look mom, I did great!\" </P> <P>I get so tired of trying to make children fit into a \"normed\" box. I read an article not to long ago theorizing the thought that autism may not be the disability but rather the disability lies within the society that they must exist. In other words if our world was \"things\" oriented rather than people oriented who of us would have the disability?????</P>'
'<P>My son is on Risperdol and has tics. Risperdol is used off label to treat Tourette\'s. Sometimes when the medicine needs to be increased, the underlying tic becomes pronounced, which may be what you are seeing.</P> <P>There is always the risk of tradive dyskenisia, but generally on very high doses of Risperdol. My son takes 4MG/day, which is approaching the maximum dosage for his age/size. My doctor says he doesn\'t feel comfortable going above 5 mg but thinks that under 5 mg is \"safe\" at least with my son who is 12 and approx. 120- 125 pounds.</P> <P>I would call your doctor. He/she will probably lower the Risperdol to see if the symptoms improve or worsten. If they worsten that would indicate that the medicine needs to be increased.</P> <P>If you google Tardive Dyskenesia photos, the majority show a movement with the lips and tounge, not so much the head. <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley31.gif\" border=\"0\"> Good luck.

' <div class=\"postbody\">If you are 3 months into GFCF and are seeing good results, enzymes are probably a good thing to add to aid in digestion but not necessarily to stray from the diet.      I understand how hard the diet is to maintain. I have 2 young boys on the spectrum both GFCFSFCF w/a variety of different intolerances and allergies.  I prepare 80% of what they eat from scratch and they don\'t eat the same foods.     There are ways you can try to improve your son\'s eating that may not be too taxing on you.  Does he eat fruit, legal fruit leather, packaged GFCF baked goods, pretzels, popcorn, potato chips, rice pasta, rice bread, etc.??  Believe me, I know how hard it is but if you are seeing good results, going off the diet, even w/enzymes, could be disastrous.      The other way to add calories/nutrition is to add in a protein powder.  My oldest son refuses to eat first thing in the a.m. and I have to get him to school.  I\'ve added in brown rice-based protein powder to his a.m. supplement drink and it keeps him full and energetic until his morning snack.    If you have to have an infraction, then definitely give enzymes and keep a close watch on your son for physical symptoms (bloated belly, diahrea, headaches, eczema, etc.) and for behavioral symptoms (hyperactivity, sleeplessness, nightwakings, increased stimming).  I would hate to see him lose any of his gains.      Hang in there and best of luck!    Dana R.</div>'

The adding of probiotic and a yeast killer will populate the gut with good bacteria ... and its easier than when you have bad bacteria and you have to replace it with good. So it can get good fast ... and guess what ... its very sustainable.  I\'d consider adding goat yogurt with live cultures ... hard as it might be to find/make ... Yogurt works like nothing else, you can eat it all day and literally it does everything for you, take care of constipation without creating diarrhea ... helps digestion, proctects against ulcers ... everything.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi and welcome to the board it is a hard diagnosis to have even if you already know it is still a blow.  Your kids are lucky to have you to fight for them and get them the help they need.  You will find most of what you need for that here from other parents who have already fought the battles or are currently going through the same things you are.  I understand the reluctance to start on biomed it took me two years of reading other parents experiences and doing my own research to decide to do it and then I only started with eliminating milk it was several more months before we eliminated gluten and wonder of wonders if he didn\'t finally start sleeping all night and potty train.  Even if you don\'t do biomed the GFCF diet has also been recomended for ADHD as well as autism, I found that out from my NT daughters school nurse.    You will have a pretty steep learning curve but realize that this is a marathon not a sprint you have time to learn and remember to take a breather once in a while.  Take care of yourself so you can take care of them.  Again welcome to one of the greatest support forums out there, it is the only reason I kept my sanity for the first few years of my sons diagnosis, I\'m sure it can help you too.  If you do decide to try the diet email me I have a bunch of tips on cooking, recipes, eating out and an eight page list of safe foods most of which can be found at the average grocery store.  <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:mouseker1@gmail.com\">mouseker1@gmail.com</a><!-- e --></div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">My son went to Dr. Kaplan\'s office in Tarrytown, NY for a few months.   My son is a toe walker and I was hoping that the prism lenses would help for that.  He went to the office for vision therapy once a week and was given exercies to perform at home everyday.  It helped him learn body awareness.  They said he should wear the glasses for about 1 year and do the exercises every day.       I had just had a baby and the office was about an hour away, it became too difficult traveling to the office once a week with three kids.

The psychiatrist chose this, because I mentioned that I\'ve heard that typical stimulants often increase anxiety in children who already have that tendency (which Jake does).

'If he does is when he\'s mad he might do it because he gets confused.<br> Normally a child recognizes anger and the feelings with it, with autism the child might be confused about what it\'s experiencing. The headbanging takes the confusion away by giving very mild pain, but more importantly the painkillers. The older a child gets, the more force it can use and therefore increase the chance of injuring itself, so a plan to teach your child to stop doing it might be a good idea.<br>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Crystal,    Your thread entitled \"Sasha said his first word during HBOT yesterday\" regarding your son\'s first words in the hbot chamber on Jan 25, 2006, was a very inspiring post.  This type of information is very compelling to other parents, which is obvious from the number of responses that followed.  That is a very powerful testimony, and it is important that it is accurate, as readers may attribute that milestone to the hbot treatment.

We went to see her this Saturday and she had a 4 hour session with Sasha and he said his first word since Autism today.

Doing so diminishes the testimonies of parents everywhere.  I found many other descrepanices of information on this board, but these were the most important points.  As Crystal has rudely suggested to prior posters on the autismweb board, perhaps interested parties can use the search feature on the Alabama board to read more.  As you did in your skirmishes on several other boards when your information is questioned, you will probably claim to be attacked, claim that readers misunderstood, layer on off-topic info, suggest the topic is dropped when you exhaust alternative explanations, and finally resort to name-calling (in this thread -- name du jour is \"jerk\" apparently).  Its a pattern.  Just stick with the truth, and btw, this is not it:  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Actually I said that they could come use it for free.</div>    Nope you never said that.  Sorry.  And you didnâ€™t mention anything about doctors being involved anywhere.  The post was removed as you were soliciting in the support forum, which is a no no on a lot of parent message boards, as you have no doubt learned by now.    And really, posting member names on another forum is such a cheap shot -- hopefully interested readers will take a little time to read on the Alabama forum and make that determination on their own.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Ayurvedic medications are not laced with metals unless they were made in a factory. Typically they are plants. Metal traces are from a factory.  I do remember facts from 14 years ago, since I was 22 years old at that time. In fact I remember everything I studied in fields of engineering and mathematics and computer programming as well since I base my living on it and remember the non engineering parts as well even though I dont use it. However I cannot show it to you as proof that it was even printed.  As for IM or sub Q its all the same thing, your stomach and intestines do not get a chance to excrete it. Look up the recent mercury in burger incident - someone decided it will be a cool prank and put mercury in a fast food burger and this lady I believe ate most of it before finding it and it happened in the US. The docs said it will be excreted. Lead, arsenic and mercury all accumulate in your body. You may excrete 90% and that will remove the immediate fatality, but it will add to the previous consumption and eventually do damage. People die eating paint chips because they have been eating it for years and they ahve enough of it to cause serious harm.   Ayurvedic medications do not by themselves have mercury, we typically use whole plants or parts of plants. Start making them in a factory because urbanisation has killed the fields and woods and you have a whole other story. We have used leaded gasoline and other poisons as well as 2 stroke oil burners clear into the late 90\'s, but back in the 80\'s and 70\'s we had so few automobiles it was so amazingly clean.   In any case, autism as a condition and as a term is balloning in india and china and seems to be in step with the vaccine program. It may also be in step with the industrialisation which has accelerated the pace at which toxins are dumped into the air/water. In either case metals are at the heart of it.

Some kids tend to be more fever-prone than others, and it\'s the body\'s way of fighting infection.  So I would guess that he may have a fever to combat an \"invisible\" infection, that is, one with no other detectable symptoms.  One thing I learned from the article is that the severity of the temperature may have nothing to do with the underlying cause.  So he may get a high fever with a slight cold, but run a low-grade fever with a raging ear infection.  Interesting....

' <div class=\"postbody\">I\'ve got a lot to say on this particular topic so excuse me if this is TMI, but just my thoughts:  My biggest issue with RDI is that I think it is kind of wishy-washy and vague, a fact that, in my personal opinion, they hide behind a lot of elaborate vocabulary.   For example, a consultant might say: &quot;We need to use multi-modal broadband communication to promote dynamic intelligence. We will be addressing the core deficits of autism by restructuring the environment in order to provide the child the opportunity to relearn skills from a crucial missed stage of development. Your child will learn about facial referencing and nonverbal communication as an apprentice in the guided participation relationship&quot;  Yes, phrased like that, parents may feel like shelling out the thousands of bucks that this program costs. Now let\'s rephrase in plain English:   &quot;Kids with autism have trouble with facial expressions and body language. During the day, make a point of using more exaggerated facial expressions and gestures, and try to make sure you child pays attention to them vs. tuning out because cartoons are on in the background.&quot;  Phrased like that, it sounds a lot more like common sense and nothing particularly earth-shattering. Too me, that was my opinion on a lot of the program - once you got past the hype and the elaborate terminology it was just common sense and nothing revolutionary. Revolutionary, to me, would be a teaching method that was scientifically shown to somehow help autistic children suddenly understand nonverbal communication. Trying to use more nonverbal communication and drawing the child\'s attention to it - that could be summarized in a quick bullet point in a pamphlet and be just as useful to parents, without such an involved program or a consultant.  My second huge issue with the program was/are the Parent Goals. Oy vey! Seriously, I\'m hearing about parents doing months of parent goals in order to \'prepare\' for the child goals. I found the parent goals obnoxious, for want of a better word. They might include the parent writing an essay on where they see their child in 10 years, or proving to the consultant that they are \'journaling\' every day. Um, what? Early intervention is so crucial, I want to pull my hair out when someone tells me parents should wait months to focus on child-oriented therapy so that they can learn to \'journal\'. Seriously.  Other general issues with the program, again, only my opinion:  - Not backed up by adequate scientific evidence or controlled studies, especially for all the claims made.  - Can be very expensive. Access to the online system alone is about $600 a year plus the cost of a consultant, who typically seem to charge $3000-$8000 for a six month \'package\'. Some consultants require you attend the parent training in Houston, which is another few thousand plus time off work and travel, and I believe it is mandatory that both parents attend together, so then there is the cost of child care. (Also, you have to attend the Introductory conference or buy the DVD before you can attend the Parent Conference.) It is largely video-tape based so you need a digital camera and a computer capable of handling the videos.  - This therapy is owned. Oh boy, is it owned, trademark and all. The owners can and have made sweeping changes to the program, and they can make these changes based on nothing but their own opinions if they choose. In therapies like ABA, parents can work with an ABA therapist who is more in line with their way of thinking. In RDI, if consultants do not do RDI the way the owners prescribe they can be booted out of the program.  - Generally relies heavily on videos, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming for families already dealing with an autistic child. Often, consultants want you to tape the activity, do whatever reformats/uploads are needed, upload it to their operating system (which, in my experience was never up or incredibly slow,) edit it, etc., etc. To me, that is an unacceptable amount of time haggling with digital video vs. interacting with the actual child.  - Consultants, increasingly, are telling families that in order to work with them they must quit other therapies such as ABA and Floortime. I have a big issue with telling families they have to yank a program that may be benefitting the child.    All in all, if I had to make a recommendation to a parent, my advice would be to hire a consultant only if money is no object and you have cash to spare for that plus the other services you want. If it\'s RDI vs. ABA, speech therapy, OT, etc., I would not recommend it. Yes, there are some useful points in the program, but I personally think you can get most of them from just reading the books.</div>'

'just so everybody knows.<br> <br> A<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> Fastpass</span> is a machine that is at the front gates of most of the \"popular\" rides and is available for everybody to use. You take your admission card to the Fastpass machine, put it in, and it spits out a ticket with a return time on it. You come BACK to the ride at the return time and show them your Fastpass ticket. They then put you in a seperate - much shorter line - than the standard standbye line .... and you get to ride. Again, Fastpasses are available to every disney guest and they are a way to let a computer stand in line for you.<br> <br> There is also a Special card available for people with Disabilities which is a completely different thing from the Fastpass. It would be best for you to take a letter from your Doctor, stating that a member of your party has a medical disability that makes it impossible for them to wait in a line with large crowds of people. Take this letter to Guest Services at one of the Main Parks (Epcot, MGM, Animal Kingdom, or The Magic Kingdom). They will then give you a card that you can use to avoid the large crowds and longer lines. Take your card to the Disney Employee standing at the front of the lines. They will then either let you into a special waiting area - or use the Fast Pass line. You will generally still have to wait some in line, but usually not nearly as long as you would in the \"regular\" line. This card will also allow you to use your Stroller as a wheelchair all over the Disney property, the rides, restaurants, gift shops etc. You can also use this card to get the Disney Employees to assist you in being seated at the edges of crowds instead of in the middle in the larger shows.<br> <br> This is a very popular message board that has a seperate forum about visiting Disney with disabilities. There are several parents with ASD kids here, as well as tons of other Disabilities.

If you had bad experiences with biomed why is it that you would come to the board for biomed other than to stir up trouble?

I for one never asked for Winnie to be the one asking questions for all us poor new parents to autism and biomed. Give people some credit for being able to read what someone posts and decide whether or not it applies to our situation or if we CHOOSE to believe what is being said!     As to your comment about the group homes what you do with your child is your business. I for one have NEVER stated that if you dont follow a certain path thats where your kid will end up and you should not make a sweeping statement that eveyone doing biomed successfully believes that.     Ask all the legitimate questions you need to but if you dont like the defensiveness then dont cause us to be defensive!</div>'

If preschoolers had such insight on what made them \"feel better\" -- and cooperated accordingly -- they would willingly eat their vegetables and refuse sugary snacks and Happy Meals.

' <div class=\"postbody\">A child will be qualified for ESY season (exended school year) based on needs. Not all students qualify. But they will tell you months ahead on your IEP meeing if your child is going to the half a day ESY program so that you have enough time to apply, request for that service if they say he won\'t be going to the ESY program. didn\'t you know that? I\'m sorry to tell you this, having 2 weeks left before school is out, i wonder if they will do anything right now. But i encourage you to talk to the program specialist as soon as possible and do all it requires to make him eligible for the ESY. If no luck, what you can do is ask his teacher around who will be available in summer. Not all the special ed teachers/aids will have a summer job, some are desparate to get extra income. In our county the ones hold masters in special ed will have priority, so teachers who are in school, or who hold certificate might have less chance to teach in ESY season, so they want to work. ( our aba therapist is also his teacher and she is in school, she isn\'t teaching this summer so she is asking around if anyone needs extra hours of aba) They charge anything from $15-$30 an hour. If push come to shove you can have atleast few hours of aba/vb a week. I don\'t know your financial situation, programs like summer social skills program, summer buddies, will help. Play groups, swimming class, may be adding a weekly speech therapy and ot will help filling the long day.

'<P>Thanks for answering my post. My GS has what is called a REPS Provider through the county mental health department. She is supposed to be somewhat like an aid however his teacher has asked that she not be present in the classroom because it disrupts the other children having an additional adult there just helping one child. My GS was placed with this particular teacher at the beginning of the school year last August because his Mental Health Counselor recommended her because she has delt with PDD/ADHD children in the past. The only connection I have ever heard the teacher mention is that her son is Bipolar. I don\'t know if she has any specific training in Autism. Also the REPS Provider only goes on a 3 month contract and then she is done unless there is an application for an extention. The provider was also supposed to help by coming into the home and observing my GS in is every day activities. She would come by for 20 or 30 minutes about avery 10days or so and play with him, but then say she had to go put her daughter to bed and she had to leave. Several times she would pick him up (sometimes alone and sometimes with a group of other children with an assortment of behavior problems) and take them to a movie or the park. After her 3 month contract was up we requested that it not be renewed because we couldn\'t see what benefit GS had gotten from it. The raps provider would say \"I\'ll call you tomorrow and let you know what time I\'ll be picking nick up.\" And we would wait around not making any plans and she would\'t call until a few days later, always with an \"excuse.\" She just wasn\'t working out. </P> <P>So this month, after the \"green wire\" episode at school everyone in the system decided to try GS with the same REPS provider again. Although his mom and I had reservations about this provider being used once again. She has been back in with up only 2 weeks now and is up to her old tricks again. I can\'t see that she has brought him any benefit, just aggravation for us wondering when she will show up. </P> <P>Also to my knowlege GS has never had an IEP . He will be finished with this school year next month. We have bought a house and it just happens to be in the school district that is at the bottom of performance reviews. I believe that under the No Child Left Behind Law because of that we can pick the school GS can go to but I\'m not clear if we have to provide transportation yet.

Did I say spit? I ment to. Oh he was a bolter also. And strong. I mean at 2 he could push a 50lb coffee table accross the room to get at things to destroy. He removed all the tile from my fireplace at 6 months of age. Oh ABA:-) <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /> That was the life saver. After 2 weeks he said his first word. \"milk\" After 6 months he had over 200 words. Sure He screamed his head off in there. But he screamed his head off anyway. At least he was getting the help he needed. He had 35 hours a week. He is awsome now!!!! He is 5 1/2 and he can read! We were able to unlock all the doors when he was 3! We were able to take down the 3 feet high cardboard fortress we had erected around the house!!!! We untied the chairs from the table! What I am trying to say is in my case I owe ABA big time. And sure it was rough but through the pain came awsome progress I do not think would have come any other way.

Shilo</div>    I know this is the education side ... so I\'ll make it short ...  At 2 1/2 mine was that way too ... except he wasn\'t trying to get out of the house just to get out ... he\'d want to stare at the children at play sign across the street and hence want to get out, and wasn\'t that bad a biter or spitter or a hair puller ... but yea head butting ... chin plowing yea ... screaming for everything and 100% non verbal ... NDF, B12 brought out language with no other therapy in that period, play therapy helped him keep his clothes on, school took some of the crazed running out ... but I suspect he does it 100 times worse at school and is tired at home, and Lupron took down the gritting and head butting out and the chin plowing too ... all in the last 6 months. He is 3 1/3rd right now. DMSA added to lupron seems to be doing very little, but time and testing will tell. May be time to do DMPS I think. But 2-3 rounds I\'ll probably have to persist.  Cool.

'I don\'t think anyone has ever told a poster to avoid doctors. Since the beginning of time people have sought answers from their peers and the internet is simply a much larger gathering of those peers. <br><br>Added to this, doctors are not all around experts. You choose between a general practitioner that has a mid-level knowledge of most conditions and a specialist that has a deep knowledge of a few conditions. If you are not sure who to go to, you get bounced around wasting time and money and some times you even wind up with bad information from a doctor that doesn\'t have the knowledge to diagnose what you suspect. This I know from personal experience as I spent 3 years being told nothing was wrong with my son so I completely disagree that a doctor\'s word is law. Had I used the internet more and used forums to seek advice, my son could be an astoundingly different person today and not struggle as much. I would not have spent 3 years in hell thinking I was a horrible parent who couldn\'t teach my child how to behave or say his abc\'s.<br><br>In the forum you have many people giving support and many parents (and cousins, people with autism and even a few people who work with asd professionally) who can point you to resources and share knowledge they have spent their time researching. Our resources here are not futile. I have received much help in this forum. <br><br>I think you\'re mostly referring to the rash post and those like it and if the parent thought her child was in need of urgent care, she would have taken him. It was a rash, there were no other symptoms. It\'s not an odd post.

' <div class=\"postbody\">My daughter is 7 now, but when she started mainstream preschool at 3yrs. old, she didn\'t talk much at all, she was a bit aggressive at the time, but I went on like nothing.  When the teachers confronted me on it, I then fought for her to stay there, because I felt how was she to learn HOW to act if she wasn\'t around typical kids?  So, they added an aid to the classroom and put her in a 4year old class.  With the older kids, if she did something inappropriate to them, they would talk back.  The 3year olds were too scared to do anything.  Then when she turned 4, I placed her in a universal prekindergarten through our school system.  She had WONDERFUL teachers and it was very structured, which is what she needed.  It was free play where she got into trouble.  She received OT and Speech right there.  She went every morning and absolutely loved it.  I\'m not saying it was all smooth sailing every day.  We definately had good and bad days, but so do typical 3 and 4 year olds!  I was always involved which always helps.  This school gave her love and patience, where as the first one she went to, I felt, couldn\'t and didn\'t give her what she needed.  It might take you a few different preschools to figure out a good connection.  If you do what is in your heart and your gut, and be fully involved in every way, then you make the right decisions.</div>'

'<P>Okay, My son doesn\'t use these but he did have some made for him, The generic pictures the schools use and if your child is in with a school therapist they could make you some. </P> <P>However, if you have digital camera, and a photo printer you can make your own PECS cards. All you do is take pictures of things that your child likes, foods,toys,tv,bath tub, bed, etc common items and print the pictures off, glue them to a piece of hard card stock(scrapbooking paper works) write in magic marker what the object is and laminate it. I have a HP PHOTOSMART 8450 PRINTER, got it at BestBuy, it has a layout format for all sizes of pictures, the size we use is snapshot size(a little larger than a wallet photo) the printer can print about 9 pictures on one sheet(different pics of course)the size works great. I think that actual photos work better because they are things your child sees and will recognize, you can also take pictures of your child eating and label it so and so eating, same for potty time, bath time. </P> <P>My son has a picture book called \"Adam\'s picture book\" he has his fav\'s in it such as his slide,swing,ball, elmo, fishtank, blues clues, crayons, etc.. He doesn\'t use PECS but he does look at this book all the time. If you need to make a schedule board you can use the same pictures, poster board, and velcro tape, one piece goes on the board and one goes on the picture. You can put an evenlope(big one) at the bottom to \"catch\" the pictures as you remove them from the board, or you can use your refridgerator and use magnet tape. It sounds like a pain but its actually a pretty fun project, if your child is using it. You may want to start out with the book first to see if your child will get in to it, or maybe a couple of pics on a smaller poster board for a routine board. Good Luck!!

You really helped me see how going in without an IEP would be worse for him.</P> <P>Unfortunately, I\'m not sure he\'ll be getting an IEP before August. We just completed a private eval. and have been told by the school that they are no longer staffing for IEPs until October. I\'m not completely panicking yet- I have an advocate. The school is willing to work with us and pick a teacher that he could remain with once the IEP is put in place as well as inform his teacher ahead of time about him.</P> <P>We have decided to have him enter 1st with an IEP (hopefully) in his home school. If I don\'t do this, I\'ll forever wonder how he would have done at his home school. If things go poorly after 1st grade, we are considering the Mckay scholarship and having him go to a private school, maybe one for kids on the spectrum. </P> <P>This has posed even more debate at home- what is the best path for children on the spectrum?- to be schooled with as many opportunities to be with \"neuro-typicals\" or to be placed in special schools with other high-functioning asd children?</P> <P>I\'ve been reading tons of books, talking to everyone I can. Every professional involved with my son has a different opinion- and they all have their good points! </P> <P>This is one of the hardest things for us right now- I know every child is different, but it is so hard to deal with the fact that not even the professionals can agree on what is best to help him grow up to lead a life where he can be independent and self-sufficient.</P> <P>Once again, thank you everyone for replying.</P>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi, I also have identical twin girs who are 32 months and both have Autism.  They have some nasty smelling stools too, but honestly I think ours was from bacteria and/or yeast and now they smell like metals from chelating.      We have been gfcf for 10 months and on many supps and MB12 also.  One of my girls has had GI bacteria issues so I would check for that because it could be causing the foul odor.  Also yeast smells bad (during die off especially), but I have also heard others say it smells like bread - yeasty.      If it is an intermittant thing, it could be viruses especially since it seems to sting their bottom and redden it quickly, but if it is a regular occurance, it is probably a different problem.    We love \"poop mysteries\" on this board so I am sure there will be other responses!  Good Luck with your twins!  Kim</div>'

VSL probiotic is supposed to have the bacteria to degrade oxalates and I think that group uses it in their yogurt even.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Yeppers - and there is no way you can just learn it all in one sitting. Doing an ABA program justs takes time - time to take it in daily and time to generalize it.  It seems to take a lot of conversations also between me and our consultants for me to really get what\'s going on.     We\'ve been doing a program since November. We didn\'t really take off w/ it until February, but it has helped him so much I can\'t believe it. Time seems to go slowly, and each day can seem like there\'s no progress, but over a period of months there is a lot.     They help you, too, through those difficult situations - and you can\'t predict them, that will continue to occur. We have monthly meetings where they ask me what problems we\'re having at the present, and then we work on those. So, we just take it as it comes.     One important thing is DATA. W/o good data, you can\'t run a program. I feel our program\'s strength is the data we take and that the therapists share among each other. Our first program was horrible and that\'s why we switched providers.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Joey, 6 yrs., PDD-NOS  GFCF, Yasko, RDI  Did ABA for 14 mos.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Joey, 6 yrs., PDD-NOS  GFCF, Yasko, RDI  Did ABA for 14 mos.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thank you all for the comments.      Winnie, were those hours actual Lovaas-style ABA hours?  Or a mixture of different therapies?  And by different therapies, I don\'t just mean other styles of ABA, but OT or ST or PT, etc.?    Jennifer, it\'s my <em>guess </em>that the 25 hour thing came from the congressional report, the Educating Children with Autism one.  My kiddo\'s neurologist was on that committee.  It\'s funny, though, because when I called the office to ask some questions about the report, all I could get was an office staff  member telling me how great segregated, autism-specific special ed classes were, and how those 25 hours could just be in broad-spectrum special ed.  This seemed incongruous with me to the therapies recommended in the congressional report.  My neurologist works closely with the school districts.  This makes me suspicious.    I hear you about 40 hours of anything being a bit much, but what changed my opinion of that was a comment in the independent psych evaluation we had done by a doctor I adore and trust completely.  She said that without 40 hours, much time is spent... and I cannot remember the wording she used... but it meant something like outside of therapy, he\'s in his own world, and not learning or growing.  So I started watching him and indeed he would stim like crazy out of therapy, but be fine during therapy, and that included other types of therapy, not just ABA.      That\'s what makes me wonder if other therapies would be OK to use, despite the 40 hour gold standard.  If he\'s interacting, focused, targeted, does the therapy, or even just the moment in time, become equivalent to Lovaas-style ABA in its benefit?  If he\'s totally focused on his OT session, using language beautifully and trying to achieve whatever objective, how is that less beneficial than a table-based ABA session?  Or for that matter, making cookies with me or something, if he\'s totally into it?  This is what\'s keeping me up at night.  The quality of therapy in that 40 hours has to have something to do with success, not just the number.  Is there something organic in well-performed ABA therapy that makes it inherently better?    ETA Irene and LM, we were posting at the same time.  I appreciate the additional info.  Irene, I do remember that from the study... how interesting...    LM, that quote you cited is quite interesting.  We recently had a home organizer go through our house, and as a result we \"purged\" about 30 garbage bags full of whatever stuff (toys, clothes, etc.) and gave it all to charity.  The result has been really interesting.  With less c--- in the house, my kids are calmer and play longer with the toys they do have.  All that $$$ and STUFF was actually getting in the way.</div>      <span class=\"gensmall\">Last edited by <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8&amp;sid=a2dede0d84462d4ad009c59d5504a8bb\">MCA</a> on Thu Aug 10, 2006 10:19 am, edited 2 times in total.</span>'

What was absoultely invaluable was having speech built into the program</div>.       That was our experience as well. Technically he had/has 30 minutes twice a week, through school, but especially in the earlier stages when he didn\'t have any language this was a ridiculously small amount. But we pushed language throughout the day, both in therapy and in the natural environment- there were no \"freebies\", every time he wanted something he had to make an attempt to communicate. We wouldn\'t ask for anything unreasonable, the expectations were always on the cusp of the next skill above what he had- so for example when he was 100% nonverbal, all he had to do was look and point, then one syllable (sp?), then a word approximation, then a word, 2 words etc. All this, all the time every day. And once he was at a certain stage, say 2 word requests for example, we wouldn\'t allow him to \"get away\" with an earlier stage (like 1 word). The key was to make it all worth his while, so he was being reinforced like a king, for good talking. I found that for my son only working on speech 24/7 across all environments would help.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ \"When many cures are offered for a disease, it means the disease is not curable\" -Anton Chekhov</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ \"When many cures are offered for a disease, it means the disease is not curable\" -Anton Chekhov</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">This is how I view it; however this is only my opinion so please, I don\'t want anyone to get upset.  I view my daughter as high functioning autism.  What I mean by this is that she goes to a typical school, she can read, write, talk, swim, etc....  She is delayed in all areas, but she is able to tell me what she needs, she is able to participate in all activities, she doesn\'t throw temper tantrums, she doesn\'t hit herself, etc...  She can &quot;pass&quot; for typical, but there are many many times she stands out.   When I tell people she has autism, they just look at me.  I don\'t know what they think autism is, but they don\'t think it\'s her.  I wish there could be a movie portraying autism as some of our kids are so the world could see it doesn\'t have to be devestating.  What I can tell you is that it is still hard to be a mother of a high functioning autistic child in the fact that sometimes you can feel like... good, we\'re ok, and be all happy, then something happens and BAM you are reminded that you are not typical and it\'s thrown right in your face.  It\'s hard to come back from those lows.  I love my baby girl and she has taught me the true meaning of life.  I am grateful for every inch she progresses which goes unnoticed with typical children; and I have a typical son.  I\'m worried about what will happen to her when she becomes an adult, but I have to take one day at a time.  That\'s it.  Hope this helped.  Dee\'s mom</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">At about the 15th session or so:    I brought my son to my parents\' place and we started HBOT on the 23rd of October. Since then we\'ve missed about 3 sessions, so I guess we\'ve completed 14 sessions.      Improvements:     1. Much more imitation.     2. Playing \"so big\".    3. More gestures. Shaking his head. Touching both his hands to his head when he sees someone. I think it\'s his way of saying hello. He learnt 2 new gestures in just 1 hour. That too from playing with someone across the room. No one was trying to teach him &gt; he saw that guy shake his head, so he shook his head.    4. Learning things very fast. I showed him a picture book and pointed at a circle 4-5 times and then I asked him where the circle was. He patted the circle figure pretty consistently.    5. For the first time yesterday,he tried to point. He lifted his hand up at the light and the fan when I asked him where they were.    6. I\'m not sure, but I think he\'s slightly easier to put to sleep now. The quality of his sleep hasn\'t improved however.    7. He had a jealous fit when he saw me playing with the household help\'s daughter. He started hitting the girl who was carrying him. This is not a good thing no doubt, but it is certainly instinctive behaviour for a 1 year old.    8. The most important thing is that he\'s gesturing spontaneously and looking at us for approval.    9. Has always played ball, but now plays in a very appropriate turn taking way and for a long time without losing patience.    I think that\'s it for now. As I\'ve already mentioned in another post <a href=\"http://www.autismweb.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8653\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.autismweb.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8653</a>, I\'ve also seen increased aggression and lots of very irritable behaviour.

'<P>I personally think 5 is on the early side for any kind of hand writing expectations. I went through this with both my sons - 1 PDD-NOS and 1 typical. AJ had OT for a couple of years before he started to write but we believe that helping him climb a lot to develope his arm muscles really helped(both of them). Pencil grips and big fat pencils also helped. Handwriting Without Tears is a great program. We also used a slantboard and installed 2 white boards in our house. The angle is great for arm development and gives you plently of opportunities to practice all the time - drawing, numbers and letters. Both my boys became successful writers half way through kindergarten. Montessori materials have \"sand paper letters\" that are part of the hand writing process - we did not use them but I have heard they are helpful.

The other likes to swing or takes off to look at the pond.  I usually try other trips when my husband can come.  I think they have to learn how to be in public eventually.  It is draining! I truely understand the rollercoaster of emotion.  One week I think my boys will be OK . The next week I don\'t know how they are going to make up the deficits.  I am questioning everything I do.  Supplements and GFCF diet Does it really make a difference? ABA? Sometimes I don\'t know how much more I can take. I often wonder if I will ever be able to relax and watch my boys have fun on their own.  I guess when they make it through this hardship it will be like i won the superbowl!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">My therapists seem to approach Aidan\'s compliance, behaviors and control issues from a less stringent model. Basically, they take into effect what is considered developmentally appropriate for his age, and they do analyze why he isn\'t complying but when determining what to do a lot goes into the decision. Sometimes they step back and change their own style of how they are presenting something, keeping him interested or motivated - does he need some more sensory, gross motor breaks, excitement etc. Soemtimes they feel like we need to work through it but it is always in very small manageable steps. So sometimes if Aidan doesn\'t seem to be cooperating we may tell him he needs to stick with it 1 or 2 more times and then we really praise him and then he gets to make a choice about what we do next. Or, sometimes we feel like a better approach is to teach him a better way of expressing what he wants. So if he can lower his voice and ask nicely using a 2-3 word request - then he can have his request. I\'m just happy with it because each time a decision is made it seems to be made with Aidan the whole child in mind. I don\'t know if that makes sense. It seems, that my therapists and consultant are very flexible about Aidan\'s program because they are in no way strict traditionalist ABA people. they definately appreciate ABA as a powerful and effective way of teaching many things but they do not at all look at everything from only that perspective. They see the bones of ABA as a great way to outline a program but then the actual program we run is filled in with many things that are tailor designed to suit Aidan. </div>    Sounds like you have some very awesome and professional therapists, who thoughtfully take the child\'s behavior into consideration, and adjust their program accordingly. This is how I wish our program could have been, but ours were strict with no bending.

Do you know if there is a long waiting list to just get an aba therapist to work with you, even if you are initially willing to pay them on your own? Where I am going with this is if I start paying initially (hopefully not too long before I get into real debt!) for these ABA therapist services, and then work in parallel with my insurance company to get reimbursement. But I am just wondering if there is a long waiting list just to get an ABA therapist to work for you, because of lack of availability.</P> <P>J&amp;J Mom- Are you presently using ABA services for your kids?

'<P>I forget now how old your son is. If he is at the age of MANDATORY school attendance, send him back to school IMMEDIATELY. If you have him out of school for more than 10 days (this may vary from state to state, but ALL states have truancy laws), the school can (and probably will) call CPS. You will have CPS all over you and you may have to hire a lawyer. Personally, I think the school district purposely tried to keep the mediator from coming by canceling the meeting date. Do not let them trick you into getting into truancy issues so that they can further punish you and, through you, your son. This is SERIOUS. I belong to a lawyer/advocate message board and they\'ve posted that this can and does happen. If your son is below mandatory age, they can\'t do this. But there may be parents reading this post whose kids are older and might need this info. </P> <P>Get your boy back into school asap anyway, because a hearing officer will otherwise see you as an uncooperative parent. Put EVERYTHING in writing. Good luck.</P>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Our son was just recently diagnosed with autism.  We have been reading some books we bought and doing some research about the GFCF diet, but we have some concerns.  Our son was also diagnosed with a sensory disorder and does eat many foods and will not try new foods.  He also will not eat meat or veggies, he mostly eats bread and bread/flour products. Has anyone else had a child with this and put them on the GFCF diet?  What were your results?   We are worried that he will reject the GF foods......</div>'

What if he is happy with the way things are right now? There are a lot of things he would be better to not know anything about. His lack of connection to the real world protects him against the dangers of life. There are a lot of things I wish I never knew about.    Also too many things to choose from would make him frustrated, and having to balance his interests, thus limiting his joy in the special interests. Then it would be better to let him be without knowledge, and protect him from the horrible reality of the world.    Let people live in a dreamworld, and they become happy!</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Yes, thank you for sharing this!!  Yes, actually, I am familiar with the protocol--but have never done it.  I studied up on this a bit years ago when I was exploring the possibility that lyme was the cause of my son\'s autism and my family\'s health problems--it seemed a good fit since we were all sick in some way.  But then I figured out some things about mold, and went off in that direction.  I didn\'t really get on the parasite bandwagon until about a year ago, and never thought about his again.  It is exactly what I need!  It makes so much sense, really.  And a good thing that I can try on myself before I try on my kids.    It is so interesting you should post this now.  I had a HUGE die-off event this last weekend, and I had just decided that it was because I have been, for the last week, taking epsom salts baths again, plus oral magnesium for sleep, plus a glass of baking soda water to calm my very, very acidic stomach at night, plus two days of vermox.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" /> Didn\'t do it on purpose, it just shook out this way.  I got hugely puffy, like an allergic reaction or like my body was full of toxins or an infection.  I also had a BAD headache and felt almost crazy--huge fight with hubby, and then went to bed and slept for the day.  Just a mess.  The puffiness is subsiding.  I thought magnesium overdose, but now that you post this, I am wondering if this was parasite die-off due to the huge amount of salt I ingested with the treatments above, plus vermox on top of it all.    And if that\'s true, I really hate to think what it means.    Yeah--the CDC calling anybody a fraud is crazy.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

We had been on a new yeast med, Intracogizol (sp.?) and he told me to discard it, see how she is next week. It is rough here right now.

'Hey Guys My name Is Brandy Phillips. I just feel so lost. My son was diagnosed with aspergher syndrome when he was four. He is now ten and he got retested and the test came back inconclusive. My son is a great kid. He has no friends but all he wants to do is learn. He is so smart. Straight A. Student just no friends. He would rather learn they be outside. He has outbrts when he doesn\'t know what you want from him. We have been told consitency is the key. That just doesn\'t work when everyday is a new day. I wake up not knowing if this is the day he will actually go outside or the day he will ignore me and stay in his room. The one thing I love about him is how smart he is you can talk to him in about a dozen different subjects and he can talk to you about each one. I learn more from him than I ever did in school. I am so glad I found this sight. I don\'t feel so lost anymore.'

'<P>He should definiely be mainstreamed. My son is PDD-NOS, he didn\'t say ma-ma until 18 months, nor did he walk until then. Hedidn\'t speak 3-4 word sentences until he was 3+. We put him in a developmental pre-k class when he was 4, but we felt it didn\'t help him. We enrolled him in public school when it was time for kindergarten. He didn\'t speak or socialize well, he had boundary issues, (going from room to room). He had frequent temper tantrums at first, but each time he was promoted, he socialized better and his speech improved rapidly, (he was receiving speech therapy, and did until last year when by my wife and I and the therapist that he no longer needed it). My son came to realize that to get what he wanted he needed to talk. He still gets occupational therapy for his fine motor skills. My son will be 13 this summer and he\'s doing great. By the way I forgot to mention that in class he has a paraprofessional who works with him in class and she and even his classmates help him stay focused. Sometimes his attention drifts. He has many friends who he enjoys playing with. He\'s doing very well, he makes us proud. Mainstreaming, GO FOR IT.</P> <P> </P> <P> </P>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Oral B vitamins flare up yeast a lot for kids, like mine. We can only do the B12 nasal spray, and behind scd and Oxytocin, these have been our miracles, all within the last 6 months. My son has battled clostridia for well over a year. When his Oat test is normal, he is as NORMAL as he ever is! I mean just amazing. Here are his signs that clostridia is back: pinching, biting lip in frustration, saying silly things, random laughing, and not as good at school. Also adding \"t\'s\" on the ends of words. When this happens, we get the Oat test and clostridia is back. The only thing that keeps it away for us is Vanco. I have tried all naturals, and every other thing, and this wipes it out within  2 weeks, and he is back, and always better than ever. So now what we do is a small amount of vanco in the am and pm to keep it at bay. It is not long term, but it works. Clostridia is bad stuff, and it really takes a toll on my son. Jeni B is right, diet is our key to it coming back. We were strict SCD for a while, now we are on a rotation diet. Lots of veggies, chicken, fruits, and I also rotate some gf/cf items which works well and gives him more choices. The three times it came back I gave him a few \"extra\" snacks, all gf/cf but he just can\'t handle it. My doc says my son can\'t handle the artificial colors and dyes in the foods. So those snacks are given only sparingly, or on a special occassion.  For us it is the sugars, but not from fruit that bring it back.    I get mine componded, and a bottle is 80.00 with insurance. Mine is from Park pharmacy in Irvine, CA. I know they would never charge a lot for someone who has no insurance coverage, so they might be worth trying.    Hope this helps.     Tanya</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Talking \'bout aspies,      I am an aspie, myself, actually.  99.9% sure.  I\'ve got a family, a husband who I love <em>even though I want to chuck him out the window most the time</em>, I\'ve held down professional level jobs in my pre-mommy days and excelled at them.  I am just known as a little \"off\" by my friends, colleagues, and neighbors, which is embarrassing, but OK with me.  And I know when I am having a sensory overload moment and can take appropriate precautions to make sure no one needs me for a little while while I turn out the lights, put a cold cloth on my head, pop a pill (unfortunately) and wait for the world (and my brain) to mellow out again.    The difference is due to the difference between girls and boys on the spectrum, I think.  Girls on the spectrum, because of their socialization, learn to understand and navigate the social world better - not as participants but almost as sociologists.  I also think that girls on the spectrum tend to over-fixate on <em>people </em>as their obsession rather than <em>objects </em>like the boys do.  I remember studying girls\' magazines voraciously to figure out how to dress and act.  Therefore we learn how to \"act normal\" and end up doing OK, albeit kind of lonely sometimes.    hope this can encourage someone with a spectrum girl  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />      Debbie</div>'

We didn\'t have that before. That\'s what I\'m happy about, but I just can\'t be allowed to have any happiness over it . ..we\'ve always got to be concerned about something that isn\'t perfect.    And I know it\'sher way of always making sure we\'re moving forward, but it\'s tough emotionally on a parent.    Here is something he\'s done recently . . he found a stick on the ground that was in the shape of a Y.  A perfect Y. He noticed it, picked it up and said, Look, Mommy, it\'s a Y!!     I mean, that is just awesome as far as I\'m concerned for any 5 year old. He recognizes it - yes, maybe he writes it backwards, but he recognizes it frontwards.  And he also mentioned he has a Y in his name - fantastic.    And the speech artic as well. I mean, I got chewed for 20 mins because he still \"can\'t even say his name right.\" Well, the \"J\" sound - I\'m not even sure if it\'s a 5 year old sound yet. The school and the docs are telling us not to worry, that artic can be addressed in due time.  His language continues to blossom, and his thought processes we can just see are very much getting sharper, it\'s just the artic that continues to be a problem.     Don\'t get me wrong - our ABA folks are dedicated, organized, and they know their ABA stuff ...but I\'m not sure they\'re entirely accurate about basic child development and/or speech pathology.

Since I do not know you, your family, or your child personally, I hesitate to write a Social Story for you, as it would be similar to me making a pair of shoes for all the members of your family with the information I currently have about them. So, I am going to &#147;brainstorm&#148; on paper for you, and I would like you to view it as a personal &#147;shoe store&#148; so to speak: I don&#146;t want or expect you to cheer at every idea, but I hope I can suggest a few ideas that strike you as a good &#147;fit&#148;. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Recently, I consulted with a professional who was working on behalf of a mother who was terminally ill, who needed ideas to explain her own passing to her two young boys with autism. Here&#146;s what the two of us came up with: </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Create one/two <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #ffff66\">memory</B> boxes. In an effort to provide both parties with some control over the situation, encourage them to write letters or create <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #ffff66\">memory</B> boxes. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>If she is able and willing, Grandma can write and reflect or dictate to others her thoughts about your child, and perhaps use photographs to help recall those special times. These can be short letters delivered to your child by you when you return home. You can also deliver to her short letters that your child writes. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>When you are out of town, perhaps your child&#146;s caregiver can work with him to add to a <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #a0ffff\">box</B> where he collects photos, thoughts, videos, etc. of his experiences with Great Grandma. This doesn&#146;t have to take a large amount of time, in fact, the opposite. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Then, when you return, you can share a few thoughts about your visit, and your child has an important reciprocal role, to share what he has added to Great Grandma&#146;s great memories <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #a0ffff\">box</B>. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>I know Grandma is still alive, but the <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #a0ffff\">box</B> can begin an important transition. Recalling important times is important for all people &#150; which is why photo albums are so important. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Keep in mind the <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #ffff66\">memory</B> <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #a0ffff\">box</B> or scrapbook does not need to be presented in the light that Great Grandma may pass away; only that you are going to visit her to help her, and he can help you and the family feel better by collecting wonderful thoughts at home.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>A Social Story could describe the project to your child and its importance. I&#146;ve written a sample Story for you: </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>My name is Kyle. Lately, Mom has been going to New York to help Great Grandma. She will visit with her and help her in many ways. This is a list of things my mom did the last time she went to help Great Grandma: ....[include a list] It&#146;s important to help people in my family when they are feeling bad or sad. By looking at the calendar in this story, I can tell that mom will be gone for three days, beginning in the morning on Saturday. She is planning to return home in a plane on Sunday. Mom says that I may help, too. When mom is gone helping Great Grandma, I can help, too. I can try to collect pictures or things that we do with Great Grandma. I may have some things that I remember and can write (or record, or dictate). Thinking nice things about Great Grandma can help everyone. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>The <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #a0ffff\">box</B> or scrapbook that is developed before the funeral, can be added to after the funeral. Also, if Grandma is able to write a letter to your child when you visit, this can start the brief discussion of your visit that I mentioned earlier, and placed in the <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #ffff66\">memory</B> <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #a0ffff\">box</B>/scrapbook. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Dr. Tony Attwood has shared that a child with autism may not experience the same emotions as the rest of the family, and that&#146;s okay. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Depending upon several factors, your child may emotionally process the loss of Great Grandma differently than you or others in your family. That may mean that he seems less, or more, upset than everyone else. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>At the extremes, for some children the passing of a family member may result in minimal expression of feelings and a factual explanation. With some children, my experience has been that death is the &#147;ultimate change&#148;, not solely the loss of a loved one, but much more. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>The point that Tony makes, if I am speaking for him accurately, is that it&#146;s best to follow the child&#146;s lead on this one, versus trying to prepare him for a traditional emotional response that he may not experience or understand. </FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>What makes this so difficult for the adults involved is the emotional status of the rest of the family at this time.

' <div class=\"postbody\">One thing I\'m wondering about these very late regressors (like in Crystal\'s and respect\'s posts) - maybe they had developed some kind of encephalopathy that resulted in behaviors one can also see with autism. Remember, there is no one \"test\" to diagnose autism, and ultimately it\'s really a behavioral diagnosis. Other things can mimic it too. You can probably find autistic-like behaviors in many other psych/neuro conditions. I personally have an older family member who ended up bed ridden, and with multiple strokes, and she now withdraws herself from everybody, and only talks about 2 topics and only in the same way- many things she does remind me of Alex\'s quirks at one time or another. Also in teen years, I would really start to worry about schizophrenia etc. Not saying the vaccines those guys received didn\'t affect them, just wondering how accurate would an autism label be on a teenager with previously completely normal functioning, when this is a condition where by definition (DSM) the problems needs to have occured by the age of 3.  Alex\'s mom</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Regarding the blabbing, there is another dimension to the blabbing.  They not only blab (and blab inaccurately) away from us, they blab (and blab inaccurately) <em>in front of us</em>.    I used to give talks for mostly staff in which I would rattle off a paragraph or two full of word for word (or slightly paraphrased for privacy) things staff said about other disabled people, <em>in front of me</em>, because they assumed that I either could not hear them, could not (or would never) understand what they were saying, or would never repeat what they were saying.    I told them if they didn\'t want their words repeated at a talk someone gives later in life, to be careful what they said.    It tended to leave a lasting impression, considering it contained confidential information about dozens of people, as well as staff descriptions of how they felt about the assorted people (including me) and about their own uninformed speculations about people\'s \"real problems\" as opposed to whatever the person had been diagnosed with.      Favorites in the speculation department were saying that someone was not autistic if they showed the slightest sign of awareness other people existed (or similar misconceptions for other diagnoses, I just remember this <em>very obviously</em> autistic kid who was always getting called non-autistic by them because he grabbed people by the hand and led them places), and saying that nearly anything anyone did was designed to be game-playing or attention-seeking or some other thing that made staff the center of the world.      In my case I also got to hear rampant speculation about how I got how I was, and whether there was any point to \"treating\" me and why they got stuck with me taking up space when they couldn\'t \"do anything\" for me, lots of speculation about whether I could understand them or not, whether I was brain-damaged from a whole array of sources, and then the usual as described above.    If you ever want to hear exactly what staff in those settings thinks of someone, be a client.  They won\'t bother to find you important or comprehending enough to shut up and be polite around.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Sure. Almost any antioxidant will help.

The entire link may offer some help.    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">http://www.alternativementalhealth.com/articles/walshMP.htm Elevated histamine and/or elevated basophils indicate undermethylation. Review of symptoms and medical history can bolster the diagnosis. For example, most undermethylated persons exhibit seasonal allergies, perfectionism, strong wills, slenderness, OCD tendencies, high libido, etc.  Conditions associated with undermethylation: Anorexia, Bulemia, shopping/gambling disorders, depression, schizo-affective disorder, delusions, oppositional-defiant disorder, OCD.  One thing that is absolutely certain is that methionine and/or SAMe usually harm low-histamine (overmethylated persons)..... but are wonderful for high-histamine (undermethylated) persons. The reverse in true for histadelic (undermethylated) persons, who thrive on methionine, SAMe, Ca and Mg..... but get much worse if they take folates &amp; B-12 which can increase methyl trapping.</div></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Tami</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Tami</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I waited until my son was almost 10 to do B12--we did not have a good DAN doctor, and she was trying other things (I don\'t think she was up to speed on B12.)  So I will echo Greg.  Do them NOW!!! Do not wait!  I feel like we lost two years of potential development.  I could kick myself for not pushing for these earlier, and cry inside for what the last years could have been for my son.  I feel B12 was our biggest, most consistent wow next to the early stages of dietary intervention.      We do nasal B12, by the way, as my son is older, and almost recovered, and we had concerns about modesty issues.  If they had not worked so well, we would have gone to shots.  But we are fine with the nasal.    I would AT LEAST try the nasal, if you are really afraid.  But the shots are a much better bet.  Think of the potential gains!!

I never once referred to that question, ( I will give 75%  more at bedtime and 25% more for the first morning dose, to allow her to get  at least 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep). No I did not ask that, say to do that or anything of that nature. I said if I ACCIDENTLY miss ONE night dose I will keep going. When a child goes to school and you get one chance a week to do a round, I\'m not going to do nothing because I missed the 3am dose FRIDAY night, whole weekend down the drain, no round. I say no, just keep going on from there. Andy may not agree with that, but that is what I do (PERSONALLY).  I said a round DOES NOT HAVE TO BE 64 TO 78 HOURS That is what I have said more than once.</div>  You can\'t quote me from 11 years ago in a situation that was specific suggestions to an individual in an uusual situation as to how to make the best of the bad choices available to her, ignoring the many thousands of posts I\'ve made in between saying most people should NOT do that, and pretend it is an accurate representation of my views.  I do not recall any correspondence with CheriO.  I hear from a LOT of people so it may wel have happened, but I do not believe I wouild have failed to remember it if I made any suggestion that skipping the night doses was OK.    Your basic choices are:  you actually want your kid to get better, so you chelate them properly no matter what it takes; or  you don\'t care if your kid gets better, you just want to feel like you\'re trying, so you do whatever is convenient.  How to do it properly (roughly 3 day cycles, no missed doses, no substantial dosage variation, stop if you miss one) is well understood and has been clearly stated by many in this thread.  If you are having trouble with this, you need to stop chelating and spend some time thinking through the balance of your needs and your child\'s needs until you can figure out how to get yours satisfied AND also take care of his.  He needs to be chelated properly.  You have to do it - properly - but that doesn\'t mean it has to be unpleasant, difficult, or interfere with what you want to get out of life.  In the meantime, don\'t hurt other people\'s kids by pretending what you are doing is all right and encouraging them to chelate improperly.  Most mommies care enough about their kids to do whatever it takes to get them better, all they really need is good information.  They don\'t have to spend tens of thousands of dollars on DAN! doctors.  They don\'t have to have an affair with the doctor if they can\'t come up with the money.  They don\'t have to do anything expensive, immoral, or even particularly difficult.  They just have to get up for a few minutes at night a few times a week and do something that isn\'t any more difficult than going to the bathroom.  Most mothers of autisitc children wake up and go to the bathroom more times per week than they need to wake up to chelate the kid.  BTW, I have never said there was a problem with transdermal chelation as long as it was given adequately frequently - smearing it on the skin instead of swallowing it doesn\'t change the basic laws of nature regarding what the chelators do in your kid\'s body - you still have to give it every 3-4 hours (for DMSA or ALA).  Transdermal use however does make nighttime dosing even easier.

'<P>I am sorry to hear that. Personally, I don\'t think that this is something else.</P> <P> My parents split when I was 11, I did not have any special needs but my father(at the time) felt like I choose my mother over him(did not know that then) and he would not have anything to do with me. I became an very angry individual. I took it out on my mom. I blamed her even when deep down I knew it was not her fault. Have you ever heard that people take things out on the people they love the most. Know Why? Because, they know that those people will still be there in the morning and still love you no matter what you do. You have always been there for your son and he knows you will be there. </P> <P>When I was young, 12-13 I was still angry and I thought about killing myself several times but I had no real intention. I just thought if I did then nobody would have to worry about me (my mom) and I thought I was a waste, If my own Dad didnt care about me then I must be worthless. I can imagine it would be worse for a boy. We all want our parents approval. My Mom made excuses for my Dad for a while but finally she just told me the truth.(which at first I refused to believe). I had to see it for myself. The truth was he was drinking very heavily and really at that point did not care about anone or anything. It wasnt me, it was the drinking. </P> <P>She tried to save me that pain. In reality she should have gave it to me striaght the first time. I understand why she did just realize that I was going to have to face it anyway.</P> <P>Your son is angry, he\'s been abondaned(in his mind) by his father and he probably is blaming it on you out loud but inside he is blaming himself and his probelms, most likely because he believes that the things he has wrong with him drove his father away.</P> <P>Back down to earth, Tell your son the truth no matter how painful. If your x told you he was too busy. Then just tell him the truth.</P> <P>Exactly what is the truth? Think about it. Is your x just tired of it all? (dealing with your childs disabilities) Or is it something else entirely? (drugs, drinking, another woman,etc.) Do you really know? If you are unsure, Find out! Your son wants an answer. He wont like the answer he gets I am sure but he has to know.</P> <P>Does your XH know what his son said and why he is in the hospital? If he does and does not care, then just let him go. I would think the only thing he could do for your son is hurt him more. I would tell him how important it is for him to be more involved with his son, If he wont, there is nothing you can do about that.</P> <P>A word to the wise. From experience, I can tell you there is not a drug on the market to stop the pain in someones heart when they lose someone they love. Whether it be by death, divorce, or the person they love just gradually disappears from their life. No Drug on this earth can stop the pain your heart feels. I am sure your heart is still feeling pain. I hate the way things have turned out for you and your family. I wish there was something I could do, but there isn\'t.</P> <P>I can tell you this. Until your son knows the truth about Why wont his father return his calls or emails and why doesnt his father come and see him more often, stuf like that. He will continue to blame hisself and take it out on you and yes you get some of the blame too. His fahter is not there for him to be angry with, You are. Whatever the case may be, Ask the father the questions the son wants to know, I would insist that his father go to the mental hospital and tell him why. Hurtful or not. It is probably safer for your son to find out what he needs to know to move on in life in the MH than at home. I would guess that he will rage. I did looking back. Things were different then than they are now. Its only natural to be angry. Disabled or Not. I dont know a single person, child or adult, that did not get very upset when their parents split. It is hard on anyone.</P> <P>Also, take a little time and be good to yourself. You only done what was right for your son and it is NOT your fault things are going the way they are now. Don\'t blame yourself. You have other people doing that for you. Just take it a day at a time and just tell your son the truth. He will get mad. Maybe at you first. But, He has to know the truth whatever that truth might be. If he was doing fine before the split and since the split he has gotten worse. I think it would be safe to assume that the split is causing whatever he is going through. I would try to address his feelings while in the hospital and try to get you H to come to the hospital and talk to his son. They have visiting hours after work. If not I am sure the hospital social worker would be able to arrange a meeting.</P> <P>I know my post really does not help much but it touched my heart when I read it and I had to share with you.</P> <P>I carried anger in my heart for my father until 7 years ago when I forgave him for not being a father and we finally started talking again. The pain and anger is finally gone. When I was younger, I was angry and bitter for a couple of years but then again I didnt have a shoulder to cry on or lean on. So I buried those things way down and moved on with my life. I also realized it didnt matter if anybody else cared about me or my life. What really mattered is what I thought about myself and my life. I also(as a kid) decided they were not going to get what they wanted which at the time I felt like it was for me to disappear or die so they would not have to deal with me anymore. I decided I would do better than anyone ever said I could and I would not let bad things hold me down. And I didnt.</P> <P>Things will get better. Once you hit rock bottom there is nowhere to go but up. From your post it sounds to me as if you feel you have hit rock bottom.</P> <P>Chin Up! All of us here will support you and your son the best we can.</P> <P>My heart goes out to you and your son.</P> <P>Venus</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Venus</div>'

'Hi Linda!<br> I\'ve been away for awhile as well. I am sorry your daughter has been afflicted with schizophrenia. I know how heartbreaking that can be. My mother has the same thing. I was told that in her case it will only get worse as she gets older. My parents divorced and I was raised by my dad. When I was of age I began to visit her again and took over the role of being her caregiver. It didnot go well. Now I remain her caregiver but from a distance. She lives about 2 1/2 hours away from me but I am her only family contact. It is hard for my sisters to understand her mental illness.....so they don\'t have much to do with her.

'<font size=\"2\"> <br />OK I haven\'t written in a long time, so I thought I\'d throw something out there. This concerns the \"myth\" that people with autism don\'t like to be touched, hugged, or held. I have dealt with this subject before, but I want to include it in my composite link so I\'m posting it here. <br /> <br />This is my favorite myth of all, so I\'ll go after it before any others. But it is only my take and that\'s all, so here goes..... <br /> <br />The touch issue, to a large degree, is one of those things that is actually independent of autism. Some people like touching more than others. And that transcends all neurological conditions. However, because of the sensory issues and predictability requirements associated with autism, sometimes it can appear that an autistic child dislikes being hugged or held simply because they resist it on the first try. <br /> <br />So why then, would an autistic child resist physical contact when he actually wants or enjoys it? <br /> <br />Well, it goes back to keeping one\'s bearings and having all sensory inputs in order. Most adults, particularly parents, aunts, uncles, etc., will run up and hug their son/daughter, neice/nephew, grandson/granddaughter, etc. as soon as they see the child, often uttering loud, obnoxious (but loving) gibberish in the process. Unless the child is completely familiar with this response by that particular person, and has been adequately warned that he is about to encounter this person, this sudden rush of sensory input is going to scare the crap out of him because he didn\'t see it coming. The child may love aunt Bessie to pieces, and would happily curl up in her lap if she asks him to, but when she suddenly runs up on him talking baby talk and snatching him up to hug him, he will wince out of reflex, not because he doesn\'t love her and doesn\'t want to hug her, but because he has not had a chance to prepare for these new visual, physical, and auditory sensations. I often winced or pulled back when my grandmother, who I loved dearly, would come out of nowhere and hug me, but if my mom told me that we were about to see \"meemaw\" and that she\'ll want to hug my neck, then I was happy to jump into her arms as soon as I saw her. My mom was terrible about randomly tickling me, poking me playfully, patting me, etc. and I would always flinch every time. She always said she didn\'t understand why I didn\'t like to be touched, but she never realized that a poke, pat, or tickle is actually sensory input, and if I have not already factored it into my list of expected things to feel, the sudden touch will be unwelcome, regardless of how I feel about the person making the contact. <br /> <br />As a teenager and young adult, I have been looked up to by my younger cousins, as well as pretty much all other children I encounter, and they often want to hug me or play with me when they see me, which I have no problem with. But if you ever pay attention, you\'ll notice that I welcome the hugging, carrying, etc. only when I am expecting it. On the other hand, my favorite kid that I was just carrying around a few minutes ago can unexpectedly come up behind me and grab me or jump on me, and I will flinch and jump away as though the kid disgusted me or something. Once I realize it\'s him/her I will apologize and usually go ahead and hug them or whatever to let them know it\'s OK, because it wasn\'t the kid or the actual contact that upset me, but rather the unexpected sensory input that I had not yet prepared myself for. <br /> <br />In addition to that, there\'s also the issue of whether or not the message I send by engaging in physical contact is the same as what other people will interpret. In other words, if I feel sure that everyone witnessing this hug will interpret it the same way that I do, then I\'m OK with it and I will hug back, but if I\'m afraid I will be misinterpreted and \"painted\" incorrectly, I will shy away. For example, if my cousins are visiting and give me a hug in order to greet me, I pretty much know that everyone sees this hug as a greeting and nothing more. Thus I have no reservations about hugging back. On the other hand, if my brother\'s girlfriend goes to hug me as a greeting, I\'m going to be fuzzy on exactly how everyone will look at it. In this case I may allow her to hug me, but I will clearly not hug back in order to make it obvious that she is doing the hugging and not me. By remaining lifeless I leave nothing to talk about on my part, and it leaves me without the anxiety of wondering what everyone\'s opinion is. Also, by not comletely shying away I avoid creating a scene. It is neither a reflection of my friendship toward her in any way, nor a lack of desire for physical contact, but rather it is a defense mechanism designed to protect me from anxiety caused by needing to evaluate other people\'s feelings, which I am unable to read. <br /> <br />In conclusion, the odds of having an autistic person who truly does not like physical contact is going to be roughly the same as finding an NT person who does not like to be touched. It\'s just that the circumstances and stipulations regarding when touching is allowed are going to be entirely different when dealing with an autistic person. And understandably, people who are not used to dealing with autistics will not know how to interpret and recognize these alternate rules, thus creating the misconception that physical contact is a no-no. <br /> <br />So with regard to that, I would have to say that this myth is about 99% FALSE. There\'s no absolute certainty in my mind that there isn\'t that one child out there whose autism causes every bodily touch to result in sensory overload, but for the most part, we like human contact as long as it is kept within our realm of understanding. <br /> <br /><div class=\'post_sig\'>-   ~Nick   Still in touch with my inner child ;)</div>'

'<P>My son actually learned how to pee standing up in the shower. For the longest time he wanted to sit down, then one day I had him in the shower and encouraged him to try and pee. He did it and thought it was pretty fun. I gave him all sorts of kudos for it, then the next time he went to go potty I said, \"why don\'t you stand up like you did in the shower?\" He did, and that was the end of it. It also helped that everyday at school the teachers took all the boys to the bathroom at the same time and he watched them standing up (as well as watching daddy). So, he did get a lot of positive modeling before he actually decided to do this himself.</P> <P>Another you might consider is creating some visual cards that you place right above the toilet in the bathroom.

'<P>We parents do what we have to do. </P> <P>It is definitely true that the \"accepting\" school district in a cross-contracting situation NEVER has to accept a child from another district. This would be true even if you tried to send your child to another district in PA. The difference is that, if you live in NY, BOCES is not considered a cross-contracting situation. But since your child is a sort of \"visitor,\" he can be bumped. This has ALWAYS been true. It\'s just that it has taken until now for BOCES to decide that it no longer wants to take \"out of district\" kids. BOCES changes its rules whenever it wants to. And if this has come through the NY Legislature, there\'s really nothing that can be done. But the truth is, this did not have to come from the LEgislature. The \"hosting\" district (in this case, BOCES) just had to change its mind. I mention this so that parents who want to send their child into a public school in another district (cross-contract) realize that the drawback is that the placement can be reneged on at any time. Your own district cannot pull your child without changing the IEP, but the \"host\" district can simply stop hosting - without any reason given. Sorry.

' <div class=\"postbody\">BOYCOTT OF HORIZON DAIRY GENERATING NATIONAL PUBLICITY  The Organic Consumers Association\'s (OCA) call for a boycott of the nation\'s largest organic dairy brand, Horizon Organic has recently generated stories in the New York Times, USA Today, National Public Radio, and the Associated Press. The media coverage has highlighted the growing backlash by organic consumers against industrial scale dairy feedlots, who are misleadingly labeling their products as \"USDA Organic,\" even though the animals on these factory farms have little or no access to pasture. In addition, most of the cows on these giant feedlots have been imported from conventional dairies, where they were weaned on blood, injected with hormones and antibiotics, and fed genetically engineered grains and slaughterhouse waste. While Horizon sources half of its milk from family farms where the lactating cows do have access to pasture, Aurora Organic, OCA\'s other major boycott target, gets all of its milk from intensive confinement feedlots. Aurora sells its \"organic\" milk to supermarket chains including Costco, Safeway, Giant, and Wild Oats, who bottle it under their own private labels.

I have read much of the discussion related to toilet training and I want to congratulate all of you for your hard work!  I spent much of my graduate work researching toilet training for children with developmental disabilities. Toilet training is extremely difficult and take patience and a whole lot of orchestration.  I teach a life skills class for students in elementary school and have toilet trained kids up to about 12 years old.   I have had a lot of success when both home and school are on board.  I tell all of my families that consistency is the key.  The protocol I have used an found successful is very similar to what you have all described.  I suggest doing a reinforcement evaluation if you do not know what is absolutely the most reinforcing for your child.  That must be the coveted item when your child is successful!  However, have back ups and slightly less reinforcing items for good tries. Also, always be aware of where you child is.  However, if they are not interested or fearful of the toilet, reinforce for close proximity until your child is sitting on the toilet.  Space out the reinforcement one successful until your child eliminates in the toilet.  I take my students completely off of diapers/ pull ups (except for night time).  Their whole lives this is where they have been trained to go, doing this will take that comfort away.  I then suggest getting a 15 minute kitchen timer (dollar store people!!!!).  After 15 minutes do a pants check, if they are dry HOORAY!  Mini party for them!  If wet, with NO AFFECT direct them to the bathroom, say &quot;ugh oh, wet&quot; put their hands on so they feel and make the connection then have them help (as much as they can without increasing frustration too much) as they get changed.  Then spend 5 minutes on the toilet to make sure they are empty and start the 15 minutes over.  After 15 minutes of success, take to toilet and sing a little song.  For some students I reinforce with smaller reinforcement just for sitting on the toilet.  For others I bring out the big stuff when they have eliminated!  They are on the potty for 5 minutes or until success!  BIG PARTY after success and keep on going!  I have had kids trained in 2 weeks.  I have also learned over time that it happens when the child is ready.  Don\'t sweat it if they aren\'t ready!  I have had preschool teachers try the same protocol with no luck... a few years later, the kids are successful!   Keep trying!   You guys are doing great and feel free to ask questions!</div>'

'<P>We had a similar situation. Kids loved their drinks a night, especially my ASD son. R would wet occasionally, but C would wet 3 - 4 nights per week. This was never suprising to me since R is the light sleeper and C is the heavy sleeper.</P> <P>Last summer in August (boys were 5) and dh was traveling for a week and I just decided I\'d had enough of changing the entire bed each morning. I told the boys a BIG FAT LIE and it worked. I told them that I was so worried that they weren\'t waking up at night to go to the bathroom because it wasn\'t good for them to pee in the bed and get pee on their skin and get rashes (you get the idea) that I called the doctor and asked him what to do. I told the boys that the doctor said that they could no longer have drinks in their room at night. They bought it hook line and sinker. They grumbled for 2 nights or so and then it was fine. My dh was astounded to come home and find out I\'d managed to pull this off. Now the kids wet only rarely, maybe once per month, and only then when they\'ve been in an atypical situation (like my parents watching them) where they get more drinks than normal.</P> <P>We also bought a cute dixie cup dispenser that we put in their bathroom in case they need a sip in the middle of the night, but the rule is they have to go potty first if they want a drink. Sometimes they\'ll wake up in the night and call for a drink, which I\'ll get as long as potty first.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Kristy  Mom to 10 year old twin boys (1 PDD-NOS, 1 ADHD)</div>'

Echolalia is a part of autism but you can have it and not have autism, which is what your doctor seems to be saying. Is he getting enough speech therapy from the school system?    Yes, I know situations in which the parents thought autism and doctors said no. In one case, the doctor later changed his mind. In the other case, the child really didn\'t have autism.    It doesn\'t really matter what the diagnosis is, as long as you get treatment. If the child has speech problems, then speech therapy. If he has sensory problems, then occupational therapy. If developmental delays, then special education preschool to work on that.    What is meant by adaptive problems?     Good luck.</div>'

So as you can already imagine I am a believer in it.    My youngest son has \"cleared\" a lot of allergies, food and environmental. His seasonal allergies flared up again this spring, so we had to go back for a \"tune-up\". He still has HM toxicity, so as we detox his body, the allergies should be even less. He used to have eczema, it\'s gone.    My oldest does not have asthma anymore and sleeps well at night.     My middle one was a very picky eater. He is getting better, plus he does not get nearly the amount of stomachaches he used to get.     I was allergic to gluten, casein, soy. (confirmed through lab testing). My gaul bladder hurt every time I ate anything with gluten. My family doctor said to take it out.  I have had about 8 to 9 treatments so far. I can eat bread now!!!     I know the treatments did not work as well for a little girl I  know. I suggested NAET to her parents. They took her and she still has LOTS of issues (eczema, allergies, asthma). But her parents did nothing with her diet. She drinks pop, eats junk food. They did nothing else biomedically.     I believe NAET is part of the puzzle in the journey the road to recovery. NAET and homeopathy were instrumental in our oldest son\'s improvement.     Good luck with whatever you decide.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Lily</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Lily</div>'

'jobo - Of course you can write your own IEP goals. Just as ANY member of the IEP Team can. However, that does not mean that they will make it onto the final IEP anymore than anyone else\'s goals will. What goes on the document is what is supposed to be discussed and decided DURING the meeting. Of course, most of US know that, but the LAST person to know that is the Principal. Unless your state says otherwise, PRINCIPALS are not automatically part of the IEP Team. They are not generally invited. Of course, each case is different and there may be a REASON for the Principal to be there, but if you check IDEA 2004, Principals are not official IEP Team members. Some states may include them, though (NY does not), so it\'s worth checking your state\'s regs.'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Folks....  Sambazon sells a capsule form of acai that we have been using.  Each bottle has 60 capsules and sells for about 15 to 20 bucks (I can\'t remember exactly).  I give my guy 1 capsule in the morning.    I also take these capsules.  It can at first cause a little stomach upset, but I found this did not linger.  The capsules have a lot of fiber.  My son\'s enzymes may also help him digest, as he has not been complaining, etc...    These capsules are different from the other acai extracts I tried...  Seems to do the trick.  I have noticed that this supplement does appear to help him, similar to Mona Vie, etc... (I think).    In terms of costs, I think it\'s a pretty good option.  $15-20, 60 capsules, 2 months.  8-10 dollars a month...    Adam</div>'

I have a couple of friends that might be interested in combining our funds to share a chamber to rent.      I haven\'t called Rick back yet.  I guess the whole thing scares me a little.  I\'m a little nervous that I could do something wrong.  Plus I\'ll have to find out how much $$$ it cost to get trained.  Plane ticket or bus...., etc...

' <div class=\"postbody\">You may need to contact an advocate to work with you and EI.  That\'s what I would do -- especially if you struggle with the language!    Contact the ARC or Autism Society of America and ask them about an advocate to go to your IFSP meeting with you.  If you have already agreed to services, you can call another meeting and revise it.  What we have found is that the EI agency offers you as little as they think they can get away with and then tries to make you feel guilty about asking for more -- it\'s terrible.      An advocate can help you navigate the system and make some sense of it.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</div>'

After the adjustment, she basically cooked me <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /> with this hot iron.

I asked my hubby about it, and he had never heard of that.  So maybe this is something new that will start to help the muscles as well.  I was off my feet the next day very achy.  The next day, I felt great.  I haven\'t gone back for financial reaons, but can\'t wait to do it again.  I did take Gavin and Lindsey but don\'t think I will do it again.

'My son\'s class (mainstream) is taking a field trip. I only found out on <br />Friday , he has no school Monday, the field trip is Wednesday. The trip is <br />to a downtown metropolitan area, walking around as a group for about 3 <br />hours. <br />I have been on fieldtrips with this school before and supervision is spotty <br />- they don\'t assign kids to parents or teachers and everyone is supposed <br />to kind of watch everyone. Which works for NT kids I guess but not for <br />my son. His IEP says that on fieldtrips he needs to be supervised by his <br />parents or a teachers. I can not go this time. <br />So I sent an e-mail to his classroom and resource room teacher <br />reminding them of the provision in the IEP and reminding them that this <br />is necessary because he gets overstimulated in busy environments, he <br />tends to walk away from his group, at times he does not recognize people <br />he knows and he is too familiar with strangers. I asked them to let me <br />know which teacher will be responsible for him. <br />Knowing the school they will either ignore my letter or let me know that if <br />there are such safty concerns that he might not be able to go. <br />I want my son to go and I want the stupid school to get their act together <br />- what can I do on such a short notice ?<div class=\'post_sig\'>- micki, mom to three wonderful and wild kids.  ds 10 asperger & anxiety  twin dds 6 quirky but NT this far</div>'

Apparantly the liver strongly affects the skins condition.  I\'d also had adult acne also clearing up.  It is supposed to help for Psoriasis too.  It\'s amazing.    I\'ve also been thinking of starting a local support group I\'ve been trying to find one in my town and I don\'t think there is one.  I have been thinking that I would like it to encompass many topics.  But definately some biomed as well.  One thing I know intimidates people is thinking that cooking without gluten or casien has to taste bad when that is so not the case.  So what I\'d been thinking of doing was make a GFCF food to take with me each time.  I\'ve also gotten the gluten free gourmet does desert and made tha blue ribbon chocolate cake.  I found that Pilsbury frosting and cake mate colored icings are also GFCF.  So for my son\'s birthday I\'m inviting his autism class to his party and am not going to tell them that it is GFCF until after.  I also tested it out on a couple of my neighbors I am friends with and my hubby and no one could tell.  Which is my point cooking GFCF doesn\'t have to taste bad.  So anyway at his party I\'m going to see how many parents would be interested in a support group.  Our local library has rooms that a non profit organization can use for free.</div>'

Her conversations skills are not yet up to par and more abstract issues...she is in a preschool/prek setting so her services are still implemented in the summer but limited. She receives Speech and Language therapy twice a week 2hours a day...O.T once a week for an hour and special Instruter twice a week for 2hours. What I also think helped my dd is a social skills class which your insurance should cover. They social skills class that my dd went to also was therapeutic because the instructer was a speech and language therapist. Basically playdates with NT same aged peers and reading.

' <div class=\"postbody\">tbarb2020,    IMO he sounds in the right place. If he is only 3 and plays with peers when prompted, is learning and is not a behaviour problem I don\'t see why he should be moved.     If he were moved and he is not initiating play with peers then he would still have to be prompted.     Is the teacher wanting to move him because he is the only child with autism and therefore different from the other kids? I am wondering if the teacher percieves difference as a problem, what I think is that even if a child with autism is put with a class of other autistic children they will still be different from each other and you need to place your son where he is getting what he needs to learn. If he is playing with peers with prompting he is learning those skills and will probably move on the initiating interaction given time and opportunity.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thank you Tami!  We see our DAN doc next week and we are going to talk about chelation (that is unless Anna\'s EEG comes back bad and we have to start any seizure meds etc.)...I am wondering if our DAN will want us to start the NDF Plus separately and wait until we have been on one of the chelators before adding it?  What would you think - which would you start first or both at the same time?  ...and if only one, how long until we do both the rx chelator and NDF Plus?  My DAN has not used it before, but asked me to bring info on it - she is really open minded.      So: this was a perfect time for you to post this for me!!!

It has been tough, his yeast is out of control, though we are working on it and he seems to be feeling better.  The sensory is less, but still a little higher level of input than typical.  His poop is looking better, still some grit but I really feel that the grit is from chelation, and that it is toxins and metals releasing.  Tami has helped me figure that his calcium is low, so I am going to increase his cal/mag, and I am also switching from powder cal/mag to liquid to assure better absorption.  I have also been lucky in getting the caprylic acid in him, and have given activated charcoal the last 2 nights before bed to suck up all the toxins being released from the yeast as the die.  He is tired, and frustrated, but bless his little heart he is trying hard to get through the day without issue, no tantrums!      I am going to go ahead with the TD DMSA this week, Lee Silsby said it was fine to continue, so hopefully by then he will have some of his energy back or he is REALLY going to be a tired mess!

NEVER use the word best in your communication with the school about your son. NEVER. Train yourself to use the word \"appropriate.\" What appropriate has come to mean after 30 years of IDEA and many, many court cases is \"adequate.\" Of course \"adequate\" is no more definite than \"appropriate.\" In the light of the fact that IDEA 2004 has been aligned with NCLB, \"appropriate\" is going to come to mean that a child will meet the same school standards that are required of ALL kids. That is exactly what No CHild Left Behind says. It says that ALL children, including special ed. kids, will meet state education standards. I forget by what year. It will be in your child\'s school life, definitely. That is actually going to increase what \"appropriate\" means. But right now it means more than minimum and less than best. That is the LEGAL definition. What that REALLY means is what we fight over all the time.</P> <P>At your son\'s age, there are not state standards because he is not school age yet. HOwever, his IEP serves at the standard. Skills have to be learned \"across all environments.\" So the fact that he doesn\'t do these things across environments means he has not mastered his goals. Take a close look at the goals. They may have been written very vaguely. They should be observable and measurable. Have the teacher SHOW you how your son can do on each goal. If you like, copy the goals here and we can discuss them.</P> <P>The truth is, if you pull him out of school, he won\'t be getting an appropriate education, either. You can certainly get him more therapy thru your insurance and/or you can use outside testing to prove to the school that they are not doing a great job. But your son\'s future is in a school. Lots of social goals cannot be worked on except in that environment. Separate what is potentially good about his being in school from what needs to be changed or addressed in some way. If you are thinking about pulling him after only one month, look closely at your own feelings about school- whether it\'s appropriate or not. Many of us are reluctant to let our babies go. That\'s a natural feeling on our parts. But our children can\'t afford the luxury of just hanging out at home. Of course, they should never be subjected to a school environment that is not helping them meet their goals, either. Try to get this situation to improve. Even if you have to access professional support. It will be an investment in your child\'s future. If these are the characters you are going to have to deal with for the next upteen years, make friends. Establish as good a relationship as you can. Help create a cooperative environment with the IEP team. Put out any fires now, but give the situation some time to develop at school. It may not get any better, but over time you may be able to fix it. After only one month, no one will listen thinking this is still the shake-down period. </P> <P></td> </tr> </table></td> </tr> </table></td> </tr> </table> </P> <P>I know that a lot of stuff you are saying is true. It\'s just too exhausting face it. I have a call into the school systems parent liason. She leads our PAC council so she knows who I am. I am still waiting for a call back.

I know someone who works in special ed and she says it <br />is very common that when a school has decided that they do not want a <br />student for whatever reason they will just wear the parents down with <br />numerous phonecals and e-mails until they leave \'voluntarily\'. I hope that <br />there is a special place in hell for them. But living well is the best revenge <br />- don\'t waste any more time and thoughts on them. The amazing news is <br />that your ds still made academic progress even with all that hostilty and <br />harrasment. He must be a special and resiliant little guy. The year my ds <br />had the hostile teacher I don\'t think he learned much, his brain just shut <br />down.

'Nupar, I have an 11 year old son with Asperger\'s who is in his first year of <br />middle school. You should know, that agression in Aspie\'s is rare, but it <br />is the one aspect that the media has latched on to, thus the perception <br />that agression is an Aspie trait. My son and niece are both Aspie\'s, and <br />neither are aggressinve. My beautiful niece is a junior in high school, <br />fully mainstreamed with a 504 plan that allows her to take math tests at <br />home, and a few other classroom modifications. After a hellish time in <br />middle school from a social standpoint, she is blossoming in high school, <br />and has a small, close knit group of friends. Her main weekness is <br />organization, an Aspie trait. My DS is going through the social angst of <br />middle school, and getting better and better about dealing with it. He is <br />fully mainstreamed for all subjects expect English, which he takes with <br />the autism teacher because he has learning disabilities in the areas of <br />language processing and written language. Because of his learning <br />disabilities, he has required a 1:1 aide since the third grade. He gets all <br />A\'s and B\'s, and I couldn\'t be prouder. Both were dx\'d relatively late. My <br />niece was 10, DS 7, and both were thought to be ADD before they were <br />dx\'d (DS actually is ADD as well). Both are highly intelligent with IQ\'s in <br />the high 130\'s, and test well within the normal range in both life and <br />adaptive skills. We expect them both to be able to go to college, though <br />we will have to choose carefully, and they will need the support of either <br />an Asperger\'s/HFA or Learning Disabilities program in order to be <br />successful. They are terrific kids, who just happen to be a little quirky, <br />and not just like everyone else!<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Karen - Connor, 15, Asperger\'s, ADD & LD & Raymie, 8, NT</div>'
'<H1>Basic Guidelines for Choosing an Attorney to represent your child\'s interests in Special Education</H1> <P>If you have a child with a disability, you may find that you need legal support to get the educational services your child needs. Attorneys who have licenses to practice law provide legal advice, help and support; they can represent you in court and in due process hearings. Licensed lawyers are accountable to strict rules of legal procedure and ethics. </P> <P>Like all other attorneys, special education attorneys may be in private practice or they may practice in a public service agency such as a Protection and Advocacy agency, Legal Aid, Legal Clinic, or other similar organizations. You can find attorneys by calling your state bar association, local bar association, or local disabilities organizations. You can also ask other parents in your local area about attorneys they have used. The Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, Inc. (COPAA) also has an attorney locator available on its Web site at <A href=\"http://www.copaa.org/find/index.php\" target=\"_blank\"><FONT color=#810081>http://www.copaa.org/find/index.php</FONT></A>. </P> <P>Choosing an attorney is an important decision. Attorneys\' styles vary just as parents\' styles do. Choose an attorney who is the most compatible with your personality and objectives. This basic guide will help you as you select an attorney who will be helpful.</P> <P>Please keep in mind that before an attorney can answer some of your questions, the attorney may want to review your child\'s education records and other related records. </P> <P>At the end of these Guidelines you will also find suggested questions that consumers of legal services should consider asking any attorney they are considering working with.</P> <H1>Guidelines</H1> <P><strong>Consider the attorney\'s special education expertise and knowledge</strong></P> <P>The law in special education cases can be complex. Although the training lawyers receive prepares them to deal effectively with legal complexities, law schools commonly do not teach special education law as a specific body of law. Attorneys who practice special education law should have suitable training and experience in this field. You want to make sure that they have the special education law experience you are looking for. </P> <P>Find out if the lawyer you are considering routinely handles special education cases. Good lawyers in other fields of law often become motivated to begin practicing special education law. Special education lawyers also may be parents of children with disabilities. Knowledge and experience in other fields of law is one feature of an attorney\'s practice that may be important. Ideally, attorneys who help parents in this field should know the various federal and state laws and regulations about disabilities, civil rights, and special education. Special education attorneys should also know the current special education court decisions from the federal and state courts as well as their state\'s administrative decisions. </P> <P><strong>Select an attorney with the special education experience you need</strong></P> <P>Practicing special education law and resolving special education conflicts calls for many different skills. Special education lawyers routinely conduct simple negotiations, mediations, administrative hearings (called \"due process hearings\"), or go to court for their clients. Consider the experience the attorney has in each of these areas. Ask the attorney about his or her experience. You should feel free to ask the attorney for references. You are the one making the hiring decision.</P> <P>Special education lawyers should be familiar with the local service providers, evaluators, local school districts and the special education administrators in the school districts. They should also have knowledge of local customs and the education optional choices that are available. They should know about evaluations, IEP issues and details, disabilities, behavioral supports, discipline issues, document management, fact investigations, formal and informal negotiations for needed services, and other areas that are common to special education cases. A lawyer should be familiar with the state\'s due process hearing procedures, hearing officers, mediation process, and the process for filing a complaint with the state. If you think you may go to federal court over a dispute, the lawyer should be familiar with federal court procedures and know about the local courts.</P> <P><strong>Possible outcomes of the case</strong></P> <P>Each special education case is unique because each student\'s particular educational needs are unique. In addition, special education cases may include dynamics that other law cases do not. However, an experienced special education attorney should be able to review your child\'s education records and give you a range of possible outcomes. A lawyer will help you carefully weigh the advantages and the disadvantages of your case. Do not expect an attorney to guarantee you an outcome.</P> <P><strong>Ask how the attorney charges for his or her work</strong></P> <P>You should not hesitate to ask attorneys what their rates are and how they will bill you for professional services. Most attorneys will not begin work without an agreement, sometimes called an engagement agreement or letter. Attorneys should tell you about what you can expect. They should tell you what the extent of their representation is going to be (what they are going to do for you). They should also tell you about how they set their fees; what is expected of you in terms of paying for expenses; whether they work by the hour or whether they will work on a flat rate basis; what the retainer (if any) will be used for; and their terms of engagement.</P> <P><strong>Understand your role as parents</strong></P> <P>Parents play a vital role in every special education case. Lawyers cannot make decisions for you. They can give you legal advice and tell you what to expect. But you, as parent of the student, are responsible for making the decisions. You must decide whether to accept or reject an IEP, whether to settle your conflict with the school informally and what the terms of a settlement will be, and other such decisions. An attorney can give you advice and opinions based on that attorney\'s training and experience, but you make the final decisions about your child\'s case.</P> <P><strong>Find out if the attorney has support staff who will assist with your case</strong></P> <P>Sometimes, support personnel who work for the lawyer may help with your case and help deliver legal services. This can help keep fees lower. </P> <P>Support personnel are often paraprofessionals such as paralegals, nurses, former educators, and so forth. Ask the attorney to explain the support personnel\'s role in your case. If the attorney is using a paraprofessional such as a lay advocate, the attorney should tell you how they supervise the paraprofessional. </P> <H1>Suggested Questions for Consumers of Legal Services</H1> <P>These are questions you should consider asking at the first meeting:</P> <UL> <LI>What experience does the lawyer have in your particular legal matter? <LI>Request a preliminary outline of how the lawyer believes the case should be handled and the time frame to complete the matter <LI>Does the lawyer carry malpractice insurance? <LI>How can or will you be expected to take part in your case? <LI>How will your lawyer keep you informed about the status of the matter? <LI>Ask if the lawyer will provide you with a fee agreement that details fees, expenses, billing and payment. <LI>Ask for the lawyer\'s hourly fee (if applicable). <LI>Ask for an estimate of the lawyer\'s total fee. </LI></UL> <P>Some lawyers charge for your first consultation, and some do not. </P> <P>After meeting with the lawyer ask yourself if you: </P> <UL> <LI>Will be comfortable working closely with this person <LI>Are confident the lawyer has the experience and skill to handle your case <LI>Understand the lawyer\'s explanation of what your case involves <LI>Understand the proposed fee agreement </LI></UL>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Just wanted to share quick update.   And for those doing the AC protocol, You are also encouraged to share a snippet where you are.  I think that way we may get to know another better.   Besides those who are considering the protocol  can see the AC protocol modeled  so there is no more understudying what it actually entitles.   Btw this week my kiddo will be 13 and we have completed to date  #183 rounds thus so far . Yea!!  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />    As a reminder my son hit a stall period somewhere about rounds 80-100 in chelation. Since then it has been hard to tell gains because we hit so many miles stones within the first year of chelation.  Now considering my sons age, it is  always hard to see big stuff. One reason he is very social  with lots of  expressive  language .. To top it off  and the last few years he has developed quite a personality.   In the last year we have taken many breaks, but each time a after picking back up and getting a few more rounds under the belt we have seen some stuff. Breaks are good but often times you never know till you get a block of rounds together and look back . Often times we forget how far we came because  of what  issues we are currently   dealing with.    The gains that we see now are mostly in regard to his mature level and independence. O yea the last thing I have noticed is he now expressing his right to do what he wants to do because he is going to be a teenager.  Yea Mr  bossy  pants lolâ€¦â€¦and he getting too big for spanking . So now its learning reasoning and making wise choices.    Please pray for us as we enter puberty. I heard it could be a little tricky as their body is going through all those changes.

The spacing for the scores on the right column is a little off, so you need to shift them down one row (it may just be my computer screen, though, so take a look at it for yourself). You can see the percentile for each of the four categories as well as for the overall score. From what I have read, the scoring may not be accurate for very young children. I read that a toddler who is not on the spectrum could score around 7 and that a an older child who is not on the spectrum could score around 4 (these are the scores, not the percentiles). Sorry, I read about it a long time ago and do not remember what the resource was that described these numbers, so they could be a little off.    I started tracking my son\'s scores a month before he started biomed and have been following his scores for about 1 1/2 years. The scores dropped dramatically at the beginning.

Your child needs to be restrained in the seat with a seatbelt at the appropriate times (takeoff, landing, etc.).

This made headlines because the family brought it to the news hoping for sympathy and 80% of people surveyed felt the airline did the right thing (plane was already 15 minutes late at the time). You can google \"airline tantrum\" and see all the press on this.</P> <P>2. You can give him Benadryl to calm him down and make him sleep. I heard about this anecdotally from others but wasn\'t going to drug my kids just because someone at work suggested it. I called my pediatrician and asked straight out if it was safe to drug C with Benadryl for the flight. He laughed and told me that we should never \"drug our kids.\" However, the dry air on the plane often makes kids cough and that we \"couldn\'t go wrong by giving him some Benadry as a preventative measure.\" We both struggled to keep a straight face!</P> <P>3.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello all  I am concerned about my son and I am looking for some help.  My son has always been kinda strange.  He started talking late and he isn\'t very social.  But I haven\'t really given it much concern.  Both his father and I are non social people so I figured that he just inherited it from us.  He is an only child, so it really wasn\'t an issue until kindergarten started.  But once he started school he began having major behavior problems.  Our son would have hour long tantrums and kick and bite the other kids.  We certainly didn\'t teach him that.  No matter how much we try to discipline him it kept happening.  So we pulled our child out of kindergarten, hoping that another year would mature him and fix the problem.  Now first grade has started and he is still having the same problems.  The school wants to put him into a emotionally disturbed classroom and also put him on medication.  I am very opposed to this but I don\'t know what to do about it.  He doesnt have any serious problems at home aside from the typical childish behaviors.  This problem is just happening at school.  We talked with the school therapist who suggested that we have our son evaluated for autism.  At first I thought she was crazy, but after browsing the web and reading some information I am beginning to suspect something is wrong.  My son has several odd behaviors that I thought were just part of his unique personality.  But after reading about autism, I believe that they might be symptoms of autism.  Needless to say I am very concerned and I am looking for any information to read about how to deal with these problems and what to do about school and all the other things like that.  Does anybody have any recommended reading material that is designed for confused parents who are new to the diagnosis and are in need of help understanding it?</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I guess I should ask you to clarify, when you say you want to make language more of a focus, do you mean speech or communication?    FWIW, I actually see the order of which receptive/expressive are taught as rather important.  I think if <em>communication</em> is the desired goal, Verbal Behavior is a better alternative.  Go check out Behavioral Interventions for Young Children with Autism or the ME book and see how many programs deep you get before a child is actually taught communication.  I think language/speech is uselss unless it\'s functional.  If you look at Behavioral interventions or the ME book, a child learns matching, NVI, sorting, body parts, and imitates actions with objects before he even learns how to point for a desired item....not saying every consultant follows this exact sequence    ETA that I re-read your post and think I misunderstood.  From everything you have described here about Aidan, he seems like he has a lot of spontaneous language and is very naturally curious and eager to learn - I think if your\'re just trying to expand the language he\'s using (not necessarily the function), then your team could easily implement additional goals without fundamental changes to your program.  I guess my response was a knee-jerk one, having a child who actually has a very good receptive lexicon, yet a not so functional expressive vocabulary - I would of course take some issue in what order receptive language was taught.  Is Aidan asking wh questions?</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I\'m no medical person, but I have read that eye gaze problems are fairly common in autism spectrum disorders (not saying your child has ASD though!). It is a sensory problem. Some kids only look out of the corners of their eyes at things or people. Some seems to stare into the corners of a room rather than look at something straight on. Some kids have improved their eye gaze by taking natural Vitamin A through cod liver oil. If you try that, be careful not to give too much. Vitamin A is something you don\'t want to overdose. I also have heard of optometrists who work on eye exercises of some sort to help a child with visual problems. Good luck.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Just me thinking here:    The diagnosis of ASD is a very imprecise science. I\'m a bit dubious when they start to diagnose people on the spectrum and it being based on NT = medium extrovert, medium imagination, medium logical, medium etc etc  then the belief that anything personality wise or intelligence wise that is out side of the mid range is varying degrees of dysfunctional. There is a growing tendency to diagnose mathematical, logical, introvert, anxious, quirky people as autistic or rather being on the \"spectrum\".      With my son he turned 4 last month. He is very intelligent (father is a mathematical engineer type guy), systematic, looks for patterns same, different, likes playing around with concepts, is an introvert (both mom and dad are introverts) he has also had bad gut, allergies, asthma, eczema. Even though I am now getting my sons medical problems under control he is not going to be the mythical NT because he is very intelligent he adds on his fingers up to 15, he was starting to read at 2 and now reads well and understands what he reads (not rote) I can see the parts of my son that are dysfunctional (there are not as many now as there were) and the parts of him that are just personality.      At my sons preschool they have the perception that my son is autistic BECAUSE he doesnt want to play firemen with the other kids or play in the sandpit, when I was parent help I saw him trying to talk to another child about the number puzzle that he likes, the other child didn\'t know the numbers and was saying the wrong ones and my son was trying to tell him what they were and was frustrated that he didn\'t know. He is very stubborn and opinionated and is going through a controlling stage.  I think these are personality issues not autistic spectrum issues.      I know that the thinking at the moment is that autism is a spectrum disorder  I am starting to think that that isnt a good analogy. I think there are sub groups of different causes that produce a variety of symptoms and some of the sub groups can overlap and do.     I am getting a bit frustrated at the implication that because there is anxiety, OCD tendencies, mathematical ability in family histories that means that they were basically autistic or rather on the \"spectrum\".    DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR ASPERGER\'S DISORDER (DSM IV)      A. Qualitative impairment in social interaction,      as manifested by at least two of the following:        1) marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviours such         as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures          to regulate social interaction;        2) failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental         level;        3) a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests or         achievments with other people (eg: by a lack of showing, bringing,          or pointing out objects of interest to other people);        4) lack of social or emotional reciprocity.    B. Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests,     and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following:        1) encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and         restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity          or focus;        2) apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines         or rituals;        3) stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (eg: hand or finger         flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements);        4) persistent preoccupation with parts of objects    C. The disturbance causes clinically significant impairment in social,     occupational, or other important areas of functioning.    D. There is no clinically significant general delay in language      (eg: single words used by age 2 years, communicative phrases used by      age 3 years).     E. There is no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or in     the development of age-appropriate self-help skills, adaptive behaviour     (other than social interaction), and curiosity about the environment in     childhood.    F. Criteria are not met for another specific Pervasive Developmental     Disorder, or Schizophrenia.      failure to develop<strong> peer relationships appropriate to developmental        level</strong>;  If you get kids who like trains they will play fight about those trains they are peers because they like the same things and are at the same development level     If you get a budding math kid very intelligent who loves math and put him/her with peers (other kids who like math) they will play fight argue about that. There is a growing belief that system and math is the dysfunction whereas it is the lack of recirocity with people who share your interests ie are your peers. Introversion is starting to be an autistic trait whereas the austistic trait is more the inability to communicate appropriately     <strong>marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviours such        as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures         to regulate social interaction  </strong></div>'

'First of all, welcome to the board! This is a great place that has lots of support and great advice from many members. <br><br>Second, does your son have an IEP? Does he receive OT services under that IEP? I would think that some sensory work would be in order and that the OT should be working with the classroom teacher on these issues. <br><br>Also, do you have an autism specialist working with him or observing him? This would be a person who should consult with the teacher as well. I would want that person to be observing him in the classroom and taking down data several times to help figure out what is going on - I\'ll write a bit more on that later.<br><br>What exactly is an emotional support classroom? Is that like an EBD classroom? If so, that is probably not a great placement for your son. EBD teachers are more likely to see kids who try to manipulate and not have as much training or experience with kids on the spectrum. It is not a good sign that she is saying that he is doing this on purpose. <br><br>I would call an IEP meeting and make sure the principal or director of Special Ed is there. I would also bring an advocate, if you can find one. If there are behavioral issues (like meltdowns), ask for an FBA (functional behavioral analysis) so that the team can make a BIP (behavioral intervention plan). I am not an expert in these areas - but there are people on the board who will chime in I\'m sure if you have questions about the FBA or BIP. You want an FBA done in order to figure out what is triggering the meltdowns. If it shows that it is sensory - then they will have to figure out what to do in order to give him the proper sensory input. Until that point, it is your word against hers and since it is her classroom - she will continue to believe how she wants to, unfortunately.<br><br>I\'m sorry you\'re going through this - it is sad that a professional just doesn\'t \"get it\".

Retard. 2005;110:417-38), 23 children with autism received 4 years of ABA. 11 of them were able to attend regular classes and scored normally on tests of IQ, language, adaptive functioning and personality. Of those 11, 7 seemed recovered but 3 needed an assistant due to attentional issues and 1 would probably still meet ASD criteria.</FONT></P></TD> <TD align=right><FONT size=2></FONT></TD></TR></T></TABLE> <P><FONT size=2>3) Dr. Fein published a report in 2005 (J. <B style=\"COLOR: black; : #a0ffff\">Autism</B> Dev. Disord. 2005;35:525-34) where 11 children with ASD ended up at age 6-7 with clear-cut ADHD with mild residual features of autism, \"such as social awkwardness (but more impulsive and immature than aloof), perseverative interests, and occasional mild motor stereotypies.\" There are three possible explanations for this:</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>... Maybe these kids had both ASD and ADHD all along.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>... Maybe they had a severe subtype of ADHD that presents as </FONT><FONT size=2> autism in early childhood. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>... Maybe attentional impairment is the most stubborn feature of ASD, and remains when social, behavioral and communication problems subside.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>4) In an ongoing study by Dr. Fein, she looked at 77 children who screened positive on the M-CHAT at age 2 and were seen again at age 4. Of the 16 who screened positive for reasons other than autism, none of them had autism at age 4 either. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>Of the 61 who screened positive on the M-CHAT because of autism, 15 had moved off the spectrum. <strong>The only difference between those who moved off the spectrum and those who remained were significantly higher motor skills (!).</strong> Otherwise, communication, socialization, symptom severity and cognitive ability were the same at age 2. Yet the recovered sub-group reached \"almost normal levels\" on all those measures at age 4. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>5) In another study (not yet published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders when the article was written), Dr. Fein looked at 14 kids who had been diagnosed with ASD in the past, but were of normal intelligence and functioning at peer-level in mainstream classes. These high-functioning kids had normal performance on many measures, including different aspects of linguistic ability, expressive vocabulary, and sentence memory, and had adaptive skills in communication and socialization.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>During the first evaluation, when this group of kids fell between ages 5 and 9, they had some limited impairments: </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>... trouble reasoning about animate objects (not including people). </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>... trouble producing good narratives, leaving out major events and characters\' motivations. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>... trouble with \"second order theory of mind\" situations, such as knowing \"what does Johnny know that Suzie knows about what Rick thinks.\"</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>... trouble knowing the difference between mental state verbs (know, guess, estimate)</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>At follow-up visits when the group was 9-12 years of age, the only impairment left was the last item, mental state verbs! </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>Why are some able to recover? Fein doesn\'t think misdiagnosis is likely, at least not for the kids in her own studies. It is a special combination of intervention and personal characteristics? Or is it a subtype of autism, perhaps one with minimal structural brain abnormalities?

(migraine))<BR>1:10 Back to SpEd class.<BR>2:30 Another sensory break...uses bathroom<BR><BR>Mon, Wed, every other Friday...there\'s Gym<BR>Tues, Thurs, every other Friday...there\'s Music<BR>Tues, Thurs Speech from 11:00-11:30<BR>Mon. OT from 11:00-12:00<BR>From Nov 1-17 Mon-Thurs. 12:20-12:40...additional math instruction<BR><BR>IT\'S TOO MUCH CHANGE....<strong><U> I </U></strong> can barely keep track. They\'ve created all his schedules for him...but just that moving around so much I knew was going to get to him....and he needs more 1:1 in math, it\'s his toughest subject, and I knew it would be a problem. <BR><BR>So anyway...he\'s picked up a few behaviors this year that he never had before:<BR>~Flaps his arms during transition times<BR>~This whole face-rubbing thing<BR>~When it\'s sunny, he has to have a hat, so inside, they\'re not consistent about making him put it away, so as he walks through the hallway, Hat on, Hat off, Hat on, Hat off.....you get the jist!<BR><BR>I think I\'m going to get him some \"fidget toys\" (is that what they\'re called?) But I\'m not sure that will even work, again, I don\'t think he \"realizes\" what he\'s doing. You know, maybe I\'ve just made the case for keeping him from this whole back-and-forth routine?

' <div class=\"postbody\">Saw this on the chronis fatigue site ...     NAC (N-acetyl L-cystiene) is a widely available glutathione precursor that has the ability to directly bind and excrete mercury via its single thiol (sulfur atom) as well as support and increase the body\'s store of glutathione as a precursor.     Now your body can make ALA ??? didn\'t know that. maybe time to add it in ... maybe autistic kids have low ALA to start with.    The nutrient ALA (alpha lipoic acid) is a dithiol (with 2 sulfur atoms) compound that is normally used by the body in small amounts as part of the enzymes for producing cellular energy. Because of its two sulfurs, ALA can bind and transport mercury for excretion from the body.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I have to say that to me, these aspects are very atypical of an ASD:    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">does tons of pointing at things that he wants and points to get my attention, looking at the object and then looking at me to see my expression. His receptive language is pretty good, he understands 2 languages because we are a bilingual family.</div>  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">He can play independently, but he also will bring us some toys to show something</div>  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"> has great eye contact and responds to his name. He is actually very social, waving Hi and Bye to strangers</div>    I think these are very important points, much more important than the expressive language.   Being raised bilingual is commonly associated with speech delays especially in boys (unfortunately, the bilingual thing applies to us as well, which led to a delay in diagnosis).     Incidentally- my autistic son never flapped at that age, but my very typical daughter flapped like there was no tomorrow around that age (she is 26 months now and I\'m not seeing it any more).    This said, if you have a gut feeling, and given how wide the spectrum is, you should pursue it of course.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ \"When many cures are offered for a disease, it means the disease is not curable\" -Anton Chekhov</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ \"When many cures are offered for a disease, it means the disease is not curable\" -Anton Chekhov</div>'

How could she possibly NOT get excited about something like his desire to collect the box tops to get the CD!  He initiated the communication and communicated a want to you.  Very big steps in an autistic child.  I would also follow your instincts.  You might want to look into PRT which is a program that is based on ABA and is supposed to help them learn some basic underlying behaviors so that the more complex behaviors can come more easily.  But it doesn\'t teach one skill at a time like ABA which is ok for teaching consistent behaviors like waving and saying bye when someone leaves.  But for more complex social interactions this one is supposed to help.  Pivotal Response Training PRT.</div>'

'<P><FONT face=\"Courier New, Courier, mono\">Can\'t tell you what to expect for sure on that one. Ds used to do that a lot and also bite himself. He has stopped doing it in the last mth or so. We are so pleased. He still throws a heck of a tantrum, but has pretty much stopped purposefully hurting himself. We know he could possibly go back to it too though. He has stopped behaviors that have resurfaced weeks or mths later. Or new ones that are worse than the ones he stopped emerge lol. So your child may hang on to this one for awhile, or it might be gone in a week. I am told by dr that w/ asd things can happen in spurts. That is why some may see improvements for weeks or longer and then wonder why their child seems to fall back to where they were before. Then later have another spurt. Just try not to condone the behavior. Unless he is really hurting himself or someone else ignore him and don\'t give in if possible. I know we tried to not condone it and that may have been why he stopped, I\'m not sure. He still sometimes lightly bites himself when too excited. But I\'ll deal with that rather than the other.

Our son would be nowhere without Risperdal. But what works for an individual child depends on the individual child. Each child is his own, personal experiment. None of these meds are tested on children with the result that our OWN children become guinea pigs. But I\'ve found that medicating my son under the watchful eye of an expert has given us a healthy, happy young man who is making very good progress. </P>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Vanessa,    It\'s a tough time to deal with bills due to the economy and all, and I understand your frustration. We couldn\'t afford speech and OT either and our insurance never covered these things. Since we couldn\'t afford this, we made it our mission to get the school system to provide speech and OT. It took a lot of work -- and IEP meetings -- and I was never happy with the amount we got, but we did get some from the school. It is our kids\' right to the services they need! Even if you homeschool, you\'re entitled to these services if your child needs them!    Supplements can be expensive, but do you know which are vital, which are OK and which aren\'t doing anything for your child? I started a bunch of supplements at once and didn\'t know which were helping until I tried an experiment. I took one away at a time for a month to see if anyone noticed anything. Some of the supplements really weren\'t doing anything at all. I also discovered as part of my cost-cutting that the health food store probiotics worked just as well at Kirkman\'s at one-third of the cost.  The enzymes really weren\'t necessary as long as we were strict with the diet. So I save a bundle there, too.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">School has always been really tough for us.  I have had to fight for so much, or maybe I should say, \"so little\".  Basically, my son is the first child they have had that is non-verbal, extremely sensory, and at times aggressive.  Many MANY times over the years they all have been at a complete loss and have said that they just do not know what to do.  I taught them ABA, SI, talked about the modifications that work at home (why reinvent the wheel), and have spent a great deal out of pocket on supplies for school such as weights, bumpy seats, manipulatives for math/reading/self help/spelling etc., and have also purchased augmentative devices, pecs, schedule boards, etc..  I also had to teach them ASL, joint compressions and Wilbarger protocol.      Aren\'t they supposed to be helping us?    So much time, effort and money has gone into school, and yet they still are confused.  They are fine as long as he sits and performs.  When he is sensory and overwhelmed, it throws them off and I surely will be getting that phone call.  We all know that call, \"We need to have an immediate meeting to discuss recent behaviors.  Can you come in to school today.\"  URGH!!    I have spoken to everyone in the district, every teacher, specialist, psychologist, even the superindendent.    I feel like I am getting nothing, no assistance.  Did I mention that speech and OT are worthless too?  The speech teacher is always mad, she is one of those teachers that is always yelling at someone and makes you cringe at the thought of your child having anything to do with her.  The OT is new and my son is still testing her and she is clueless as to how to take control.    I want to homeschool, I have always wanted to, but have been trying so hard to give my son the \"school experience\" but am not so sure anymore that it is the most appropriate setting for him.  He is SOOOO sensory and I know his sensory needs best and how to meet his needs.  Our house has more equipment than school and is his most comfortable setting.  He has so very little peer interaction at school, he has more peer exposure/interaction after school outside and on weekends.    Has anyone tried school for a half day and homeschool/ABA the other half?  Or just ABA/homeschool full time??    I do not want to make a serious decision when I am upset or frustrated, which I am right now.  But I really would like to hear if anyone else has been in a similar situation and how they resolved it.  ANY advice is greatly appreciated.

'I think the reason your therapist wants you to give him choices only one of which he would consider taking is that she thinks this will train him to \"get\" the idea of choice. But to make a real choice, he will eventually have to choose between two equally desireable things. By giving him a choice between applesauce and a carrot, you\'ve essentially made the choice for him. That is probably appropriate now, since he doesn\'t understand what you mean about making a choice or simply can\'t make a decision. But when he gets to the point of being capable of that, what you were doing initially is the way to go. Giving a choice means to give a true CHOICE. Giving a child options that are equally desirable to you frees him to make HIS choice. Hopefully, your little boy will be able to do that as he develops further.<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\">'
'<P>Negative behavior only has to occur ONCE for you to be able to ask for an FBA.</P> <P>I would call the Superintendent and meet with him to express your concern that your son was not allowed to eat AT ALL. I SERIOUSLY doubt this was the literal case. It may be that he didn\'t want to eat unless he was in the cafeteria or that, perhaps, he misconstrued what the punishment was supposed to be about and DIDN\'T eat because he THOUGHT he was not allowed to. NO CHILD CAN BE DEPRIVED OF FOOD AS A PUNISHMENT! Get to the bottom of this. And get IN WRITING what actually happened.</P>'

'UPDATE:<br><br>After less than 1 week we caved. I spent over 2 hours in the darkened room with him and he treated it like a game the whole time.

He settled down a couple of minutes after that. <br><br>BTW - she got him to sleep the night before in 45 minutes which I think is because she always put him to bed before, but with this new pattern developing she\'s gotten frustrated as well and passes it off to me because she has to get up early in the morning for work.

'<P>Just a heads-up. Apparently, some states are moving over the next year to do away with the OHI classification, making it necessary to reclassify the children under that category into a more specific category, and/or making it more difficult for children with ADHD or other disorders placed under that classification to obtain services if they do not meet the stricter classifications under other categories.</P> <P>I would research very carefully what your state classifies as \"OHI\", and question why they will not place him under the educational autism classification if he obviously meets the criteria necessary for that classification. Check our your state\'s department of education website, particularly special education, and find out the exact criteria your state uses under the various categories.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- COPAA Advocate Member,MPact Mentor, single parent to 4 ages 19 to 6, all with disabilities.

'maybe i shouldnt of post a reply back , but i dont know how mucuh they spend, on edciaction for the spec ed i do know they dont spend enought b/c my child not getting what he deserve but what i agree with on her was that the school sytem in my town of ohio dont care about sped ed we got a brand new school and sped ed classes are a size of, i not good at measure so i say size of a school bath room that has 3 stalls so xthat by 2 and that all it very crowed for the HS and at the smaller gradees some are inclusion but for the ones that are not incusion they are so small they no run for the teacher files and thngs, also our basketball in door gymn is as big as the school, so what does that tell you they spendmore time on the sports and music then any other place, even the kitchen to feed the kids they are not big enough, so that what i was agree about oh yes the part of society yes i heard thigs like that they think these kids wont get no where i belive if the teacher and staff woul do there jobs yes our kids have a very good chance to make it, that why they dont care i work in the kitchen at school and i see and hear things, the sad point is they used the spec ed kids in the kitchen when they dont have no where else to put them, instead of getting them education they stricking them inot the kitchen and this is sad i understnd it gives them practice but these are 9-12 graders and i feellike education first then others, i could also see if these were seniors and they have all there credits then use them there. but alot of our spec kids dont understand when ther back there it we had a few get burn and hurt from the dishwaasher, i dont nlike that. b/c i afraid one going to hurt badly , but the school does this b.c of the spec needs dont have anyware to go and they want to save money instead of hiring cooks or more hours.also one of the older cooks that been there over 20 yrs said that , yes the teacher was involved with this, there was one spec need boy and he had alot of issues well the teachers had him bark like a dog and had him crawling on the floor and laugh at him!! this is very cruel thng that was done i ask if the parents ever found out and they said no, that what i hate about this school they cover everything up, i do have a child asperger and biploar child and i glad i right there to make sure this dont hapen but they dont provided him what he needs are they dont accept his diag and i try to fight it i could lose my job which at this point i off when he off and if i had to get another job i wouldnt have child care. but i can also say my oldest that ADHD he 24 now, i never knew this he told me at one of the old school he said if you were bad they would lock you in this dark room and leave you till they came back, and after i start working and found out where the room was which they made it out to be an littl counslor office after the other princapl left but you could tell my son was telling the truth and if i would of know about this i would of said something, he just said that the princapl wopuld makre them go n there the princapl retired thank god, but it just scary what can happen to our kids while they are at school, that why i like to moved away from this place and find a nice friendly and caring and the schools that want to help the spec needs kids. i hope i dont affend anyone'

'My child imitates alot. For him, peers who model appropriate behaviors is <br />better. I will give you an example.

My son stuck his tongue out the next day during <br />most of rug time, he stuck out is tongue at therapy and at home. First we <br />ignored it.( I thought is was for attention) and them we put it in <br />extinction. That is one small behavior but I rather he model appropriate <br />behaviors and get reinforced for doing so. As long as there are many <br />more peers who model appropriate behaviors, you are fine. I will add <br />that my son was in an asd playgroup run by our ABA agency and the kids <br />were pretty compliant and were pretty good just the social and <br />conversations were tough.

And even spelling the words right. </FONT></strong></P> <P><strong><FONT face=Arial color=#000033 size=2>My Mark even writes things that are profound like: \"Everyone is talking and no one is listening to me,\" which he wrote when he was about 10 years old. I\'ll try to dig out (of his baby book) some of the other profound things he has said. I remember once we were hiking when he was about seven, and he tripped over a log and fell down and started crying. And in the middle of the crying he said, \"Oh, did you hurt yourself?\" and then went on crying. It was funny and everybody laughed. </FONT></strong></P> <P><strong><FONT face=Arial color=#000033 size=2>I believe in waiting it out and encouraging their speech to come...and it will come, even if it is at first in grunts and slurrs. And it gets better as time goes on. That way they don\'t have to be dependent on something external to communicate. </FONT></strong></P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Best Regards, Marge</div>'

They have the last 3 years\' worth of ARI autism conferences available for free to watch.  Dr. Usman has presented at several, maybe all, and the latest ones she talks about the different \"kinds\" of autism she sees, and the specific traits that she treats as flags for specific kinds of poisoning.  Mercury is one kind of kid, arsenic another, perhaps lead another set of traits, etc.      I\'m off to vacation for a couple of weeks, but if you don\'t find it, I\'ll look and try to find a link.

' <div class=\"postbody\">That  happened to me more than once and I absolutely refuse to be apologetic about my son\'s condition, especially to a stranger whose opinion I could care less about.     My boy used to time his \"autism high jinks\" with the precision of a cat burglar and run from the check out line ALL the way to the very  back of the supermarket, around to the the other end, working his way back to the front, wailing and running quite fast, dodging and weaving with a very flustered, embarassed Mom weaving around carts herself. But the little stinker, being much smaller could  gain a considerable lead <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /> while all eyes were on us.      I half expected, half wished for the manager to announce over the PA system, \"Brat loose, aisle 3, near canned peas, brat on the run!!!\"     We had been standing on the check-out in, it was quite a spectacle and I wish the ground could have opened up and swallowed me whole.  No one said anything to me - probably the angry, embarassed, drained, sad expression on my face provoked sympathy, not resentment. No one stopped my boy either.  I guess that\'s NY for you.    Thank God he does not do that any longer.  I even took to holding his forearm in a death grip - boa constrictor style between my thighs when I did not have a free hand to hold him with! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" />     WE ASD MOMS ARE AWESOME AND RESOURCEFUL!

Please forgive or excuse me, my child has autism gives the rude person WWWAAAAYYYY too much power.  They do not have to be in the loop, my son\'s condition is on a strict need-to-know basis.    How about a simple,  \"While we are on the subject of self-control, we are working hard on his self-control issues, Why don\'t you  work on yours and spare me your unsolicited comments/advice?

'My ds likes to rip books up too. He also loves to read and point out pictures so in my case, the reading did not help his ripping much. Instead I had to divert with some sensory input toys for his hands...different textured balls, mini rubber octopus legs for him to pull on, teething blankets for him to twist and squeeze with his hands, ect. <br><br>It sounds like aside from the ripping, your ds is also attempting communication. :) Perhaps try the pec system (picture cards) where he can bring you a picture card and tell you what it is (they are usually laminated so he can\'t rip them). Puzzles help as well because they are already broken up so he can learn to put them back together, point out the pictures on them and he has something to work his hands with. <br><br>To address the taking from strangers issue, I would suggest you always have a small board book or a foam book on hand with you. They are small and what you can do is punch a hole in the corner of it and attach a spiral keychain to it which can go around his wrist or through his belt loop. That way if he gets distracted, you can easily remind him that he has his own book to look at and point out pictures from. Tip: I\'ve learned the more excited you get about something HE has in relevance to what others have helps him focus a lot more. <br><br>And last but not least, when my ds DOES rip something out of a book, I always go \"uh-oh! It\'s broken! We can\'t read it anymore. Now we have to put it in the garbage.\" My ds does not like messes or broken objects so it\'s helped lesson his ripping habits. Plus it\'s helped him understand that once it\'s ripped, it can\'t be fixed and that what he is doing it destructive. At first this upset him, but after awhile it sinks in. And I don\'t buy him new books unless he has gone a certain amount of time without ripping them up. <br><br>Hope this helps<br><br>~Natalie<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Single Mother to an 9yr old boy ~ PDD-NOS, Extensive Language Delay, Strong Behavioral Issues, Past history of seizures that have recently started up again    \"What a long strange trip it\'s been\"</div>'

'Look again on the IEP. It\'s VERY typical for kids who need a self-contained environment to be in a class that is capped at 12 with one teacher and one aide. Check it out, because THAT is how you get them to NOT combine classes.'
'<P>Okay as most of you know Bailey is doing this and it was a problem as school was drawing to a close. I had an aide assigned to Bailey-which the school didnt agree with, but we finally got one. I am worried abt his BIP plan though. </P> <P> As it is right now they are timing him -the min he runs away and he is having to make up the time in a secluded timeout room-mind you it could be a 15 min-to 40 min long that he has to make up-or longer if he runs agn..Ive even had to pick him up from school-as they didnt have enough time in the day to do the time outs etc... I just think this is rediculous-as he is taken away from assemblies, recesses etc and learning time-not providing a FAPE in MY opinion.Iknow the 10 day deal thing, but how exactly does this apply to timeouts EVERY DAY etc?....I just think they are dumping him somewhere at these times...I dont know.... They thought this plan was fine and asked me what I would suggest instead...I was thrown for a loop and ended up signing this rediculous BIP. So I need to schedule an IEP meeting to discuss this further, but I really dont know what to suggest to the school instead of this-any one have any ideas on how to manage this for a 7 yr old??????</P> <P> The problems tend to be at transition times and when he has activities with the reg classroom-such as computer, music, library etc? </P> <P>I guess my problem is -do you punish as with the time out-or what is appropriate for him to learn this is not how to handle frustrating situations etc. Do you let the child run, do you hold on to them, do you block them, try and catch them, then what to do when caught-Bailey tends to pinch and hit or kick when he is caught.He has made the aide bleed-through scratching etc-ive seen this as she came into an IEP meeting bleeding...I need some strategies that will work with him......I know his behaviors are NOT appropraite, but I dont know what kind of intervention IS appropraite-kwim? We dont have this problem at home anymore....so I dont know what to suggest to them. I feel terrible when he hurts people, but what is beyond his control???I dont know!!!!</P> <P> The district seams to think that if they just ignore it and then punish him this will solve all the problems etc-Im not too sure abt this one, but have nothing to suggest to them-kwim? They think it is on purpose as he laughs when he is running, but he has many INNAPROPRIATE facial expressions and attitudesthat he is not in control of-that dont make sense-He\'s NOT doing it for attention etc -like they think.</P> <P> Any suggestions???</P> <P> Love ya,</P> <P> Tammy</P>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi, I just registered now.  I hope someone here could better answer my questions because I\'m a bit upset about something...        First a bit of background.  I have a 2 and half year old daughter, Jada, and she\'s a bit behind on her speach.   She still says a lot of one words and she says 2,3 word phrases but I\'m not sure if she\'s learned them as one words so I tend not to count them as phrases.   We went throught the long process of getting her into speach therapy and she finally started that about 3 weeks ago.  30 minutes twice a week.  She also qualified for special instruction but we\'ve yet to find someone to give her the therapy around here. I figure she\'s just a bit behind the rest of the kids, even tho she is smart (imo) but that she\'ll eventually catch up.  my husband and I haven\'t been too worried about her.    So I\'m upset today of a convo I had with one of the ladies at her daycare.  Jada goes there 2 days per week.  She has been moved to the next class in daycare because she\'s 2 and a half now (so she\'s in the \"transitional three\'s\") and so her old \'teacher\' who i spoke to about her delays in the past is no longer her teacher but I saw her on the way to J\'s new class and she came out to talk to me. She wanted to know if Jada had been \"diagnosed\" and what we had done since last time about her speech. I told her she was in speech therapy now since about 3 weeks ago and that she\'s doing well and has learned to say a few new things but that she\'s still got a ways to go. She was happy to hear that but then she started with her stories of her cousin\'s kid and her sister\'s friends kid and how one has severe autism and the other is borderline and how the mom hadn\'t realized it till they were at the mall and some therapist bumped into them and said matter of factly \"oh, your son has autism\" blah blah blah.    to make a long story short, it\'s just her way of implying that she thinks Jada might be borderline autistic. I know it\'s typical mom\'s reaction but I\'m really upset by her implication of it.  I never for a second have thought that J could have a problem like that. Her reasons are she tippytoes a lot, and she flaps her arms around. Jada used to flap her arms around a lot but she doesnt\' do that anymore. She still tippy toes but my husband used to tippy toe till he was 6! so I dunno. That can\'t possibly be enough to make people think a kid it autistic is it? I mean J is extremely talkative (even tho not much of it is coherent lol!) and very interactive, friendly, outgoing, etc. She doesn\'t space out unless you\'re calling her and she decides she\'s too busy to hear you.      What do you guys think?    I mean, this lady is really pushing her to be \"diagnosed\" by her doctor. I don\'t see how her pediatritian can diagnose something like autism. Especially since she\'s NOT acting like she has that. not imo anyways!    I just looked up a list of early signs of autism online and they don\'t seem to fit her at all.   Could you guys tell me of a better way to see if she could have this? or some list of signs for 2.5 year olds?  The one i was looking at online seemed to be for 1.5 year old.  i\'m not sure.    I\'m really worried now and would rather know for sure that she doesn\'t have a problem like autism.     Or if she does, know that there are other signs other than tippy toing around ..</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">It\'s funny just as I was about to give up on this forum this afternoon has been one of the worst for a long time.  My oldest NA son has been having some very severe behavioral problems.  He has always been such a well behaved boy.  This all started shortly after I quit my job and decided to stay home and help Mitchell all I can.  We tried to talk to my oldest son I will call him (G).  We asked him if he is feeling like we are giving Mitchell alot more attention than we are giving him.  At first he said no and then he said that he was.  He said that he feels that no one loves him and he wants to go somewhere else.  He also said today that he wishes he were dead.  ( OH MY GOD!!!!!)  Why would he say that.  We have taken great strength in making sure that he doesn\'t feel left out.  My husband (his dad) is the soccer coach for his team and not to mention that we make sure that he gets to do fun things with his friends and family.  I just don\'t know what to do.  Today I told G that he had to stay in and finish his reading for school that he didn\'t finish over the weekend.  He started screaming at me I hate reading!!!!  I\'m not going to read!!!!  I told him that he has to finish his reading for school.  He was angry that he couldn\'t go outside.  So he started yelling and throwing things he even threatened to over turn furniture.  I know he is going to have to get counseling but I\'m not sure where the money for that is going to come from since my husbands insurance will not pay for any of Mitchells therapy.  I just need I don\'t know, some kind words or advice anything.  I have never felt so sad and frustrated at the same time.  Can\'t anything just ever go smoothly.  Does life always have to be so chaotic!!!!!!!   Sorry for the rambling I just don\'t know what else to do.  Thanks for listening.      Concerned Mom     Concerned Mom</div>'
'My two boys, one PDD, go to Montessori preschool. I am always surprised that Montessori is considered unstructured. I think it is more organized and structured than many preschools out there. I have yet to see a preschool that even comes close to the organization that my boys\' montessori school has. I think the misconception is that the kids with PDD will get stuck doing the same jobs. This is not true. The jobs are developmentally based so you will have kids at different levels which is great for all kids! Nobody should be boxed in to a curriculum that is targeted right at the middle...unless that is where they are at. My son isn\'t super rigid though so he does change jobs. Plus, the school is aware he has PDD so if it was an issue they would just have him try different things. I think my 4 year old is doing as well as he is doing because he is at montessori, and I think it is setting him up to be completely ready for K. Just my 2 cents.<br><br>eta: There are jobs that are for multiple kids so the teachers will gear ds toward these so he can get the extra social practice. They are also on the playground for 45 minutes. I have two other friends with kids on the spectrum that go to 2 separate montessori schools and they both feel strongly about the benefits of montessori for our kiddos.<br><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by kdchaos on August 28 2008 at 5:19pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>-</div>'

Anyway, a few months have now passed and for the past couple of weeks we keep finding that Luke is now creeping into the bottom bunk to sleep with Dom again, so we tried to convince Dom to go back up to the top...would you believe it, neither child wants to sleep on the top bunk now.....what\'s with these kids, top bunk is cool, top bunk is fun, there\'s a ladder and you can touch the ceiling, but no takers, both want the bottom bunk...  so fortunately for DH and I who are the play it safe variety of parent we bought bunk beds that come apart, so this afternoon we unscrewed the bunk beds and now they have 2 beds, both on the ground, and they were so excited, they played in their room all afternoon and could not wait to go to bed.....just had to share this story with you.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">OK, I\'m not an expert and have nothing to back me up except what I saw with my son and what I\'ve read on typical child development but I really think that you should be able to pick up at least red flags in a 6-month old. Thinking back, some of the things that were bothering me when my son was that young and I couldn\'t give a name to, were all probably related to his autism. I just don\'t think that there are enough people trained in developmental psychology to provide an early diagnosis for everybody. Most pediatricians and many evaluators (EI included) would go by a checklist that may yield a gray result and then (disaster !) advise watchful waiting. They may obsess over rolling over and crawling and not once ask for example if the child enjoys peek-a -boo or looks back at the parent in a situation of uncertainty.   I would say, if there is concern, definitely go for an evaluation, but make sure the person has tons of experience with ASD kids.

I could not just sit and wait for an opening at Bridges. <br />However, I looked and looked and found this wonderful woman who does <br />VB with him and it worked! <br />The dilemma I have is because I am such a pro-floortime. He responds <br />very well to both approaches, I just wished more hours in the day and <br />more energy to give him both. <br />I will post again about this after I have my feedback meeting with <br />Bridges, I don\'t even know if they will accept him after all. After today\'s <br />call I sensed a bit of hesitance because I told them right up front that he <br />is in VB/ABA. Which is very funny in a way because I sensed the same <br />thing when I had fist talked to his ABA teacher and told her that I would <br />like him to get to Floortime as well. <br />But of course this is a whole different topic.... <br />Thanks again! <br /> <br /> <br /><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Maria  mom to a 5.5-year old boy, E with classic autism</div>'

'<P>Matty, you posted while I was writing my novel-length post! If you only know that person somewhat - you don\'t know what she goes through at home. Kind of like some of our kids. My ds can seem really good at school or out in public, but at home - we have VERY different issues! So, I get a lot of people disbelieving or thinking \"he is just fine\". It is frustrating! I\'m just saying this because I don\'t think any of us can assume that what we see for brief snippets of time is always a reflection of what goes on in the daily life of the family. </P> <P>I, too, don\'t assume I know about what a parent goes through who has a completely non-verbal child with severe autism. But, I have sometimes tried to find a common bond and offer empathy and support. I think we can do that even if we don\'t walk in each other\'s shoes. Most people I have done that have been very receptive - perhaps it\'s my approach, as I have years of counseling experience and know how to gently say things (obviously not always though! <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley36.gif\" border=\"0\"> ). And I try to figure out if someone just doesn\'t want to hear it at the time. Most people aren\'t very good at that and perhaps you ran into someone like that.</P> <P>I agree that we need to listen and learn and help. I think we can do that with families of all kids with special needs. I don\'t want to be isolated into only talking with parents of kids with autism. They have different needs from us too! I do have several friends who have children with autism - and sometimes it is a total relief to be able to talk to them. We talk about things I can\'t talk about with others - like, Oh yeah - my son isn\'t dry at night yet either. He was for about 5 days straight once, but we\'re still working on it! And it\'s okay to talk to them about that. But, I need other friends too! And ones that I don\'t talk about autism with non-stop either. I need a break from it too - and it has taken me a while to figure that out!</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS (9 yo) diagnosed with mild PDD-NOS and DD (6 yo) NT - but definitely a challenge!</div>'

'The bottom line is that all evals that are necessary in order to determine whether or not your child will continue to need an IEP in K should be done BEFORE the meeting. Ask, in writing, that the results of all the evals that will be part of determining the IEP for next year be covered with you and explained BEFORE the meeting takes place. If that cannot happen, postpone the meeting. The IEP Meeting must take place at the convenience of the parents. Your son will be transitioning to a new school, so they may want to change some of the provisions of the IEP for K. For that to happen, the whole team (which includes you) must have and understand all the pertinent information about your son. If the new testing shows needs in certain areas or if it shows no progress since he started, then those are the areas where attention will need to be focused. If he\'s made enough progress so that he shows that he is functioning on grade level, I\'d fight getting him off an IEP until he\'s been functioning well IN kindergarten. If, by half-way through kindergarten he shows that he\'s been able to keep up with his peers, you can switch to a 504 Plan (a plan that shows that he has a disabiltiy but does not give him an IEP...this is important so that he continues to be covered by Civil Rights law).'
'<P>I totally understand where you\'re coming from. My son is 9 years old, and I just came home from Christmas breakfast in his mainstream class. It\'s so obvious he\'s an outsider who can\'t connect with the other kids. We all want to help, but teaching social skills to someone who\'s socially disabled is a HUGE challenge, even for those who are experienced with it. And no one at my son\'s school has any experience whatsoever.</P> <P>His academic skills are all over the place. Poor handwriting, you bet. Can hold a philosophical conversation with a grown-up but can\'t tell you if 72 is bigger than 39. The school is doing pretty good with him in academics, but during the Christmas month there is less academic emphasis and two of his three usual teachers are on leave for the month, and yesterday his other teacher was home with a sick child. </P> <P>Sometimes it seems like we autism parents face nothing but obstacles, but try and hold onto your dreams for your son. Remember that kids with autism often have that stairstep pattern of development, with long flat plateaus where seemingly no progress occurs, followed by steep learning curves. Hopefully you\'re in for some steep progress soon.</P> <P>Good luck with everything.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Norway Mom (mother of 2 sons who were born in 1998 and 2001.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello all! I am a mother of a child who is now being evaluated for Asperger\'s and I am also employed as a special education teacher in the middle school where we live.  I have two wonderful children. My son is 7 yrs old and he is currently being evaluated for Asperger\'s Syndrome. He has struggled for the last two years in school and I am so ready for answers and a plan to help him not struggle. We meet with the doctor\'s in May for a diagnosis. It has been so stressful on him because he can see he is different but doesn\'t understand why or how to fix it. In this process we have learned that he has a really really high verbal IQ and a above average IQ but there is a significant gap between the two. I live in a small community in Kansas where we don\'t have the resources as some places do. I also have a daughter who is 5 and seems to show no symptoms. I am a little stressed out and frustrated as I have no idea where to go or what to do that is best for my child. So I am so glad to find a community like this that allows me to talk with others going through the same process!  Can\'t wait to hear and talk with you all!  Nicole</div>'

'<P>Emma\'s mom, I sympathize with you. I\'ve had a similar experience in feeling unheard, unvalued, and powerless in my struggle for my own daughter\'s placement and supports. As a student pursuing my Bachelor\'s in Special Ed, I know that I have a pretty good understanding of IDEA and Special Education law. I also have a better-than-average understanding of my daughter\'s educational challenges and needs (partly because I\'m her mother, and partly because I\'ve done a lot of research on appropriate accommodation of children with comorbid diagnoses - autism &amp; bipolar, specifically). But I am in a unique situation because I have to stay on the good side of the schools; my future employability depends on it. I can\'t make too many waves. On the other hand, I really need to figure out how to get certain members of the IEP team to understand that my child (diagnosis PDD-nos, Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, &amp; Anxiety) is a whole child. She is not appropriately placed, and the team has refused for three years to consider the recommendation of two psychiatrists. They don\'t know what symptoms or warning signs to look for, and they refuse to listen to me even though I come prepared with documentation and outside resources. They don\'t acknowledge that her school experience affects her home experience, which promotes rapid cycling between mania and depression, which then puts her at an academic disadvantage because she is not receptive to learning when she is at emotional extremes. </P> <P>Anyway, the long &amp; the short of it is: I understand the frustration and the helplessness you\'re feeling, and I wanted you to know that you\'re not alone.</P>'

'<P>Take a breath and try to relax. I know it\'s hard.</P> <P>We went through a similar situation about three years ago, when our AS son was in 4th grade. </P> <P>Our As son is a huge World War II buff. At the time, he was getting very frustrated with his teacher, there was a bit of bullying going on and he was just hitting puberty, so hormones were all out of whack. He got mad at his teacher one day and declared that he was going to rid the world of the axis of evil (his teacher) by flying a bomber plane fly over her house or the school and dropping a bomb on her. Now, of course he wasn\'t going to be able to do it, but he said it. He said she was as evil as Hitler. During the same incident, he was waving a pair of little kids rounded end scissors around. In her mind, he was threatening to kill her, with the scissors and he was going to blow something up. The police were contacted, which of course means CPS was also contacted. In the end we were accused us of neglect and child abuse. CPS went to the school and talked with our younger daughter, who was in 2nd grade and we didn\'t find out about that until she got home from school that day. They also spoke with our son. Before I go any farther, let me say, our son is one of those kids that will just fall to the ground when upset, not just fall really, but he would throw himself to the ground, hard or he would throw himself into a wall when upset. This meant it wasn\'t uncommon for him to have a few bruises on his legs or his arms, or even his back. Of course, this meant we had abused him, instead. Also, my son had a slight bruise over his eye from where a girl my daughter had visiting threw something at him. When our son was interviewd by CPS he told them he and his dad fight all the time. They did, but it was play fighting and roughhousing. My daughter also told CPS this, but she stressed that it was playing, not real fighting. We had to go into CPS for an interview. An investigation was done and we were found completely innocent of all charges.</P> <P>My son was suspended from school for 6 weeks for terroristic threatening and when he returned to school, he was a nervous wreck. That same day he returned, the teacher told him to stop tapping his pencil on the desk. He refused and kept doing it. She made every one of those kids leave the classroom and had the police called in again, because she was \"terrified\" of what he would do! The police came to the school and actually threatend our son with arrest for not listening to the teacher. Boy was I livid when I found out later that day! (To this day, my son is terrified of the police because he thinks they are going to arrest him!) CPS was contacted again because the police were called in and we had to go through it all again.</P> <P>Earlier this school year it happened again, only this time I can understand why the police were called. My son went into major meltdown mode after getting in a fistfight with a boy at school. He has never been in a fight before. It turned out this boy had been bullying him terribly and my son never said anything because he didn\'t want to get the bot in trouble. It all came to a head in the boys bathroom when this boy kept calling our son all sorts of names and telling him to go ahead, hit me, just hit me and he kept pointing to his face while he was saying it, so my son hit him. This upset him and he just went off. He ran to his counselors office, I\'m assuming because it was a safe place, locked the door and was kicking filing cabinets, he was going to kill himself, he was going to kill \"that fat boy\" as he called the kid he had hit, etc. Once again I found myself at CPS and once again we are not abusive parents that beat and neglect our children. Thank You Mr. CPS man! </P> <P>When you have an interview with CPS, be prepared to educate them on AS. Take in info sheets printed off of the net if you have to. Explain to them that what your son says, is not necessarily what he means. When I had our first CPS meeting, the first thing I did was explain to the caseworker, that with our son, he is VERY literal. If you want the \"real\" answer you have got to ask the right questions. If he had asked my son does your dad punch you, my son would have said yes. Luckily it went like this....</P> <P>Do you and your dad play together? Yes. </P> <P>Do you ever play any games where someone gets hit? Yes. We beat each other up!</P> <P>What kind of games do you play where you beat each other up? Things like boxing and wrestling.</P> <P>Does anyone get hurt when you play these games? Yes. I beat my dad up all of the time, just like Lenox Lewis.</P> <P>When you play is your dad happy or mad? He acts like he\'s mad ( at this point my son made a scrunched up, mean face) but he\'s just being like an actor because he\'s not really mad because he\'s laughing the whole time and you can\'t be really mad (that face again) when you are laughing.</P> <P>I have kept the notices I have received clearing us of all charges for that \"Just in case\" moment I fear might come. Like I said though, be prepared to educate them on AS and how it affects your child.

Doctors can contradict each other. There are some good ones out there, including the one who started this board, but they don\'t live with your child or even spend much time with them. Many of them are good people with good intentions, but they are people and they do make mistakes. There are also some doctors that just want to fleece you. There are also the people who make recommendations just to push their products at you. I would not take any person\'s word for anything, not without checking the facts and research, unless they are a parent(especially on this board) reporting how something worked. For example, if a bunch of parents are saying something helped, why would that intervention be excluded, just because a DAN doc thinks it\'s a waste of time?  You have to be the QB. At the end of the day, you should make the decision. <strong>Have confidence, that when you do your homework and have all of the information, you can decide what is best for your child better than anyone else.</strong> You don\'t have to spend a huge amount of money either in order to help your child.  I wouldn\'t go as far as to say DAN isn\'t for us. Some of it worked, but a lot of it didn\'t. We are taking an approach of &quot;do what has worked for others first&quot;. We do some DAN, some Yasko, some Cutler and most importantly operating off positive feedback from parents, especially on this board. Thank God for this board.  One tip I will give you is that after DAN appeared to be a failure for us, we did a nutrogenomic test and some of the recommendations have worked. Some of the DAN interventions can work, but sometimes are implemented improperly for your child.  I\'ve been where you\'re at, frustrated and overwhelmed, and I\'ll likely return there soon. I can only tell you that once I made the decision that I was going to take the lead in making decisions for my child\'s interventions, I have been at peace. After wasting a lot of valuable time and money, discovering and proving mistakes by the doctor, I finally made that decision and I now have peace about it. We have doctors, who are fine people, and they are part of the team, but I am the QB. My wife and I make the final call. Period. No one else is trusted to make the final decision for my child. As parents, we can read. The information is out there. We can arm ourselves. The improvements are now slowly coming, even from interventions the DAN doc said were a waste of time or couldn\'t be used. Don\'t get me wrong the doctors are still a valuable resource and a contributor to what\'s going on, and feel they are &quot;in charge&quot;, but we as the parents have the ownership.  There are some low weeks and some high weeks. Keep &quot;turning over rocks&quot; and you will get some improvement and you\'ll be on the upswing soon.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Parent of  7 YO PDD-NOS 5 YO NT</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Parent of  7 YO PDD-NOS 5 YO NT</div>'

So I used a chart with who, what, and where.  I had each of the choices on an index card so he could build the sentence he wanted and then write it.

Needless to say, they certainly are not looking forward to seeing us again. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />   They had the supervisor of special ed attend the meeting, which I understand is not common at this school. I think that she was there because I had sent a list of request a month in advance and they could tell that we were not going to be one of those parents that does not have a clue.  All in all they were very nice (except the supervisor).  The biggest bone of contention was the related services----naturally.  We were requesting 30 minutes per day of speech therapy. At first it appeared that they agreed, until I stated one-on-one time.  At that point we had a one hour argument, where the supervisor made statements such as \"we are looking at what is best for Tanner\" \"we are moving away from exclusion services and towards inclusion\" and my all time favorite \"perhaps you all can contact the director of special ed and request additional space for one-on-one therapy\"  Our reply\'s were very firm and very swift. I did tell her in no uncertain terms that she should not try to tell me what is best for Tanner as she has never even met the kid. My husband told her the same thing along with one comment of \"how do you think that you know what\'s better for Tanner, you haven\'t even read the file.\" (obvious from the way that she did not have a clue as to what it contained). He also told her that we were not there to discuss the schools internal issues (in response to the \"additional space\" comment) but are here to discuss what is best for Tanner and what he needs to meet his goals. He thing said, \"now we are telling you that Tanner must have one-on-one speech therapy in order to reach the goals that we are setting, are you telling me that if we want individual therapy then we should contact your director?\" Of course she said no. There was a lot of other things said but mostly just a repeat of the \"let\'s do what\'s best for Tanner\" c--- (which really meant let\'s do what\'s best for our bottom line) followed by our \"we are not budging\" comments.  In the end, we walked out of there with not one compromise in what we were after. So I guess I should say that it went well.

That is only one in 250,000 children and that is not very many. Now the statistics tell us that one in 166 children are on the autism spectrum disorders; some communities in California are at one in 100 and Brick Township in New Jersey is at one in 10. Those are vastly different numbers, staggering in their immense disproportion. You math wizards can figure out the percentage of the increase. I just know it is high - very high. Too high to make sense.  It doesnâ€™t make sense because the human genome has not changed much in the past how-ever many tens of thousands of years. Humans now are basically what humans were. (As a side note, in my research I found that only cats have had that little of a change in their genetic makeup - cats and humans have not changed a lot - another interesting tidbit.) So we canâ€™t say it is genetic unless there has been some unseen and undocumented shift in the human genome within the past 20 years. Iâ€™m sure had that happened, we would know about it.  The introduction from the environment (meaning introduction into the child from the outside) of a substance that could cause this, does have a certain logic. Especially when coupled with a genetic code that could have been there all along but needed the right â€œtriggerâ€ to cause it to fail. The gene could have been there since Day One of Human One, but it needed the right kick to break it; mercury and thimerosal would definitely be something that would make sense. After all, can this many parents be wrong? Obviously, something is going on.  But, having said of all that, we still must return to square one. What about the 4 in 10,000 in the past and what about the low functioning autistic children today? These children are in a huge minority and they arenâ€™t being looked at as closely as the high functioning children. Probably that is for a couple of reasons; one being that these kids are not going to respond as their higher functioning companions will and frankly, no one knows how to reach these distant and silent children who have no need to reach back. I do not know the statistics on low functioning autism. I donâ€™t know if there even are any. I canâ€™t find any but I would be willing to put a yearâ€™s wages on those numbers being about the same as autism diagnoses in the past, adjusting for population growth and other variables.  If I am right, then the increase of diagnoses of autism spectrum disorders is on the rise because it was collected into a previously existing diagnosis. It was the closest, it made some sense to do it that way, but are we really truly looking at the same disorder?  In my opinion, no, we are not looking at the same disorder. There are two things going on here. There is autism and then there is autism. And the two have very little in common.  I realize I am not the first to come to this conclusion. There have been other commentaries about this very issue. I have heard it referred to as â€œvaccine induced autism,â€ and â€œclassical autism,â€ which is what I talking about, but I think the terms still fall short.  Building on my assumption, where does this leave the autism community? How can this information be researched and developed into treatments? Can the diagnosis be separated? Can the research community, and even more specifically and critically, the government, be expected to be honest enough to fund research into this problem and help both sets of kids? Can the community of people concerned with autism unite and stop accusing whoever they are accusing that day, while trying to litigate for damages, or at least have the right to litigate, and put that money toward honest research that places no financial blame but solves the unending question of, â€œHow has this happened?â€  That is asking a lot. Each individual family would have to ask themselves how they really felt about that. Without some serious dismantling and restructuring of the diagnostic criteria, it isn\'t going to happen. The real problem is who is paying for this - I don\'t mean financially. I mean, who is suffering? The kids. The kids with both kinds of autism who have, due to our inability to solve this problem, a lack of cause, treatment, and a future that is dubious at best.  Created on December 17, 2005</div></div>'

'In the absence of expertise in autism, you can ask that a consultant teacher be provided to help with recommendations throughout the year. The Consultant comes into the classroom periodically (as agreed to on the IEP) and observes and answers the teacher\'s questions and can do FBAs and develop BIPs, etc. Consultant teachers are provided for in state regulations when necessary for a child with any sort of disability. However, in New York they are required for kids with autism who are not in classrooms specifically for the autistic. And DEFINITELY, one workshop does not constitute \"preservice training.\" Since it\'s highly unlikely that this teacher CAN get enough training prior to having your child in class, insist on a Consultant, at least for the first half of the year.'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I have not don\'t the antiviral yet. My DAN is big on chelation as the main cause, so we are still waiting to do that. But, I do think ours is viral for sure. Yeast will get bad from what I hear, maybe have a couple of things you can rotate in or use together when it gets bad. It seems both chealtion and antiviral therapy make the yeast worse. I and many others feel that yeast is the bodies way of protecting itself, so it\'s kind of the last thing to show up and the most evident with the most symptoms. The underlying issue is the main cause of the yeast. Metals and viruses that are living in the body are depressing the immune system or evading it somehow. I do wonder if our generation is possibly getting the rubella virus while pregnant because our shot has worn off, since we\'re the first generation to get the shot instead of natural immunity. I wonder what our NT kids are going to have to do in 20 years with all of their shots and 2nd generation immunity? Antibiotic use certainly hasn\'t helped either. Bacteria is another idea like Lyme. there\'s a mom who recovered 5 kids on another forum by treating lyme. It can get into the lymph system and cause all the immune abnomralities we\'re seeing with not just our kids, but our parents too. My father in law had it, and I think my mom does too with her debilitiating arthritis. There are some that are saying that a tick bite isn\'t the only way to pass it on. It can go from mom to unborn child, from dad to mom through sexual contact. They\'re even saying contact with an infected dogs urine can pass it on along with mosquitoes and fleas. I hope not, cause how do you stop all that from happening? stay inside all the time and have no pets? brain is tired.

A lot of autism is also early diagnosed as mild cerebral palsy since the symptoms are similar. Did you have spastic muscle tone, or dropped foot and low muscle tone? dragging of one side? did the brain scan show damage that would indicate true CP? We had this diagnosis too. Lead poisoning can also present like this. Too much ammonia in the muscle tissue can cause bodywide hypoxia and this is from mold too possibly. Go to lowes and get one of those cheap kits.

If I don\'t know what the problem is- just that there is one, I feel powerless about being able to take action, and that makes me miserable.</P> <P>I don\'t have enough information from you post to advise you on what to do next. Why did the psychologist put him in the PDD-NOS category. Was there any testing done? Was this simply a suspicion? How old is your child now? If he has an IEP, he needed to have an evaluation first. What testing was done for the evaluation?</P> <P>You can always request a new evaluation anytime, and request testing for ASD. However, if your child already has PDD-NOS, all of the teaching and interventions that can be used are the same, so it depends how much energy you want to sink into it. Maybe for your own information, read the DSM-IV criteria for Autism, Asperger\'s, and PDD-NOS.</P>'

'<P>My son C went to regular ed kindy with a 1:1 aide. One of the best things we did when making that decision is try it.</P> <P>The pre-K SpEd program that C was in was in the same school building as regular ed kindergarten. C was able to join the kindergarten class as a \"special guest\" for a few days in late April. I think they did it with him 3 separate times, for 60 - 90 minutes each time. An aide from his SpEd preschool was with him. He participated in circle time, art projects etc. Clearly no one expected him to do the level of work expected of a kindergartener near the end of kindergarten, but his aide helped him and it was a good experience for everyone. It gave the team a clear idea of how he would react when in a class full for 17 regular ed kids. </P> <P>To back up, we had an IEP meeting in early April that year and set the goals, but everyone (me, dh, the entire team) was on the fence about placement for kindy. So we decided to do this try it out approach over the next 2 weeks and then reconvene in early May for the placement. After C did so well in during his \"visits\' to kindergarten, eveyone felt comfortable with the placement of regular ed kindy with a 1:1 aide.</P> <P>I will tell you though that while we thought he was ready for reged kindy, what we found was that he was pulled out alot. He had pullouts for speech, ot and social work. Plus when he would get frustrated he would get disregulated and then he would have to \"take a break\" which involved going to the resource room. He was out of the class more than he was in it and he missed alot. For first grade we changed our minds and put him in a SpEd classroom (1:1:8 ratio) with mainstreaming for art, music, gym, library, computers, lunch &amp; recess. This has been a great environment for him and we\'re really happy with it. Prior to making that decision, we did formal observations (90 minutes each) of C in reged kindy, a reged 1st grade, and 2 different self-contained options.</P> <P>IMHO, there is no magic test that can tell how your child will do in reged. For me, it\'s really the seeing is believing. You should observe all of the possible placements (current + both reged and sped at next level) and IMHO you\'ll just know where your child fits best - at least I did.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Kristy  Mom to 10 year old twin boys (1 PDD-NOS, 1 ADHD)</div>'

I did want to ask if you child came up positive for other viral markers.  My daughter had some of the tests ran, but did not come up positive for viruses.  I was curious if that would be an indicator that she more then likely didn\'t have this retro virus or if it doesn\'t matter about other viral markers.

'<P>If he likes music, I can make a couple more suggestions. Kindermusic and gymboree likely run summer programs in your area, but are on the pricey side. What about the symphony? Our symphony runs summer kids programs (just a few here and there, but still fun - I would think Philly\'s would be much larger). If he is in a music class now, can you make a music playgroup for the summer with the other Moms in the class (this is the time that everyone struggles with \"what am I going to do this summer\")? You could rotate between people\'s houses and have fun with instruments (they don\'t even have to be real instruments - pot and pans, homemade instruments etc...). Also, if you have a group, Gymboree usually runs their gymbomusic program for less - here its $7 per child each week. </P> <P>Horseback riding is expensive. We are supposed to start in the next couple weeks at a theraputic horseback riding program - they are $35 per hour. I was kind of surprised as it was less than I thought (although it will add up with time). If you just tried regular horseback riding lessons, you might try a theraputic place to see if it is less. I think in PA we can qualify for some financial help for summer programs too. You might ask your case manager (we never followed up).</P>'

So he definitly is not typical or is showing great difference from the \"normal\" kid. Each doc says PDD NOS but our Psychologist is working on the testing to see what degree he is on the spectrum more in depth.</P> <P>He cannot play with friends because he does not know how to interact but to hurt them. He screams and tantrums basically about anything. He is beginning to show a photographic memory. Tantrums at change of routine or transition. He does speak excellent and has lots of bigger words so that is the tripper. He has GI issues. Repetative Behavior, spins, rocks, hand flaps in extreme excitement or anxiety. He is a runner and will escape the house or us in public and has no fear of streets cars, danger like hot stove etc. He is going to be 4 in November and these skills should be showing by now I would think. Anyways, gotta run to the Child Psychologist got testing in about a half hour. </P> <P>Hope this clears it up for ya.</P> <P>Suns<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"></P><div class=\'post_sig\'>-      Jaxon 4 has Autism but it is not stopping him!

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi all,    Just wondering how our \"home program\" (Early Intervention plus my work w/ DS) compares to some of the more formal programs others are using/employing, so that I can get a feel for what might lie ahead for us and how different it will (or will not) be.     At present, our \"ABA\" program (approx. 5 hours per week, but about to go up) isn\'t yet looking very structured (though I expect this to change within the next two weeks after some recent conversations and \"encouragement\" on my part).  In short, we (I) have a short list of goals (7 total for a three-month period), and I\'ve created a list of things we can do to support each of them.  This list is now hanging on a mirror in our foyer to keep me - and our therapists - focused.      For instance, one of my goals for DS is \"blowing,\" and next to the goal I have listed several activities/exercises we can and should do regularly to support the goal. These activities include blowing bubbles, whistles, straws (blowing into cup of liquid or blowing diluted paint on a piece of paper), blowing cotton balls/pom-poms/tissues/feathers across a flat surface like table or floor, etc.       Another goal is using utensils to self-feed.  In order to meet this goal (in addition to HOH and repetition), DS needs improved hand strength, so next to goal is a list of things we can and should do daily to improve his hand strength:  Pop beads, slot toys, legos, painting, hand walking, therapy putty, squeeze balls, clothes pins, etc.     Ok, so you get the picture -- a list of goals, with corresponding lists of \"things to do\" to reinforce them.  So basically, the therapists pull out their bag of tricks and toys with these goals in mind, and when they aren\'t here, I try to run through as many of the items on my list as I can.  All of this looks like play to DS.  The toys, activities, etc. are all fun.    While doing these things, we try to encourage him to sit at his table, but if he gets antsy, we\'ll allow him to stand at the table to complete the task before moving on.  If he needs a break or has had \"enough\", we allow him to wander off for a moment and try to participate in whatever he\'s gotten into (books, for instance), with his goals in mind.  So, if he\'s had enough table play/hand-strengthening, after he\'s helped to clean up, if he goes over to his book shelf, we\'ll join in and use it as an opportunity to prompt for words and encourage pointing (another goal), etc.     How does this differ from what you\'re doing/seeing in a more formal ABA program??    ETA: I have to add a \"cute thing\" here... our little trampoline arrived this afternoon (jumping is another one of our goals) and Little Man is jumping on it with Daddy Bear at this very moment!!!! I\'m beginning to think the kid is reading his list of goals - he\'s been on fire this week.  OK, sorry.... <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarassed\" />  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" />  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /></div>'

Per definition, these children will have a severe impairment in speech, communication, or social interaction.

Mostly, however, these children have social interaction difficulties and impairments related to a restricted, repetitive, stereotype behavior. These kids may have very high IQ\'s, may do very well academically, have a superior memory for \"unimportant\" details, such as the birth dates of all baseball players, some historical or geographical trivia, yet they lack the skills to care for themselves and live independently. These individuals may talk repetitively about a certain topic without understanding that it may be boring to others. The \"amount\" of memory of these individuals is incredible and one may expect different degrees of impairments with Asperger\'s syndrome. This may involve more or less memory and more or less social communicative impairment with regards to being able to live independently. As long as a child or individual seems \"different\" or \"odd\" and has a thought process that doesn\'t fit the way everyone else thinks, yet shows some of the required autistic characteristics, Asperger\'s syndrome should be considered. Many people with this condition remain undiagnosed because of their ability to compensate with their memory or excellent academic abilities, yet they are considered by others to be \"socially inept,\" \"weird,\" \"nerds,\" \"bizarre,\" \"eccentric,\" etc. </FONT> <P><FONT color=#000000>A typical example of a child with Asperger\'s syndrome would be that of a child who has some odd behaviors, poor eye contact, \"sluggish\" social interaction abilities, and an extreme interest in a central topic such as a washing machine. The child likes to sit and watch the washing machine door rotate, knows everything about it including its operative and professional manual and may spend hours perseverating about it. Such a child when he has a play date, may try to involve his \"friend\" in his most exciting interest (the washing machine) without realizing how boring it is to others and that will be the end of the play dates forever. This pattern may present itself in different degrees and circumstances, but the prinicipal is the same: the lack of the ability to understand how other people perceive what you do, say, or express with body language and facial expressions.</FONT><U> </U> <P><A name=C>C.<B> Childhood disintegrative disorder</B></A><U> </U> <P><FONT color=#000000>These are kids who develop normally for the first 3 years of life. Later they seem to regress and develop some autistic features associated with a severe functional impairment. These children must be thoroughly evaluated for the possibility of the development of seizures, affecting the speech areas of the brain, or Landau Kleffner syndrome (acquired epileptiform aphrasia), where seizure activity \"robs\" the brain from previously acquired speech. </FONT> <P><A name=D>D.<B> Rett\'s disease</B></A><U> </U> <P><FONT color=#000000>This affects only girls. These are girls who develop normally until 6 months of age and regress. Their regression is associated with microcephaly (small head). The head size seems to stop growing from 6 months and on, from the time of the observed regression.

'y twins dx with pdd-nos (mild ) at age 19mths & with EI <br />has made huge progress, after age 3 only twin#2 e <br />qualified for speech services in an integrated classroom <br />(head start program) while the other twin #1 inspite of <br />me requesting many times did not qualify for IEP. <br /> <br />They also attended many preschools apart from head start <br />program & have had no issues. <br /> <br />They will be in elementary this September. <br />With twin #2 the spec ed teacher gave me 2 options <br />,either to mainstream him with resource(speech) or attend <br />a mild special day class. Now i just cannot decide which <br />would be good option for him, special day class is 15 <br />students with aides & sp teachers while regular class has <br />28 students & one teacher. I am afraid that he might get <br />lost in the crowd for not getting the proper attention he <br />needs but then again i feel i should not hold him back <br />from his potential he might have. <br /> <br />Should i take gradual steps or put him into a class of 30 <br />kids. <br /> <br />twin#1 he has no issues ,does very well in preschool has <br />friends but then i have a feeling that he needs to stand <br />up for himself when he dislikes something in school be it <br />the environment or friends (he\'s very sensitive outside <br />world but at home he\'s the monster). i try to teach all <br />my kids to stand up for themselves but then wish he could <br />attend a social skills class <br />with him i am scared of him getting into bullying. <br /> <br />we r trying for ABA thru our Ins but not sure it.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Just wanted to chime in to say that unlike ABA where therapists usually work with the child, RDI is very much parent lead. They do \"allow\" for \"extenders\" to be used, but one of the main purposes of RDI is to establish a \"master-apprentice\" relationship and grow from there. so it is only natural that this relationship start with the parent.   It is difficult, and G while a very entertaining speaker doesn\'t exactly get \"to the point \" fast (sometimes I get the feeling from watching him that he really likes to hear himself talk <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /> ), but the DVD is good (better than the tape). Their website also has a lot of video clips showing RDI in action, these are probably the most useful IMO.   I agree, it is a nice adjunct to ABA, though I find it 10 times harder.

'All schools HAVE to do their own evals before a child is accepted into a program and, thereafter, every three years at least. Some schools insist on doing their own evals before they pay for you to take your child for a second opinion to a person of your choice (Independent Educational Evaluation) but some schools will let you skip their eval under certain circumstances and go straight for the IEE. If you get an eval done by your own doctor or therapist on your own dime, the IEP (IFSP) team MUST take it into consideration, but they can reject it after considering it. If, in the end, you don\'t agree with their take on it, you can ask for Mediation or an Impartial Hearing. These are very serious steps, so good negotiating should come way before that.'
'sense of humor? <br /> <br />i used to work at disneylandia and sometimes lots of autism kids would <br />show up at the same time. sometimes some kid would do something <br />rediculous, and the parents/chaperones would get all pissed off at me, but <br />sometimes they (the parents) would just laugh. i liked it a lot more when i <br />could just laugh along instead of feeling bad.'
'juls35inva, After reading your response I think you might want to express your feelings about his softball playing to him. You both are responsible for this child and just because he brings home the money does not mean that is his only responsibility. Maybe you could get a babysitter and go to his games and then the two of you, or a group of you go out afterwards. I think you need some adult time too. Or some time for you to relax and enjoy each other. We all have to make sacrifices for our children it sounds like you might be the only one doing this. A Happy Mother Makes A Happy Home.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thanks again everyone for all of your help.  I knew I\'d get some sound advice from <strong>awesome</strong> moms!!!  His teacher and counselor are open to learning more about RDI.  We are just embarking on this path (we have our first meeting with our local consultant next week) so hopefully it will help him improve in these areas.    irene - I attended a 2-day parent workshop on RDI and Dr. Gutstein said the same thing as you are saying.  He said that one of the biggest mistakes parents make is assuming that by placing their ASD child with NT kids that they will somehow become \"more social\" simply through exposure.  He compared this to placing a child with a disease like cancer (God forbid!) in a playground and expecting them to be cured just by being around healthy kids.  If our children were able to learn language and play incidentally, wouldn\'t they have picked it up by being around their first playmates, us? Lord knows all we do is try to pull language and interaction from them.    Nicholas struggles to imitate me, he certainly isn\'t going to voluntarily imitate his peers.  I joke with my husband that basically a child in his class could whip out a piece of cardboard and start breakdancing and Nicky probably wouldn\'t even take notice! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />   He surely needs more support than just pure immersion.    Also, he does recieve speech at school with another child.  His speech therapist says he does play nicely with this little girl.  However, I am sure it is heavily directed and it is also a pull-out program.  Therefore, he is brought to a small speech room where there is little distraction.  He can\'t seem to generalize the skills when brought back to his class.  Perhaps, if she feels he is ready, she can do a push-in to see how he handles it with competing stimulation.    respect - I AM angry too!  I feel that he is being treated the way he is simply because he has a diagnosis.  I still believe there is such a stigma attached to the \"A\" word and that his teacher is honestly freaked out and wants to wash her hands of it.  He will certainly finish out the year where he is, but part of me wants to have him moved because I feel like he\'s not wanted there.  I\'m meeting with Dr. McCarton (developmental ped.) next week and am really banking a lot on her input.  In addition to her medical practice, she also runs a private school in Manhattan for ASD children.  Because she has so much experience on the medical front as well as the educational front, I\'m hoping she can give me some direction.  I would be willing to bring him anywhere (even if it means I have to move) but the only problem is that I also have a 9 month old so it makes things a little more complicated.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\"><strong>Warning:  Long.  I\'ve dealt with a lot of hardship, a lot of suffering, and I think I may be Autistic.  I would rather be too detailed than too brief.  Besides, It also feels good to write, and it\'s something I don\'t do often enough - it\'s hard to get that much quiet time.</strong>    This may seem an odd question - to some extent, it\'s a reflection of the individual asking it.  This post is a little on the long side, but I do not really know how to be any more succinct.  To some extent, I\'m venting - hoping that there is an answer for me, somewhere.  A lot of this I\'ve never mentioned to anyone - it\'s easier to write than to discuss in person.    Looking over my list, I think I may be Autistic - I don\'t know, though.  My memories aren\'t always the best.  I keep facts straight, but beyond that - I have no clue.    I have been going through a period of self-discovery after a bit of severe depression, as well as a lot of introspection.  In short, trying to understand myself.  Talking with friends, it was suggested that perhaps some of my traits would be consistent with an Autism Spectrum Disorder.  I have also been told that I am too functional, too intelligent for that to be a possibility.    While doing a bit of research, I came across <a href=\"http://thiswayoflife.org/whatisitlike.html\" class=\"postlink\">thiswayoflife.org</a>.  In it, Joel (an aspie) describes a number of things that he has found set him apart from the general population.    Reading through the site, I feel like I wrote it.  With the exception of a few minor things (sensory crossover), these are all differences I\'ve noticed between myself and others over the years.    I am rather obsessive about things, but only certain ones.  I have had a lifelong fascination with locks and security.  I taught myself to pick simple locks, and exploit combination locks at around age 5.  It doesn\'t matter the system - magnetic, electronic, mechanical, or the location - I know what it is, and I probably know how to break it.    I also am an expert in forgery - I know about inks, magnetic properties, UV reactive (shortwave/longwave), moire/interference patterns, etc.  I can fake almost anything.    Despite all the time, all the energy, all the money and effort I\'ve put into these pursuits, I have no use for them.  I\'ve never used a forged document, and I\'ve occasionally picked locks when appropriate - I just never could bring myself to stop.  I see a door, I assess it\'s vulnerabilities - I see a window, I look for a sensor.  I walk into a room, I notice the positioning of the infrared sensors, cameras, etc.  I will often fail to miss the furniture, but I know what\'s there security wise.    I finally just gave in - started doing security consulting.  I\'ve always been this way, I literally just can\'t turn it off.  So, I might as well make some money.      I have a very, very, very hard time understanding what people are feeling - for some time, I\'ve had to tell people \"if I\'m hurting or offending you, let me know\".  I really have no clue most of the time.  There are some facial expressions I can recognize intellectually, and vocal pitch changes, but I have to really work at it.  I\'ve told my family repeatedly to let me know - for the longest time, it seemed that every time I would talk to them, I would offend them.  When I ignored them, not wanting to hurt them, they complained that I was hurting them by not talking to them.  I tend to add a lot of disclaimers to things I write, or say - often times, I\'m told they were unnecessary.    Some emotions simply don\'t exist for me.  As Joel describes, I do not, and have never felt grief.  A dog of ours, who I considered myself close to - he died in the most gruesome way I can imagine.  I know this, I recognize this, but my thought at the time as he died on our front lawn was \"I had better figure out how to fake sadness, or my family will think I\'m really callous\".  I\'ve had family members die, and I wanted to feel *something*, but it just wasn\'t there.    I also do not feel remorse, I rarely feel pain - I had my wisdom teeth removed, and took one pain pill because they told me to.  After that, I never bothered - there was literally no pain, and I was up and about in 20 minutes, riding my bike 7 miles to the theater in a few hours  , and back at work the next morning.  I\'ve rammed glass up my knee and not noticed it - I periodically get injuries, and know about them only because of the blood.    I experienced Joy for the first time in January after starting some hormonal treatments - that endorphin rush that comes along with excercise, with doing somethiing right, with meeting someone new.  Before that, the only emotions in my life were negative, or temporary buzzes - I did anything I could to get that high, that buzz.  I was heavily, heavily addicted to pornography (hours a day) and thrill seeking, and a bit of a masochist.  I ended up with a felony explosives conviction for my troubles.  When I finally was able to feel right, to feel well, I no longer felt suicidal or compelled to engage self-destructive behavior.    I cannot deal with extremes of sensation, of noise, of scent.  While I call them \"allergies\" to make it easier for others to understand, I have been tested - they aren\'t.  It\'s more technically an irritant.  Any strong scent, really, makes me feel awful, headaches - I have to get out of there.    I run around in buildings with sunglasses on - I find it\'s more comfortable for me.  I have never been able to handle crowds - I\'m always backstage, outside - anywhere but there.    I can\'t deal with distractions - I can\'t work if there is any intermittent sound going on, even a low level hum, or a radio.  I can\'t sleep if anyone has music loud enough for me to detect their presence.  Trying to have a conversation in a room with a TV on is impossible - to add insult to injury, I can hear the hum that monitors and TVs make.    Talking to people is often a frustrating experience - I have sensitive hearing, and will plug my ears in movies, but I have a very, very difficult time differentiating between background noise and speech.  I will compensate - using a combination of interpolation (what words made sense) and lip-reading.  I don\'t look people in the eyes - it frustrates me greatly.  I use subtitles/closed captioning when I can - I love them, much to the annoyance of most of my family.    If I had a dollar for every time I was told \"look at me when I\'m talking to you\", or I\'ve had to tell people \"I\'m sorry - I can\'t see you, so I don\'t know what you are saying\" - well, I\'d have ea lot of dollars.   When I was in class, I would put my head down on the desk and close my eyes so I could pay attention.  After answering teachers questions without fail, they learned to ignore it rather than accusing me of sleeping.    I can look people in the eyes, and being in sales - I learned to fake compassion, empathy, happiness - necessary to sell, but it was rote repetition - an act, practiced and repeated.  I tended to stick to trade shows, where I will do the same sell to 500-600 booths.    I have no problem with repetition - it\'s comfortable, it\'s easy.  When I get a new song, I will set it on repeat - listen to it over and over and over again - sometimes more than a week.  Eventually, I tire of it, and find another song.      I do not deal well with change - I\'ve fought it passionately, even when it made no sense to do so.  When I was in middle school, I was missing the bus because my showers took too long.  My father attempted to get me to move showers to the evening - in retrospect, it was a rational approach. I declared an emotional war of sorts - having an emotional breakdown the likes of which he had never seen - sobbing, doubled over, shaking uncontrollably.  The shower issue was quickly forgotten.  The problem is that it was cold, it was rational - I made a decision to do that, and as soon as I got what I wanted, it was over.    I have never been able to handle distractions - I work in the office, and people pop in to ask a question, to say hi, whatever.  I end up snapping at them, often badly - that is not a conscious decision.  It can ruin my days for hours, making it impossible to work.  To them, they took 30 seconds of my time, a reasonable thing to do.  To me, it\'s emotional murder.    I\'ve had to work on coping - not calling people at 4AM, not taking people literally - working hard to have consideration for other\'s feelings.  I am a very, very, very blunt individual - it\'s hard to take into consideration how others will feel about something, when you don\'t feel the emotions they have.    I think I\'m finally starting to feel the emotion called \"Love\".  It\'s new to me - I had never felt it, nor the compulsion to be with anyone.  I was fine on my own - it was other people that seemed to have a problem with it.  I\'ve never been on a date - I\'d simply never had any desire, nor any clue how one goes about having a relationship.  I would hug people, because it seemed to benefit them - it had no meaning for me.  I\'ve started feeling something - I hugged - truly hugged - my mother for the first time yesterday.  It was nice.    Remembering people\'s names might help - I can remember their phone number, their brand of clothing, the model of their calculator, but not their name.  \"Hey you\" doesn\'t seem conducive to establishing productive, meaningful relationships.    I don\'t get gender.  It\'s not that I can\'t look at someone and go man/woman - it\'s just that I\'m often wrong, and it doesn\'t \"mean\" anything to me.  I had a therapist ask me what the difference was between the two - 3 weeks later, I couldn\'t answer it.  I can come up with all the cliches in the world, or the physical differences, but I have no clue.    I\'ve been a monumental failure my whole life - I have a very high IQ (over 140), an ACT score of 34/36, and a high school GPA of 1.7, even including all the alternative classes I took on a computer.  Thanks to visiting/guest student programs, guaranteed acceptance (with test scores), and non-degree programs, I\'ve failed out of 7 schools (in 9 semesters) - from Harvard to Northwest College in Wyoming.    I can function in a sales role, or a short-term consultant, but anything else I try, I fail at.  Perversely, the more I care, the more \"noise\" is in my head.  The only way to succeed is not to care, and that only works for simple things.  I tried so hard - setting so many alarms, telling myself that I wouldn\'t go to bed until my homework was done, and would get up before class.  That\'s it - that should be all that\'s needed to pass in a community college, especially since I took only courses I was qualified to teach.    I couldn\'t do it - I would end up distracted, I would be unable to write, I would integrate my alarms into my dreams - dreaming for hours about an alarm sound, and trying desperately to find it.      Anyhow, as I look back, and read through these forums - I see a ton of similarities to myself.  I am a biased observer, though - am I perhaps seeing what I desire?  Looking at myself as objectively as I can, I match all but 2 of the DSM-IV criteria - I didn\'t have speech development issues, and I do not stim (as far as I can tell).    I have a fairly good job, but I really want to go to school, do things right.  Ultimately, what I would expect from a diagnosis, if one were made, would be others going through similar things to look at - to try what helps, as well as potentially a label - one that might make it easier for instructors to understand me.  Maybe I\'m just nuts, seeing what I want to see, but it just seems too strong a correlation to be a delusion.  Am I \"too functional\" for it to really be Autism, or am I just better at compensating than some?    <strong>I recognize that this was long, and I suspect I\'ve probably broken several rules of some sort here - too much information, off-topic, potentially offensive.  If that is the case, please let me know - I will edit (or remove) this post as appropriate.</strong></div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Now that DS is swallowing pills (thanks to Walgreens giving out pill cases at the recent Health Fair!), I\'m yearning to have all of our supplements in pill form.  It is SOOO much easier!!!  Here are the things I currently have in powder form: Klaire Ther-Biotic Complete  Kirkman Super Nu-Thera  For the Klaire probiotic, the powder has 100+ billion CFUs (per 1/4 tsp), and the capsules only have 25+ billion (per capsule).  But other than that they seem the same.  So... DS would have to swallow 4 probiotic pills, twice a day to equal what I\'m currently giving him in powder (1/4 tsp, twice a day).  That\'s a lot of pills.   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" />   For the Kirkman multi, the capsules have added calcium, but other than that they seem the same.  I\'d only have to give him 1 capsule, twice a day (compared to 1/2 tsp, twice a day)... so that\'s not too bad.  Do you have any thoughts on this?  My DAN ped is fantastic, except he doesn\'t get back to me in a timely manner at all.  So I would appreciate your input, with the concept of switching to all/most capsules.  Since he\'s so willing to swallow capsules whenever I put them in front of him, it would be SO much easier to do all pills than to have to keep sneaking powders into foods/drinks at just the right times of the day.</div>'

'<P>Hi there,</P> <P>I was wondering if I could get some feedback. BN is 7 and we had her repeat kindergarten because she had so many medical problems last year, some of which were tics related to medications and viral/strep infections. This year she continues to be in the MH room (multi-handicap room) and is integrated in the kindergarten. Well, at our last team meeting we concluded she was too overwhelmed in the kindergarten and decided she now primarily only be in the MH room. She only goes to kindergarten for a set few days 45 min. for structured play time. </P> <P>This last month, my family has been very sick with colds, stomach virus, and such. I began to notice too BN was developing tics again. So, also the behavior flared up too. Partly what motivated us to get her out of kindergarten.</P> <P>My question is this. Yesterday she was in kindergarten and they were doing an activity where they had to string pasta to make a necklace. I guess BN got frustrated and threw her scissors. They removed her from the room and she said she was sad and put a sad face symbol in her visual aide book for the day. Also, she is given a prize reward for having a good day and they did not give her a prize because she threw the scissors.</P> <P>I wrote her teacher a note stating she was not misbehaving but was frustrated. I suggested they give her a visual prompt she can use when she is overwhelmed and needs to leave the room. </P> <P>I just don\'t want to set her up for failure. We kept the kindergarten on a limited basis because the kids in the MH room don\'t talk due to their disabilities. Her special ed. teacher is working on bringing some positive peer support in the MH room like third graders at lunchtime but she needs help with social skills in other areas too. We had to pull her out of kindergarten due to her sensory needs and I know she needs to be in the MH room but what do we do for her social skills if she can\'t handle kindergarten at all?</P> <P>Thanks!</P> <P>RA </P>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">As a \"biomed\" mom so to speak, I dont believe God wants our children to be \"autistic\" or anything else for that matter that causes pain to  a little child, or their parents/family. No i dont believe autism is here to teach us something per se, except that its a reflection of what we are doing to ourselves. In that, it might be a lesson. We built the cess pitt we live in and our children are suffering. The same for obesity, diabetes, cancers and other auto immune diseases. If autism was a natural \"genetic\" abherrance, it might be different, but its not - suddenly, very suddenly in the history of time, its all around us. Something is happening to our children and its not getting any better. I believe as many do, its yet another \"auto immune\" disease.    I believe autism was caused by man. Now its here, we have to deal with it, and I feel very blessed that my boy is who he is. I dont think he \"picked\" me, so to speak, but I do believe I am his parent for a reason, in fact when i look around my friends and family, i do thank God he is my son and not my sister\'s son, or my cousin\'s son.    There is reason in the universe, there is meaning according to scripture. Its all about how you interpret that meaning.     Either the bible, Torah or Koran, etc are your \"bible\" or they are not. If you have one of these \"bibles\" and you study them and live them, life can become exceedingly clear sometimes. That, for me is another blessing.     Throughout history its children who have suffered the most and it continues to be that way. They are small, vulnerable and in most countries in the world, still do not have rights. Children are used, abused, enslaved, starved, and murdered all over the world every single day, sometimes with nary a whimper from whole communities. Autism is \"ravaging\" children in my opinion, excluding them from society, from their parents and family and threatening institutionalization for many of them, who dont get understanding and help they need. This certainly couldn\'t be God\'s plan for little children, particuarly when we know there is help available. The fact that children are not getting the help they need is a \"sin\" indeed, the governments are culpable in this.     Autism is one more assault upon children, one they are \"suffering\" because our whole world appears to be ignoring the fact that what we do to our world and and to ourselves, we do to our children, present and future.     \"Do onto others\" and \"love thy neighbour\" clearly has meaning, but very little practice in today\'s world, regarding our children. Pharma companies and the doctors who kiss their butts are not loving their neighbour when they shove drugs down little children\'s throats to keep them quiet and numbed.     Injecting mercury into babies is not \"doing onto others\" either. Forcing parents to re-mortgage their homes and put them in constant perpetual turmoil about \"what to do, how to help\" is not \"doing onto others\" either.     In my own opinion, the world is currently a shite hole and autism pales in comparison to the millions of people losing their family members to senseless wars.

'I can see keeping him out if he was just DX\'d. I don\'t think it\'s a mistake. You can (if this is your plan) get his therapies started, get him really strong for a year with some quality therapies, and then enter him into the school system. You could do the IEP first and see what they suggest. And you don\'t have to enter K until you are 6 so you do have that play in his start date. There are so many opportunities for socialization skills with our kids that aren\'t school based. Get him the chance for socialization practice even if you choose to wait a year.'

'<P>The schools are responsible for helping a child grow in more than academic ways. ALL kids learn social skills in school, so the schools are responsible for helping any child who is NOT learning social skills naturally. Get the doctor\'s diagnosis first and then call an advocate. It\'s much harder to get some schools to address the issues when a child is older and getting \"good grades.\" Once he has an autism spectrum diagnosis, he can be classified as educationally autistic. At that point, you can ask that an autism consultant be brought in to educate all teachers and staff on how to deal with your son\'s issues. </P> <P>Unfortunately, bullying happens. Yes, there are school policies against it, but it STILL happens. Especially to higher functioning ASD kids who are in the general school population. It\'s human nature to reject people who are different, so it\'s important for ASD kids to try to pass as the same. They need to learn social skills and language pragmatics so that they don\'t bring extra attention to their differences. It might be nice if everyone accepted \"diversity\" but that is a dream (ask any black kid in a predominantly white school). The fact is, the more our kids act different, the more they will be picked on. Furthermore, if they act \"different\" when they are adults, they will not be able to keep a job. By middle school age, it\'s imperative that our kids get the right kind of counseling to help them learn to act in socially acceptable ways. For example, it\'s simply not socially acceptable to not look at the person you\'re talking to and continue to hold forth on a bizarre topic that is only of interest to YOU. This is taken by peers as showing off and trying to make THEM look stupid. ASD kids who do this must be taugtht NOT to do this. The world is not going to change for them.</P> <P>That said, it\'s vital that you get your son help in school. He needs to learn how to act but also to get protection until his can learn those things. The example I gave above might not apply to your son at all, but there ARE reasons he is getting picked on. The school needs to STOP the bullying, but they also need to teach your son how to act in a way that is less likely to bring on bullying. You may also be able to get him special ed transportation on a mini bus once he gets his diagnosis. Try to access an advocate or lawyer to help you with this. It is NOT going to be easy, but you WILL eventually prevail. Keep us posted.</P>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I don\'t like taking my child off of supplements because she just isn\'t the same child. Even her teachers notice it.   She\'s weepy, irritable, not as talkative and when she does talk her speech isn\'t as clear.      Our kids have a broken biochemistry and location of those breaks is different for each child but in general the supplements help them to feel better, think better, understand the world better. I know my daughter just doesn\'t feel as good if we take her off her daily supplements and when she doesn\'t feel as good she\'s easily frustrated and emotional.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">My son Joey is 3.5. He was recently diagnosed as having PDD. The dev pediatrician we who diagnosed him told us at 18 months that he was just â€œdelayedâ€, at 24 months she said he was definitely not PDD, now, 40 months she gave him a PDD diagnosis but added as a caveat â€œimproving with intensive therapyâ€(?)). </div>  We have a \"Joey\" here, too, and that was about the time we received our diagnosis of PDD-NOS as well, although it was more  like 4 years old.

We started ABA about 15 hrs per week at 4, and lots of biomed, including the gfcf diet and now the SCD diet.   <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">He was getting about 15 hours a week of ST, ABA and OT until he turned 3 in Feb. Since then he has been in an all day preschool for special needs children. He is very vocal and frequently asks for things (juice, cookie, etc) he also asks us to engage him in activities (drawing, making animal sounds, flying around like an airplane, singing, etc). He can label most any object, knows all his letters, their sounds and all numbers up to 40. He has a pretty good sense of humor and great eye contact when he wants to, he eats most foods and doesnâ€™t really have any behavior problems.  Would a child with PDD behave this way? </div>  Yes, because it\'s mainly a language and speech disorder, at least w/ our son who is also very socially engaged and academically ok.   [quote}On the negative side, he repeats lines from TV, movies, computer games, stuff his teachers say, stuff we say, constantly (and I mean constantly). Also he never socializes with other kids, has loads of anxiety and very often ignores us (unless he wants something). He also cannot answer any open ended question like (what is your teacherâ€™s name, or did you got to school today? He usually just answers â€œyesâ€ to anything. He knows what yes and no mean, but canâ€™t answer a yes/no question. Does receptive language for these abstract concepts ever improve? [/quote]    Yes, I know it can for many kids. Our son has improved immensely since 4 w/ (he is turning 5 in August) the right ABA therapy. He now answers the questions, adds in a \"because\" explantion . .(it is so cute), and we actually are conversing now quite well with him. He still scripts also alot, but it\'s more of a developmental thing which I can now see looking back over the past year. I mean, the echolalia thing was crazy, but he worked his way through it and it\'s a thing of the  past. there are time he still ignores what we\'re saying, and there are times he\'s quite engaged. Overall I\'d say concentrate on ABA and biomed, and know that in a year from now, it will be quite different. At this point, I\'m very excited to see him in another year, and I have great hope.

' <div class=\"postbody\">DS 19mo. DX @ 18mo high functioning autism.  Regression started at 16-17months. Had 3 words prior to 16 months. Good eye contact. Started repetitive items around 13 months of age shortly after his 12 month series of vaccines.   As we jumped on this very quick even before any DX we seemed to have stopped the regression and in fact has been improving.    We started him on the GFCF diet against the recommendations of Kasier. Kasier offers NOTHING in terms of treatment yet they prefer we do not give him any treatment other than the Los Angeles Regional Center which STILL has not kicked in yet (meet case worker Monday). In fact even though the internal Kasier website (I took  a peak while I was waiting for the doc-45 minutes late) mentions that a GFCF diet has shown in studies to improve symptoms in autistic children the social development doctor for Kasier did not believe in it. In fact she was surprised when I even mentioned in was in there. Probably since removed from their website.    Anyhow the first week off of casein manifested itself very positively for our boy. He started clapping to music, interacted with himself in the mirror, more verbal (no words), better eye contact, and waved for the first time since very young. We also started ChilLife cod liver oil in his diet-YUCK!    We started the gluten free diet 2 weeks after stopping casein. No immediate results with the gluten diet but most tend to say that the effects takes up to several months. We are determined parents.     2 weeks ago we met with our DAN doctor for a 4 hour consultation and action plan. He is also a well respected MD at a major hospital and his own son is now a recovered autistic. This also included an at home stool sample and urine test as he believed our baby to be yeasty (white tongue, hand flapping, etc). We are waiting on the results.     We started him on Kirkmans TMG and calcium for 4 days. We then added probiotics (1/4 teaspoon at first for the 1st 4 days, then Â½ for 4 days, then 1 full teaspoon though we are not there yet).   He started having a runny nose and a low grade fever (99.1) along with irritability which the consensus is yeast die off. We picked up some Charco Caps Avticated Charcoal from Walgreens (they have two skus, only one is activated).   We only gave him Â½ of a capsule mixed with water and a plunger. 30 minutes later and all was fine. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\" /> He also has been taken (WE have been taken as it is the only way he will sit in the tub) Epson salt baths.     We have Kirkmans Super-Nu-Thera but we are holding off till tomorrow before giving it to him as I want to add up the Vitamin A count from all of the sources first.    Anyhow, with everything above and of course much love this is where we are at in only 4-5 weeks of treatment.    He not only claps to music interactively but now dances. He loves it.    He really enjoys wrestling with me on the bed. Very interactive socially with us.    His motor skills have always been pretty good but are now better. He tosses the ball to mama or dada whichever is called out. â€œThrow ball to mama.â€    He is getting better at recognizing when his parents emotions have changed. He knew this before but lost it completely.     He is not  scared about things such as me picking him up and raising him up high. It would freak him out after the regression period. He now laughs and smiles.    He is now picking up on his verbal communication quicker and quicker it seems recently. He not only can say dog, shoe, chips, dada, socks but says them spontaneously to associate the words in real life without first hearing it from myself or the wife. This is big for us. In fact I recently posted about speech as we were worried he may not have any. He seems to be on a good path.    The day he took his first probiotic was the first time in memory he took a 2 hour nap without waking in the middle. Plus he awoke in a pleasant mood. Now he not  since done that but we are hopeful that the rest periods will go longer without interruption as his body gets over the yeast problem that is obviously bothering him.    He is better at waving though still shys away half the time.   Better than nothing.    His frustration level is much better now as before he would get upset when his blocks fell after stacking them. Now he is nowhere as upset and sometimes just walks away when they fall.    He is also much more playful these days and seems to enjoy life.    He is now open to eating more items which is good as it makes it easier to hide his calcium.     The bad: He still dumps out his blocks and puts them back in over and over, just not as much as before. In fact he will walk away and play with other things now.    He still opens the cabinets and pulls out items (safe items) and puts them back in. Over and over and over. Just not as often as before. Very little hand banging when upset now. Less than before.    Well, I explained all of this to the our Kaiser rep who told me it was a coincidence and there was no medical proof to back up any of the treatment. I told her SO WHAT! The proof is in my child and what everyone around us has seen. He has developed more mentally now than in the past 6 months. All within 1 month! She still is not willing to believe and says that it was just his time to reach milestones. Some people will never get it but who cares. When my son is 10 years of age and playing some sports and doing well academically I will care less what a ,â€autism expertâ€ at a hospital told me.     Anyhow, I wanted to post as I understand how difficult it can be for so many parents going through the same thing. At first when we were told we felt it would be similar to a jail setence. I cried, had to take pills to relieve the anxiety and work suffered. But now we not only see hope, we are experiencing recovery right in front of us. We did not listen to others including family and friends that said he was just delayed. We ignored the Kasier doctors when time after time they were proven wrong. We listened to ourselves and our son is much better off because of this and we will continue to treat him regardless of the financial strain it will put on us. We already sold one car and are prepared to downgrade the one of the other cars. My kidneys will be for sale also if needed. Through it all I have studied ,read, listened to both sides, and researched for hundreds of hours. I went over to autismspeaks (which I now boycott) and read and watched every video. Googled everything I could on autism and treatment. I watched all of the recovery videos on various websites for hope. I studied every treatment he received to weigh the pros and cons as we continue this battle for our darling son.    So if you are coming here for the first time afraid of what lies ahead, have hope and perseverance.  Every child responds differently but I feel we got to ours just in time. The sooner the better, there is never a reason to delay treatment.    If we do not look after the best interest of our children, who will? They rely on us. I will post more as time allows.     Thank you.     <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /></div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I would start with epsom salt baths and see what reaction your daughter has. Please post back!  The other thing I would try if she still seems very stressed after trying magnesium is Holy Basil extract capsules from New Chapter (our Whole Foods carries it and can special order also). Holy Basil brings down cortisol levels and is very calming for my daughter and for me. I use it during die off during the day to keep stress level OK, and I use at night to help us fall asleep. If you give it during the day and it makes her tired, then she\'s had too much. If it just calms her down, it\'s just right. But please understand this is a stop gap measure until you find the cause of her problems. It\'s a bandaid (but a very helpful one).  Yeast test: Our DAN used the Genova MAP test which uses Arabinose as an indicator of yeast infection. There are other tests from other labs (Great Plains, Genova) that also use this method. Other tests are stool tests (CDSA) that look for presence of pathenogenic organisms. You need a Dr. to order these tests. Some regular peds might do this, if not then try an alternative health care practitioner (like a Naturopathic Doctor or ND or Doctor of Osteopathy DO).   To try to guess presence of yeast/bacteria etc yourself based on symptoms you can look at this thread: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.autismweb.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=13885\">http://www.autismweb.com/forum/viewtopi ... =7&amp;t=13885</a><!-- m -->  Or you can also do a trial of S boullardi probiotic, start with micro amount. I started my daughter with 1/5 of a 1 billion capsule and she had die off from that. If she has a reaction to this (feeling better, feeling worse) then she has yeast. S boullardi is a beneficial yeast that outcompetes bad yeast (kills it). I wouldn\'t try this until after you get her more calmed down first.

'The most important thing for your child to have under her belt before kindergarten are FUNCTIONAL things. Like potty (tho not being trained cannot keep her out of regular K), and being able to sit in her seat for periods of time and being able to follow at least two-step directions and being able to wait her turn and to take turns. I would not worry about academics. One thing mainstream school are GOOD at is teaching academics AS LONG AS THE CHILD HAS THOSE OTHER ATTENDING SKILLS. It\'s often difficult to get mainstream schools to help with functional and social skills, so I\'d focus on those in pre-K.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Here is a review of a presentation by Michael Fabrizio (very well-known in the field of ABA), entitled <em>Voting With Their Feet: Incorporating Student Choice,</em> published in a FEAT CT newsletter.  His presentation addressed many of the concerns raised in this thread, and also demonstrates the evolution of thought in the ABA realm as applied to the treatment of children with autism:    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"> Presentation Review : CT FEAT Winter 2005 Newsletter    Voting with their Feet:Incorporating Student Choice    By Michael Fabrizio     (Reviewed by Danusia Pawska, BCABA)    Though offering choice to students with disabilities is a widely accepted method of reducing resistance to instruction, learners are not usually given the choice of whether or not they want to be taught.   Children are usually given a choice of their reinforcers, what activity to do next or sometimes when to take a brief break, but often they are expected to get through a teaching program whether they like it or not.   According to Michael Fabrizio, BCBA, allowing students with disabilities the choice to say no to instruction is a critical aspect of quality educational services.  In his presentation \"Voting with their Feet: Incorporating Student Choice\", Fabrizio offered a practical and data-based approach to increasing skills without using coercive teaching procedures.  Fabrizio, who presented his inspiring lecture at the Going Beyond Expectations: Unique Solutions in Autism Education conference on October 5, 2005 in Cromwell, Connecticut, is a leader in the field of applied research for teaching children with autism, and an expert in the application of fluency-based instruction.   <strong>The premise of Fabrizio\'s presentation was that individuals with disabilities have the right to give their consent to treatment and to withdraw that consent at any time, as stated in Guidelines for Responsible Conduct for Behavior Analysts.</strong> Children with disabilities, however, don\'t have the legal capacity to give informed consent, so Fabrizio used the term \"assent\" in his discussion to mean \"to agree to something freely\".  While there is no ethical requirement for assent by minors involved in ABA treatment, Fabrizio believes this is implied in the professional guidelines.   Fabrizio shared the results of a study in which a student was taught specific requests to escape instructional programs.  The student\'s â€œwithdrawals of assentâ€ were measured, graphed, and displayed on the same graphs as his instructional programs.  In this way his teachers could correlate the child\'s learning behavior with adjustments to instruction. Escape-motivated behaviors decreased to 0 instances per month while the student\'s skills increased.     <strong>The idea that children should remain happy while we teach them is not new to ABA instruction; however, is it not shared by all behavior analysts.  Some recommend that you \"work through problem behavior\", \"establish compliance\" and never reinforce escape-motivated behavior because you will only make it happen more often in the future.   According to Fabrizio, we should not worry about reinforcing escape-motivated behavior because it will be reinforced, one way or another.  Children will find ways to escape aversive tasks whether it\'s through overt rebellion, or covertly, like when they avoid us, answer carelessly, or tune us out altogether.   Fabrizio suggests that we should view these types of escape-motivated responses from our children as feedback on our teaching.  When we allow children to escape from instruction, we get valuable information to help us improve our teaching and provide a more successful learning environment for that student.  When teaching is good, learners are reinforced by success and want to keep going</strong>.     <strong>Fabrizio offered ways to reduce escape behaviors in instructional settings.</strong> Adjustments to the elements of instruction should be made based on data and our moment to moment interactions with children.  If a reinforcer isn\'t strong, we might have to find a better one.  If the pace of teaching is too slow, we might speed it up.  If a task is too easy, we might make it harder, increase the range of examples we\'re teaching or use all new examples.  If a task is too hard, we might try breaking it down into smaller steps or making it easier.  However, he warns that making tasks easier is frequently used and often not effective.   <strong>As I thought about this presentation, certain mottoes about teaching came to mind: The learner is always right; Children don\'t fail to learn, we fail to teach them; Behavior is a functional relationship between the individual and the environment.   We as parents and teachers are the child\'s environments.  Sometimes we need to change our own behavior so our children can learn what we intend to teach them. </strong> It is our responsibility to make learning appropriate and fun, and to keep our interactions with learners as efficient and positive as possible.   The presentation has already begun to change my behavior as a parent and as an educator.  I\'m more aware of my son\'s emotional reactions when I make demands of him.  Like many kids with ASD, he has challenges in the area of organization and self-management.  Sometimes he responds negatively when I ask him to do a particular task or chore.  Now when I see those negative reactions, I ask myself, why is that task aversive to him?  Did I really teach him how to do it or have I just told him what to do and assumed that he could do it?  Did I give him enough support and practice to become really good at what I expected him to do? I\'ve resolved to do more chores with him, to teach him the steps carefully and to make it fun.   Likewise, I find myself trying to be more analytical when a student seems bored or is experiencing some stress.  Giving the student a choice in whether to continue or not helps me to know I\'m not causing him or her undue discomfort, or becoming aversive to the child. That assurance makes teaching more reinforcing for me.    Fabrizioâ€™s presentation also reminded me of a favorite passage in the book, â€œThe Morningside Model of Generative Instructionâ€, written by Drs. Kent Johnson and Elizabeth Street.  Programs are evaluated on the basis of their ability to produce happy, competent learners who are naturally reinforced by progressâ€¦[we] strive for a path through the curriculum that makes each successive task at least as easy as the one that preceded it and a path that prevents or repairs the effects of historic failure. Michael Fabrizio performed a valuable service by bringing this message to parents of children with autism and the intervention community that serves them.

I was thinking about enrolling dd in a local Christian school and keeping ds at home to work with him. He is doing so great right now though, and you should hear him read the book, &quot;If You Give A Mouse A Cookie.&quot;  It\'s so cute!  I know he\'s mostly reading from memorization, but his pronunciation gets better and better every day and this is his favorite book right now. He loves the part where the mouse remembers &quot;he\'s firsty&quot; haha (thirsty)  Don\'t want to say anything to jinx us (knock on wood.) But I think you\'re going to be much happier since you\'re following your intuition about what\'s best.  Even with no babysitter and no &quot;break.&quot; sigh.  There is the link for the &quot;Time4Learning.com&quot; website that is an online homeschool computer program that we tried for a couple of months over the summer, you should check it out even if it\'s only for part time.

Parent\'s Need to Know:   How Much Information About Bullies Should a School Provide?   by Pete and Pam Wright     \"I am a special education teacher. A child with disabilities was the victim of bullies. The bullies faced consequences, including their parents being called. The parent of the bullied child wanted to know who the bullies are, what the consequences were, and what happened at a meeting with their parents. It felt like the bullies were becoming the victims.\"    \"How much information about other students is too much to share with the parent of another child?\"    Unknown to each other, Pete Wright and Pam Wright responded to this teacher\'s email. What did they say? How different was their advice in this situation?    Pam said:     You need to step into this parent\'s shoes. Assume you just learned that your child had been bullied by other students. How would you respond? I\'m sure you would be upset - frightened and angry.     Wouldn\'t you want to know who the bullies are? Do they live in your neighborhood? Do they live on your street? Do they ride the bus with your child? Do they attend the same classes?    Exactly what did the bullies do to your child? How long did the bullying go on? Who knew about it? When did they know? Whom did they tell?     What punishment did the bullies receive from the school? What steps has the school taken to ensure that your child will not experience bullying again?     Now, imagine that the school staff told you, \"the consequences including their parents being called.\" Nothing more.    As a parent, would you be satisfied because the school called the bullies\' parents?     The bullying took place at school. As a parent, you have a right to know who bullied your child, what they did, who knew about it, how long it went on, how the school dealt with the bullies, what punishment, if any, was meted out, and what the school is doing to ensure that your child will be safe.    If the school refuses to provide this information, will you feel confident that school personnel will protect your child in the future? If you return your child to school, will you feel confident that your child will be safe?     How can bullies be viewed as \"victims\" because you as the parent need information and straight answers before you can have any confidence that your child will be safe at school?     If the school refused to provide this information and assurances that your child will be safe from bullies, would you lose trust in the school\'s willingness to protect your child?    Trust is fragile. Once trust is broken, it may never be regained.     Pete said:     Change the facts. Your child attends a summer camp. He was severely beaten up by another camper and hospitalized. Camp officials refused to release any information about the aggressor and what steps they took, if any.     As a parent, how would you feel about this? Would you be satisfied?    Change facts again. Your child attends a private school. He was assaulted by another student and is now in the hospital. You want to press charges against the attacker. The private school staff refuse to release any information about the aggressor, including his identity.    As a parent, how would you feel about this? Would you be satisfied?    Change facts again. Your child was assaulted at the local mall. The mall security were involved. Security did not notify you, nor did they call the police. You didn\'t know about the assault until your child walked in the door and told you.    As a parent, how would you feel about this? Would you be satisfied?    In all these scenarios in which trusted individuals refuse to release information about our child, what will the parent assume? The parent will assume that the authorities are protecting the bullies, the aggressors, who hurt their child.     Parents have a right to know that their child was hurt and who hurt their child. They have a right to know what steps the school has taken, if any, to prevent the behavior from occurring again. When a school does anything less, this will be viewed as a cover-up. It will appear that the school has a policy of doing nothing to protect vulnerable students from bullies.    This perception may close to reality.    Resources    The Bully, the Bullied, and the Bystander: From Preschool to High School --How Parents and Teachers Can Help Break the Cycle of Violence     Author Barbara Coloroso describes a deadly triad - bullies who terrorize, bullied kids who are afraid to tell, bystanders who watch, participate, or look away - and adults who dismiss the incidents as a \"normal part of childhood.\"     This book describes three kinds of bullying; steps to take if your child is a bully; four abilities to protect your child; how to help a bullied child heal and effectively discipline the bully; and how to evaluate your school\'s anti-bullying policy.    Bullying Prevention Handbook: A Guide for Principals, Teachers, and Counselors - This comprehensive book for understanding, preventing, and reducing bullying describes effective teaching and counseling methods including:  - a step-by-step bullying intervention model that can be implemented in schools, agencies and communities;  -strategies that teachers, administrators, and counselors can use in work with bullies and their scapegoats;  - assessment and evaluation tools;  -strategies to improve the families of bullies and scapegoats.    Although the Bullying Prevention Handbook is described as \"a guide for principals, teachers and counselors,\" it is recommended for parents as well. Concerned, informed parents are often a necessary catalyst for schools to implement effective violence-prevention programs.</div>'

'<P>Oh fred,</P> <P>Yes the teacher that was there and the sub are aware of his diagnosis. It is an NT preschool but I am sure that there are other children there with IEP\'s. Usually there is another child or 2 but they don\'t disclose that information to me ever. Usually find out from other parents. As Far as I know ...NO...he will not be getting 1:1 anymore here. That is one of my concerns. Will he still do well without pull out? They looked over his IEP initally and stated that The reg ed teacher can handle the specifics of the IEP as far as academics are concerned so he won\'t be getting pull out anymore. He will still be getting speech and OT for now. At his last school they even tried to take away speech so I don\'t know what is going to happen here. I guess my biggest fear about all of this is that even though he did ok today...what if he doesn\'t do so well without the extra help? I feel like I\'m walking a tight rope blindfolded. SOme of this is due to my own fear of change I realize that.

'<h2>New at Lisa Jo Rudy\'s autism.about.com blog:<br> </h2> <br> Good News! Early Spoken Language is NOT a Key to Positive Outcomes in Autism <div =\"date\">Friday June 6, 2008</div> <div =\"entry\"><br> I\'m going to write several articles based on a recent interview with Dr. James Coplan, a developmental pediatrician specializing in autism. But before I do, I just have to share a few points that he clarified for me - because I believe they are of critical importance to parents of young children.<p> When I contacted Dr. Coplan, I asked him specifically about prognosis and autism. That is - how do we know whether a child will do well or poorly over time? Like many people, I had always assumed that a child\'s ability to use spoken language was a key to a positive prognosis.</p><p> I was wrong.</p><p> Dr. Coplan explained what I suppose I really did already know: that spoken language is only one way for human beings to communicate, and it\'s by no means the most basic - nor the most significant when it comes to measuring intelligence or anticipating longterm outcomes. In fact, as he explained, many children with autism may be extremely delayed in use of spoken language, for many reasons (physical problems among them). </p><p> Much more critical than spoken language, he explained, is use of ANY tools for communication. If your child takes your hand to guide you, he is communicating. If he uses gestures, he is communicating. If he can master picture cards, signs, or other methods of connecting with another human being, he is communicating.</p><p> Said Dr. Coplan, \"You shouldn\'t use language as the rock to stand on to estimate a child\'s intelligence, because you\'re likely to grossly underestimate his intelligence.... [The] ability to develop spoken language varies as a result of physical and/or language disorders; but a prognosis or a measure of IQ is not dependent upon spoken language.\"</p><p> \"They used to say \'if they\'re not talking by five it\'s a bad sign,\'\" said Dr. Coplan. Today, though, we understand that communication, intelligence and verbal ability are not one and the same. Even if your child is not talking, there\'s a good chance that his intelligence - and long term prognosis - may both be very good.</p><p> Just had to share this, as it struck me as being a real gold nugget of information for parents.<br> <br> </p></div> < =\"text/\"> z160=zpreC(160,600);z336=zpreC(336,280);z728=zpreC(728,90);z 155=zpreC(336,155);zItw=160 <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Norway Mom (mother of 2 sons who were born in 1998 and 2001.

My son is 35 lbs and we are doing 250mg 2x daily and it seems to be working fine at that dose. I have heard some people to 250mg 3x daily and some do 2x daily. Our DAN! told us 250mg 2x daily so that is why we started with that. The truth is even the researchers don\'t know exactly why Valtrex works for some kids and not for others but the only way to know for your child is to try. I wish there was a more helpful answer than that, but like with everything we are all just trying to find the puzzle piece that fits with our child.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Well, it looks like Joey\'s dad is going to have to deploy this summer, and sooner than later. They dragged us around w/ the orders, but just came out w/ the news this past week. No other choices for us but a 12-month tour in Kuwait for him.    This is something we knew there was a chance for, but we had always hoped the military would find a place for him to stay here local, but it looks like w/ the needs of the military right now, it isn\'t going to happen. No one in the military seems to give a c--- that our son has special needs or is so young, or anything at all. No special consideration whatsoever.    I am feeling so distraught. Joey needs his Dad. My older son needs his Dad. I need his Dad. I\'m worried what it will do to Joey over a year. I\'m worried because I have absolutely no family in the area, very little support from extended family, and my kids are all just a LOT of work.    And, then, of course, I\'m graduating from nursing school in August, am suppposed to study for and take the NCLEX, and start a new career, just weeks after he will leave.    I just don\'t see HOW all this has to come down on me NOW. I am almost 45 years old . ..and I\'ve got more responsibility now on my shoulders than ever before.     I\'ve so wanted to concentrate on Joey and to work harder on the biomed stuff, but now I\'m not sure I can do it all, or if I can put into it what I need. I am also scheduled for an RDI conference in June, so it figures that it will all fall on me to implement it over the year.    I\'m also worried about bad days. Last night Joey threw at least three tantrums in a row, and I was about to lose it. If Dad hadn\'t been there, I don\'t know what I would have done.     I need a number to call or someone to talk to when things are going roughly. I need a live in who can really, really support me this year. I need it all.

I am not suggesting people don\'t have another child, but I do understand their concerns. </div>  Grandma C., I do understand, it is one of the reasons we\'ve waited to have another kid, and honestly, S. appears to most people to NT at this point.  A genetic counselor told us if we had a boy, he has a 1 in 10 chance of having with ASD,  1 in 5 chance of having a learning disability, and 1 in 3 chance of having speech delays.(Chances are lower for a girl).  This is based on our family histories.  Of course, there is no telling where a child would fall on the spectrum.    The comment made by DH\'s cousin, wasn\'t concern, it was to imply that S. was burden on his family and on society.  She considers all disabled people burden and she worked in special ed. She has since changed careers.</div>    Well, then I\'m glad she\'s changed careers. If she considers people with disabilities a burden on society, well that\'s rude, b ut I\'m still glad she changed careers.    I still think it\'s rude though. What about the strengths that come with certain disabilities as well? Does she not look for the strengths? Or only the weaknesses?    My autism causes me to have a very good memory, especially for areas of interest. People with Aspergers/ High funtioning autism tend to make very good employees because they most likely go in the field where their interest lies. And people with HFA/Aspergers are very knowledgeable in their field, and are practically experts. I know there are certain weaknesses that come with ASD\'s, but why not focus on the strengths instead? Maybe you should try to convince your husbands cousin to have a different attitude.

'Hi Out There, <br /> <br />I\'m pretty new to the forum so I have mostly been reading. Even just <br />reading problems and responses has been very helpful. <br /> <br />My 5 year old son (ASD and ADHD) does not eat very many foods, he will <br />only touch a few things. If not for infant formula, which he will still drink, <br />I think he would be malnourished. Our nutrition problem is that he gets <br />constipated sometimes and has a very tough time. We have actually had <br />to give him enemas when it gets bad (try that with a strong young ASD <br />boy!). For the past year or so he will eat some of the new yoghurt that has <br />fiber added, which keeps him regular. Recently he has not been eating <br />this however and we are worried about him. <br /> <br />Does anyone have this problem also? We would like to give him all healthy <br />and wonderful foods but he won\'t eat them! Also I have a friend with two <br />ASD sons who will eat only McDonald\'s french fries, that\'s it, and they <br />survive on protein shakes. I am worried that if he stops drinking formula <br />he will not be getting any vitamins and other nutrients. <br /> <br />Are there any ideas regarding regularity that will work with ASD kids? <br /> <br />Thanks very much! <br /> <br />jonsfca<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Father of R age 5 ASD</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">It seems that those of you who feel you have gotten good vaccine information from your doctors got this information in the last few years? If so, you can probably thank the ruckus that many autism groups made about vaccines about five to seven years ago for the increased attention to vaccine information by doctors. That\'s good news!  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />     I got my kids vaccinated in the mid to late 1990s and there was nothing in the way of information. I don\'t know if my kids\' doctor has started to provide more information because we don\'t vaccinate anymore.    By the way, I don\'t think he was withholding information but rather just not bothering to provide it and not considering whether vaccines would be dangerous to some kids in his practice. We still see him. He\'s a good man. He just took whatever the AAP told him to do at face value without researching or questioning it. He may have changed in response to parental concerns. He certainly doesn\'t push vaccines on us anymore.    I am glad to hear that some of you feel that the system has changed in favor of more information.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Two years ago this month my son was diagnosed with autism.  It has been a long, tiring two years and I just wanted to give an update on how we got to the diagnosis and how he is doing todayâ€¦I apologize this is so long, I hope youâ€™ll read it to the end.    I started to really suspect there was a problem when my son was 15 months old.  By this time, he was very quiet, had no words/rarely babbled and didnâ€™t always respond to his name.  I asked the pediatrician if he could have autism (somehow, I just KNEW) but I was patted on the head, told not to worry, and sent on my way.  At 18 months old we agreed to a  hearing test (it came back normal as I knew it would) and was told that his older sibling was probably talking for him and we needed to not anticipate his needs but wait for him to ask (guess what, he NEVER asked!) for things.  At 2 years old when my son was still not talking my husband and I got him into speech therapy and he was diagnosed with Apraxia (Whew, I thought but with a lump in my throat).  By this time we noticed that he had developed some odd mannerismsâ€”hand flapping, lining up toys, spinning cups, didnâ€™t particularly like to be held, had very little eye contact and was beginning to tantrum excessively.  Our family (you know, all the people that NEVER saw him) thought we were being ridiculous and over protective.  They advised that he was just being a typical two year old and by the way, Einstein didnâ€™t even talk until he was four!! (yeah, guess what, Einstein PROBABLY had some form of autism).  After 3 months of speech therapy with virtually no improvement we pushed for an appointment with a developmental pediatrician and child psychologist and waited another 4 months for an appointment with them.  Between the time that I started suspecting autism and the time my son was finally diagnosed was nearly 1 Â½ years.  (Iâ€™m still kicking myself for that one).     When my son was diagnosed with mild to moderate autism at 2.7 years old my world was shattered.  I had the usual preconceived notions of what autism meant and my heart broke for my boy.  What would his life be like?  What if he never spoke?  Would he have friends?  Would he marry?  Who would care for him after his dad and I were gone?  His future looked uncertain and I was scared.  I immediately was put in touch with an awesome ABA consultant and started a home based ABA program within two weeks (we were VERY lucky).  My husband and I did all the therapy under the direction of the consultant.  It was exhausting.  Fast forward to nowâ€¦..    If the average person were to see my son out in public they would never know he is on the spectrum.  He is now fully verbal, has learned to play with friends, and is a happy, charming, and funny little boy.  He is in a Special Ed preschool and is on track to mainstream kindergarten next year with probably very little supports.  We still have work to do, and heâ€™s still a little quirky but we are SO much further ahead than where I thought we would be when we received the diagnosis two years back.      How did we get there?  For us, I think most of our gains were due to ABA.  We tried GFCF for more than 6 months and saw virtually no change in his behavior.  We did some â€œlightâ€ detox with glutathione cream, supplements, fish oil, etc.  I donâ€™t really know if that helped or not and we have dropped many of the supplements.  The only therapy that I KNOW worked was ABA because the data doesnâ€™t lie.  I thank God everyday that we were able to hook up with a consultant that really knows her stuff!  I think my son did well with ABA because he didnâ€™t have a lot of the gut/yeast problems that many of these kids have which can interfere with therapy sessions.  And for that I am grateful!    If anyone would have told me 2 years ago that my son would have accomplished by now what he has, I would never have believed them.  And if a newly diagnosed parent were to ask me what to do, this is what I would say:    NEWLY DIAGNOSED--TEN THINGS THIS AUTISM MOM WANTS YOU TO KNOW:    1) Follow your gut:  You know your child more than anyone else in the world.  It doesnâ€™t matter who has the P.H.D.â€”you have the M.O.M. (or D.A.D.).  Push for a proper diagnosis as early as possible, thatâ€™s the first step in getting help.    2) Use what works, throw away the rest:  Be open to different types of therapies.  I am definitely an advocate of ABA but it isnâ€™t a good fit for everyone.  GFCF did absolutely nothing to help my boy but I know that it has helped others.  Just be sure to READ and RESEARCH as much as you can on ANY therapy before you dive in to something blindly.  Get references and talk to those families before making a decision on a type of therapy.  Try as much as you can to keep your objectivity.  If it sounds like a miracle cure, it probably isnâ€™t.    3) Be accepting of your child, no matter what:  I sometimes have to stop and remind myself that while he is still behind in many areas and he isnâ€™t as comfortable in social situations as I wish he were that these are MY wishes, not his.  He is a happy little boy and that is everything I can hope for as a parent.      4) NEVER EVER EVER give up:  When I heard the diagnosis I was panicked and scared but I knew we had a mountain to climb and we couldnâ€™t waste any more time.  My son has worked so hard, the least I can do is work hard right along with him.  You WILL get exhausted.  Give yourself a short break to regroup, but get right back into things.    5) Educate yourself on anything and everything about autism:  There are opposing views on every aspect of autism.  SOMEBODY is right.  God willing, some day we will know the causes and how to cure autism.  Knowledge really is power.  You donâ€™t have to agree with everything you hear, but allow yourself to at least hear it!    6) Donâ€™t waste your time justifying the diagnosis because itâ€™s a waste of your energy:  We have had people tell us that â€œhe CANâ€™T have autism, he doesnâ€™t â€œLOOKâ€ autisticâ€.  These are the same people that were no where to be found when I had a 3 year old that couldnâ€™t talk and spun cups half the day.  My advice is to spend less time with these people and more time with other friends who are supportive.    7) Continue to read this board.  I have learned a TON from this board.  Both from the parents as well as those who post here who have autism (GTTO, you have given me so much insight and helped me with acceptance more than you will ever know!)     <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\" /> Read the book â€œThereâ€™s a Boy in Hereâ€ by Judy Barron and Sean Barron.  This is probably the best book Iâ€™ve read about autism because itâ€™s written from the perspective of both the parent as well as the child with autism.  This book changed my entire outlook on my son and what things must feel like from his perspective.    9) Count your blessings:  Donâ€™t spend so much time worrying about what your child CANâ€™T do that you forget what they CAN do.  Celebrate the victories no matter how â€œsmallâ€.  And nurture and develop the strengths your child has.    10) Remember that autism is not a death sentence:  Far from it!  Being the parent of a child with autism has made me a better mother.  It has allowed me to appreciate the simplest things that most parents take for granted.  While I would never have wished for this, autism has provided me with gifts I would not have otherwise received.    I still worry some about my sonâ€™s future.  Gosh, some days I even cry.  But I know heâ€™ll be one of the success stories.  I know heâ€™ll be happy, he will have friends, he will be loved.  And thatâ€™s whatâ€™s most important to me.      Thanks for reading this far, God bless all of you, and keep on keeping on.

'My son is required to read X number of books each semester. He is very slow at reading. It is written in his IEP that he only has to do half the requirement. He does some reading with the special ed teacher, but he also does it at home. Depending on what the spec ed is helping him with he may not have time to always do his reading at school. I find it important for Adam to read at home. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Dawn mom of Adam age 14 - PDD NOS, ADD, Anexity disorder. Also two NT kids ages 11 and 9.</div>'
'This is a very funny thread. And do you all realize that what we are <br />experiencing here is NT behavior? ALL kids do this! The difference is <br />that once they know better, our kids have more difficulty controlling their <br />impulse to use a scripted swear phrase. My DS (almost 11) knows he <br />shouldn\'t swear, and we try to be good around him. One of his favorite <br />shows is \"Futurama\" and anyone who has ever seen it knows that Bender, <br />the robot can be pretty crass. This past weekend, DS was over at a <br />friends house. The two boys had a disagreement, and low and behold, DS <br />tells his friend to \"bite my shiny metal ass\". The friend told me about this <br />when I picked up DS. DS was mortified and terrified that he would be in <br />serious trouble. He\'s such a stickler for rules, that he views any violation <br />on his part as grounds for corporal punishment. I wasn\'t mad, and <br />explained to him that what he said was not nice, and he shouldn\'t use <br />that word or speak to his friends that way. He knows right from wrong, <br />but controlling those impulses is another story...<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Karen - Connor, 15, Asperger\'s, ADD & LD & Raymie, 8, NT</div>'
'<P>Hi Barb,</P> <P>Sounds like some similar things to what Im going through right now myself. My son is also in kindergarten and in a ctt class regular ed. My son like Roman is not acting well at all. He has been hitting , throwing things, screaming etc. I think if Im lucky he has 1 good day a week. Even that day is not so great there is some issue like not sitting but not that awful.</P> <P>What kind of class was Roman in for Pre-K? Do you think he can handle the work that they are giving him in the classroom? and at that quicker pace? Also how is his speech? My son seems to handle the work when Im one on one with him but at school going from task to task has been hard for him. Also my son\'s speech is the worst in the class everyone can communicate much better than he can so that doesnt help. Im like you and they have had a behaviorist come in 2 x now. With different recommendations so far nothing has worked.</P> <P>I dont know what an fba or a bip are.... Anyway keep us updated with what is going on. Im in the same situation and very stressed!!!</P> <P>Sharmyn</P>'

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">1.We brush at every diaper change - so approx every 2/3 hours. Though in truth it\'s usually closer to 3... shhhhhh.... don\'t tell the OT!   2. We do therapeutic listening once in the am for 30 min. once in the pm for 3o minutes. (just started this)   3. Aidan wears a weighted vest for a half hour before ABA sessions.   4. swinging - during each (or when there is time before each) ABA session (just under 10 minutes each time) and after dinner   5. jumping - tramp is out for spontaneous use - I usually encourage him to jump before sessions or any other time where concentration/focus is expected.   6. tactile - We incorporate tactile activities into ABA - examples - we taught colors with fingerpainting/ colored sand - when working on drawing - circles, crosses we used shaving cream - rice bin/water table for in/out - empty/full - playdough-we do lots of turn taking but really we can incorporate anything with playdough.   7. deep pressure throughout the day - squishing in pilllows, squeezing. We have done ABA sessions (when we felt like he was really needing input) - in the couch. One time when we were doing yes/no we put him in the couch and asked him if he wanted more pillows. We could have run that all day and he would have been delighted.   8. Spinning - spin in his chair during ABA and sometimes they pick him up and spin him as a reinforcer. In total I would guess he gets about 20 minutes or so total daily spinning time.   8. Heavy work once am, once afternoon, once before bed. Usually I give him things to carry up the stairs or have him push/pull wagons full of heavy stuff.   9. Before bedtime we drag him up and down the carpeted hallway while wrapped up in a blanket. </div>    Outside of our \'world\', wouldn\'t this sound like some kind of Taliban torture method (especially 3, 8 and 9)?</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #400080\">Bill</span> <span style=\"color: #FF8000\">Aly 16;Dillan 14;Jason 11 Liv 8 ASD Grace 6 PDD</span> <span style=\"color: #FF0000\">and Linda</span></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Bill</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Ok, so lately I\'m on here venting about every other day. i guess I\'m just going through a rough time.     My latest challenge to is find NT kids to come over and spend about an hour at our house during ABA so Joey can have some good peer models in his sessions and work on social skills.  I asked one of the moms at school and she gave me about 10 different reasons why she didn\'t want her daughter to participate, the main reason being that she is just so shy and she didn\'t feel she would do well . ..I mean, maybe I\'m just oversensitive to all of this, but this is a very normal 5 year old with great manners, great speech, and all we want is for her to come over and model for Joey. This mom just irritated me to no end - and this was as she was picking her up from a play date at another child\'s home which she said was ok because  \"she knows\" this little girl well and is comfortable with her. She is in class with Joey 3 days a week and knows him too!     I guess I feel I\'m teetering between wanting to understand and believe this mom and feeling like  she\'s just blowing us off because she doesn\'t want her daughter at our home involved in helping with this or with my son because he is autistic.  I guess it\'s too much to expect of people, but it just sort of stinks that they can\'t be more understanding. These are all stay at home moms with the time to do it.     A couple of other moms have been willing, so I will ask them, but this one just left me with a huge headache. This is all so emotionally hard, and hard to wonder if people truly are being discriminatory or not.  Maybe I am internalizing things and taking people\'s comments the wrong way. I don\'t know. I feel as if I need counseling for all of this myself.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Joey, 6 yrs., PDD-NOS  GFCF, Yasko, RDI  Did ABA for 14 mos.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Joey, 6 yrs., PDD-NOS  GFCF, Yasko, RDI  Did ABA for 14 mos.</div>'
