'jonsdfca -What size class did your son have in preschool? If his preschool IEP requires a smaller class size, they have to explain (in writing if you request) why they have upped his class size. In term of benefit to him, not in terms of whether or not they have an appropriate class in the school. They must FIND an appropriate class if putting him in the kindergarten with the all the kids is not \"reasonably calculated\" to enable him to make \"more than trivial progress.\" This is what the law says. If you believe he will not progress at all in his proposed placement, you can go to Due Process and make a case that the District is setting him up to fail. Read your Due Process Rights - the school MUST give every parent at copy at least once a year.'

I haven\'t really settled down much mostly because I need the fresh start over and over.

One of the bands I played with (of which my brother was also a member as a drummer) did do fairly well locally, playing gigs on and off for about 2 years. We broke up when our frontman decided to go solo, essentially ditching us in the process. <br /> <br />I do get taken advantage of and misunderstood a lot on the job, and that\'s one reason why I have never kept any one job more than about 2 years. This school-teaching experience that I\'m dealing with right now has been absolutely horrendous for me from all aspects, and I have been in almost continuous overload for the past 3 months. My separate lives in my hometown (where my family lives), and my college town (where I have some close friends), serve as escapes for me on weekends and scheduled breaks. I will leave teaching behind in less than a week, and focus solely on my other 2 \"lives.\" I will seek to find employment and stability in one place, while using the other as an escape and a crutch. I\'m not yet sure which town will fill which role, though. After I\'ve had a few weeks to recover emotionally, I will proceed to figure that one out.<span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by stickboy26 on May 25 2007 at 9:21am</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>-   ~Nick   Still in touch with my inner child ;)</div>'

'Niki, <br />My son is in Kindergarten and he will turn 6 on Sunday. He is not the <br />oldest one in that class by the way. He is only in a half day Kindergarten <br />and believe me he has been in an intense ABA program for some time. <br />He still is getting used to the demands that are placed upon him at <br />school. He has to process everyting so much faster. Its pretty fast paced. <br />I have noticed a lot more inattentiveness and zoning out. We are <br />tweaking his home program a bit to get him used to the pace of school <br />and all the distractions that it entails. Without the supports that my son <br />gets, I think he too would be a mess.

He will attend the regular classroom for circle time, recess, and specials (art, music, gym, etc) and this class will be his \"homeroom\". He will spend the rest of the time in the autism classroom. Our school district does not use ABA in the classroom. Instead, the autism classroom uses a system based on the TEACCH method. While we love the ABA work we have done at home, and we know that our son has made great progress because of ABA, he does seem to have developed some issues of prompt dependence as a result. After meeting with the teacher and staff, we are excited about the methods used in this classroom, since they will work on helping him learn more self-initiative and independence.

She thought he was just missing rest time. When I pointed this out, she talked to the teacher and we came up with a different solution, which I hope works. I don\'t want him missing academics and his teacher totally agreed. My goal is to keep him in the mainstream classroom for as long as he can handle. I want the resource room to be a safe place he can go if he needs a short break, but I want him to graduate with a diploma if possible! </P> <P>I know I\'m sounding anal - especially since ds is in kindergarten. But, I don\'t want to start out with him being pulled out more than necessary. The ASD teacher agreed and is in full support of him staying in the classroom for almost all of the day. He needs a couple of short breaks and needs to finish his lunch during the class\' rest time - that is it for now. We will adjust as academics get harder and the pressures increase.

'I would request an IEE. What other tests were administered? Any tests for Autism or aspergers? What did the behavior rating scales look like?'
'Schools are not just responsible for academic progress but also for behavioral and FUNCTIONAL progress. If your child has organizational skills issues or social skills issues, he needs an IEP for that. Get the school to give him academic testing EVERY year. If he is not behind now, he will be by 4th grade (when kids are asked to work completely independently) if he doesn\'t get help NOW. Go back to that Advocate and get further advice. Or get a better Advocate.'

During school, they have informed us that his awareness of peers is sufficient for him to learn his ABC\'s (or whatever), which is their main responsibilty.

'<P>Gilda - </P> <P>You might want to make your situation a topic of its own, so it gets the attention it deserves.</P> <P>Micki -</P> <P>My answer below is a little rambling, sorry, but here are my thoughts about structure.</P> <P>I recently had a meeting with the school, and the new vice principal seemed shocked that my oldest son didn\'t have a visual schedule. She wanted to see that happen, and I wasn\'t exactly going to say stop, since the meeting was about the school planning and preparing for his day better. Too much time was being wasted on cozy activities or just plain drawing because there was no sub for his assistant/spec. ed teacher and no plan for him independently using the computer. In order to have a daily plan for HIM to see, they have to do the planning work for THEMSELVES.</P> <P>Anyhow, the first attempt at a visual schedule in 1st or 2nd grade was a failure. It just overwhelmed him to think too far ahead. We\'ll see how it goes now, but for him, it seems like routines work best. He says he hates special days because of the kids shouting hurrah (!) but then again he enjoyed the Christmas assembly more than getting candy at school that day. I see he can tolerate a greater sensory load than he used to, and I think that affects his need for structure and predictability. He can approach these situations with more confidence than fear.</P> <P>He\'s pretty flexible in terms of working with different people (like subs). But doing different kinds of worksheets is tougher. He gets easily overwhelmed by new worksheet tasks, especially if they have a mix of demands. So one kind of structure that\'s really important for him is focusing on one learning goal at a time. In math, we focus on math concepts and not his handwriting, for example.</P> <P>Structure that provides built-in cues is also good because it helps him stay on track with a task. I can\'t really think of any examples right now, but gtto\'s how to boil water video came to mind. And tape on the rug to mark where the child sits (and stays seated) in circle time, things like that. </P> <P>We don\'t have a lot of structure at home, and he does absolutely fine with that.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Norway Mom (mother of 2 sons who were born in 1998 and 2001.

'<P>If this is the annual review meeting, it will start with Present Levels of Performance. What infomation do you already have about his behavior? Is that enough to gauge his current level of behavior? If not, a FBA may be necessary to understand fully his present level of performance. The purpose of an FBA, as you may already know, is to find the FUNCTION of the behavior. The function is vital to know in order to come up with an appropriate behavior plan. When you get the FBA - before or after the meeting - depends on what you want to do with the info. I wouldn\'t postpone the meeting to do the FBA. I\'d have the meeting and table it if it becomes clear that the FBA information is vital in order to write the IEP for next year. You can always agree to whatever CAN be decided and then meet again once the FBA and resulting BIP are prepared. If knowing the function of the behavior is central to deciding placement for next year, then it might be important to get that done first.</P>'

'<P>Karbie - I was the president of our school district\'s SPec. Ed. PTO for 6 years. We have about 2,000 kids in our district who are classified into the spec. ed. system. Any given month, I\'d have 6 to 8 parents attend the meeting. It was VERY discouraging, especially since they were the parents who were the MOST knowlegable and needed the help the least. What I HAVE noticed, though, is the parent of autistic kids seem FAR more involved than the parents of kids with other disabilities. That may be because autism has, until recently, been enough of an unknown disorder that even the teachers were sorely uninformed, so the parents HAD to get involved heavily. It may be possible that the two autistic children you are getting will have similarly involved parents. I hope so.</P> <P>If you know a little about these students (age, functioning level, verbal level, etc.), perhaps some of us can post resources we have that might help you a bit. Of course, this is an excellent site - better than any other autism site I\'ve been on.</P>'

'My daughter found it very hard to jon in floor time. she couldn\'t stand having every one so close to her. She used to sit on a chair just outside the circle with her Aide so she could still see and hear what was happening and join in. Also they had puzzles, and beads(her favourite toys) to play with while they did floortime. My son (also autistic) had his own special mat to sit on - a holden car mat because he loves holdens) and this helped him to stay seated on the floor with everyone else. Be sure to ask the parent what the childs interests are. Liz<div class=\'post_sig\'>- onlinedizzy  2 kids on the Spectrum make life twice as nice</div>'
'We delayed kindergarten for my son who has a June birthday. I enrolled him in our local Head Start program which he went to 4 days a week for almost 4 hours a day and then 3 days a week in ECSE. He also got PT, OT and did gymnastics to help him catch up on many things. We also did a few social skills groups outside of Head Start (which did tons of social skills stuff with all of the kids).<br><br>Our dev ped said that if you are going to hold your child out from kindy - list the reasons why. And then address them all that year that you hold them out. Otherwise, it wasn\'t a good idea. Note that the child doesn\'t need to attain all the goals that you may have listed - but that hopefully they have made progress.<br><br>We have not regretted holding him out. He is in 2nd grade now and his gross motor skills are getting more on par with the kids in his class. We did intensive PT that year we held him and it helped SO much! He learned how to ride a bike without training wheels and use moon shoes and a pogo stick - and all sorts of stuff that kids do. He enjoys playing basketball and football as well.<br><br>Academically, he is doing well. Socially, he has three really good friends and everyone tells me that he is well-liked. When I go to school to volunteer, the kids all talk to him and don\'t look at him strange (well, unless he\'s having an off day and is acting strange). They generally seem happy to see him whenever we see someone from his class.<br><br>Now, this is our experience and every child/family situation is different. You have to decide what is best for you. <br><br>Some districts won\'t let you hold a child out for a year and still provide special ed services. In MN, they let us do that - which we are very thankful for. I\'m not as concerned about the transition years at the end (maybe I\'m naive or just overly optimistic) - but if that is a concern for you, that is definitely something to consider. <br><br>Most people that have held their kids don\'t regret it, but a lot who didn\'t hold their kids do. Research is mixed on the effects. I think not holding can affect a child the first few years - but most research says they eventually catch up. That is with typical kids, so it\'s hard to say for kids with autism.<br><br>My son has always gotten along better with kids who were a year or two younger than him, so this was a good mix for him. He has a lot of social interest, so it helped to have kids around who he was more interested in playing with (younger ones). He got lots more practice with social skills that way, as opposed to being with kids who were mostly older than him (since he has a summer birthday) who might choose to ignore him - which was the case in our old town.<br><br>Again, it is a very personal decision. It\'s hard to know what one is best - but sometimes it helps to hear various perspectives!<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS (9 yo) diagnosed with mild PDD-NOS and DD (6 yo) NT - but definitely a challenge!</div>'

'Calm down. Find out first if you can get him an IEP. Then some of the issues can be addressed through the IEP. Also, since management of his behavior is something that appears to be his greatest school challenge, keeping him at home will not help him learn to manage in a group. Academic progress is the least important predictor of life success. Getting along with others is. Behaving in a way that is welcomed in society is. Think about that.'

'Tzoya, think of it this way, if they have interupted his instruction time, then there is a way of making it up to him.... It could be tutoring him in an area that he is behind on. I myself know of the many battles we have at hand, but they have cheated us and our children of the same amnt. of time as other students and that is something -that is not acceptable! The state is held accountable and they receive funding and we pay our taxes. We have every right to bring it to there attention and now its the\'re choice on doing the right and legal thing. Also, to let you know, it is illegal to have them on the buses for long periods or long commutes. I\'m finding this my way of now probably getting what my son needs in other areas also. I have been fighting for other services and now I\'ve got them at the horns.

'<P>Hi Tammy,</P> <P>My first question is, who administered the ADOS? You probably have the name on paper, but the question really is, is that person a school psychologist, or an autism specialist? A school psychologist is fine, provided that person has experience working with people who have ASD. The results of the ADOS are somewhat subjective, because they depend on the observations of one person (the person who adminstered the test, who can consult with the person who videotaped it). </P> <P>I am sorry, I don\'t know your history, being so new here. But, if the ADOS does not reveal a \"qualifying\" score for ASD, other factors still need to be considered such as observations, and informal tools to examine social understanding, pragmatic language (many of the standardized pragmatic language tests do not reveal the pragmatic language problems in high functioning ASD) and non verbal language.</P> <P>So, a couple of thoughts, if the results of the ADOS feel dramatically wrong to you, perhaps request to have an autism specialist evaluate the videotape and provide an additional set of scores ( if needed), make sure you ask to look at the test protocol (which is the actual score sheet the observer used), or ask that the other measures (2 observations on 2 different days) be looked at more closely.</P> <P>That\'s all I can think of at the moment. </P> <P>Good LUCK! I hope your meeting goes very well.</P>'

'<P>Unless there are out-of-state private schools that are on your \"state approved list\" for special ed placement, the IEP Team does not have the authroity to send your child to a private school. However, you can get them to pay for it anyway, under certain circumstances. An imparital hearing would be required for this. It\'s called a \"Carter case,\" after Shannon Carter, a Florida girl whose parents successfully sued the SD for her tuition at a private placement not approved by the state. Now, it\'s possible for parents to use this precedent to do the same thing. However, the expense, up front, is enormous. And you have to prove 2 things to a hearing officer (or judge if it eventually goes to court). #1 that your child is not being provided FAPE in his current placement (that is unlikely if things are now going well for your son and things remain that way) and #2 that the school YOU have placed him in IS providing FAPE. Yes, you have to place him in the residential school yourself, pay the tuition up front, pay the lawyer up front and wait for reimbursement should the hearing/court case go your way. The cases in my current practicum are almost ALL Carter Cases. It costs parents from $30,000 to over $100,000 UP FRONT. Then, they end up getting reimbursed eventually if they win.</P> <P>Sorry. I don\'t think this was the answer you were hoping for. I\'m really, really glad your son\'s current placement is working. I wouldn\'t worry about the ED designation of the other students. Many probably are Asperger\'s anyway. There\'s a lot of misdiagnosis of that around. Also, many of the ED disorders have symptoms not unlike what our ASD kids go through. As long as your son is placed so that his emotional life is good and he is making progress, that\'s what counts. </P>'
'I have no experience with this, but just opened the post out of curiosity.<br><br>Funny story - my son is completely non-verbal, but his receptive language is 100%. He started a new school in Sept. When we went to \"check in\" on him after week 1, an Aide comes up to us and says \"xmxmnvjfh?\" We smiled, what? She looked puzzled and said \"English is second language in your home, right?\" We said no. She said she assumed since our last name is Russian - that was ds primary language.(yes, it is a crazy free for all at that school - another story). She told us she had been speaking Russian to him all week and he understood her! Of course, we didn\'t believe it. She demonstrated \"sldkdodj\" to ds, and he got up and got crayons. \"ldkdkdod\" he went and packed his bookbag. We were in shock.<br><br>Very, very weird - she did not physically prompt him, but I guess he just got used to her instructions.<br><br>Anyway, maybe ASD kids do have a greater capacity to pick up other languages?<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to Anthony (11-ASD, non-verbal)& Michelle (8-NT)</div>'
'Geez - I almost wish I lived in the US. Where I am (BC, Canada), the <br />school district doesn\'t provide <u><strong>any</strong></u> summer services. <br /> <br />We\'ll be signing Donny up for \"Summer Fun\" again this summer, a joint <br />day camp run by the local YMCA and the local Community Living Services. <br />It\'s for kids ages 5-12, NT, or special needs. The kids are divided into <br />three groups, by age, with two Y counsellors to run programs and care for <br />the NT kids in each group, and CLS staff assisting Y staff, and supporting <br />the kids with special needs. Generally, the CLS staff will have 1-3 <br />children to care for each, in addition to helping out with the group as a <br />whole. <br /> <br />It\'s a lot of fun, they play games, go on trips, etc. The cost is $10/day (8 <br />am - 4 pm), and you pack your kid a lunch. The program is in high <br />demand, with way more special needs kids than CLS staff, so you typically <br />don\'t get many days. For instance, this past summer, Donny got all of 6 <br />days <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"> <br /> <br />If I worked, we\'d be in a whole lot of trouble - the local daycares don\'t <br />have the resources to care for a child with autism. The best you can do is <br />the YMCA day care (which during school year is \"after-school program\", <br />and during summer is \"Summer Fun\"), but even during the school year, <br />even if you provide your own staff for your child, you\'re lucky if they can <br />get your kid in for 2 afternoons per week. People in our town with kids <br />with special needs either don\'t work, or have a trusted friend or relative to <br />care for the child. <br /> <br />Our school district doesn\'t <em>really</em> provide ST/PT/OT, even during the <br />school year. They <em>say</em> they do, but it\'s a total cop out: You can ask <br />that your child receive services, and what will happen is the district\'s <br />therapist will \"assess\" your child, and put forth some very, VERY basic <br />recommendations - like maybe half a dozen minor goals. To get this <br />\"assessment\", there\'s usually about a year to a year and a half wait. The <br />therapist doesn\'t actually DO any therapy with your child - it\'s up to the <br />TAs to implement the therapy. The TAs don\'t have the experience or <br />time. Donny was seen by the district speech therapist in Grade 1, and <br />has been wait-listed to see her again ever since. He\'s seen the OT/PT <br />person twice, once in Kindergarten, and once this year, for observation. <br /> <br />Further, if you provide your OWN PT/OT/ST, like most of the parents in <br />BC do, they cannot go into the school. Further, the school can only follow <br />the plan you\'ve paid for privately, if it is first signed off by the district\'s <br />relevant therapist. <br /> <br />It\'s totally ridiculous. <br /> <br />As a result, Donny\'s only official therapy, even during the school year, is 1 <br />hour per month of combined PT/OT. We did pay for 12 hours of ST this <br />past year, to get assessments and a plan put together. We do everything <br />else ourselves. <br /> <br />Right now, I\'m trying to hire a student to do 10 hours of ABA per week, <br />under my direction, and can\'t even find anyone. To use one of the local <br />ABA companies, I\'d be paying WAY more - $175/hr for consultants, who <br />must see him at least 10 hours per month, plus their billing for <br />coordinating the program, and then pay for the therapy itself on top of <br />that. <br /> <br />Ugh - now I\'m going to go and feel sorry for myself <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley7.gif\" border=\"0\"> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Donny 13 - classic autism, bipolar</div>'

'<P>I have requested to meet with the school pyschologist prior to the testing which will start next week.</P> <P>Here is a little background.. my son is 8yr and dx with autism. Last time he was tested was in March 2006. Most of his testing came back well below average aside from reading which is scored WAY above average. Overall is IQ came back as a 69 which but him within range for MR. Needless to say this was very shocking to us and upsetting.

I feel this is a REALLY sensitive area for me.<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"></P> <P>- If you notice he is having a \"off\" day and extremely not paying attention will you continue testing him or reschedule?</P> <P> </P> <P>I think that sums it up.

'<P>hi all, I only joined the forum today. I am a special education and have been working with children with autism for over 10 years now. I noticed on the forum there are lots of questions etc I may be able to help out with, so thought I would join. I also see a lot of my past students at home and do some one on one tutoring, offer support and advice regarding a range of issues, in particular behaviour support and set up intervention programs. I also do some consultancy to schools and kindys as an independent advocate. At this stage I am doing this a \'favours\' outside of my fulltime teaching role. however, I am hoping to grow my little passion for this area into a mobile service and thought I would just put it out there to gain some idea of people\'s insteres in something like this service. </P> <P>sarah </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- sarahweb</div>'
'<P>Hi everyone!</P> <P>My DS is nearly 4, and we don\'t have an official DX yet. The pediatrician felt he was pdd-nos, and referred us to a developmental behavioral pediatrician. We are currently on the waiting list to be seen. I didn\'t want to wait months to get him some help, so in May i had him evaluated by the school district. The psychologist felt he just had some developmental delays, and would be fine after some therapies. She would eval. him again in the fall and we would officially qualify for services. Over the summer, we did 12 wks of social skills therapy, and began speech therapy this August. I have watched my little boy come out of his shell this summer! He\'s done amazing! 2 weeks ago, he was re-evaluated by the psychologist at the special ed preschool in our school district. She was amazed w/his progress. She said they where really on the fence about whether or not he needs services, but decided to recommend him. Our case conference is 10/2, and at that point everything will become official, and he will have an IEP. My concern is, my DS has some sensory issues. I have a nagging feeling that they will not write OT into his IEP, and he really, really needs it. I can\'t get him OT at the therapy center we attend w/o a DX, and it could be a few more months before we get one/if we get one. </P> <P>Can anyone tell me what my options are w/the school system IF they don\'t write OT into his IEP? I am willing to fight them tooth and nail for it, if I have to.</P> <P>I\'m not sure we exactly belong on an autism forum, but I didn\'t know where else to go for advice on this sort of an issue.</P> <P>tia.</P>'
'Yea, I can call an IEP meeting when I want, was just hoping they wouldnt make it so hard. I put it in writing at his last school, so I\'m not above doing that. And with him being in the back, his teacher couldnt really say why he was, I\'m guessing she didnt take his learning issues into consideration when making the seating chart, which is why I want a meeting so they truly understand him. This particular school has gotten alot better over the years, but when my husband went there, the kids with learning issues tended to be pushed through etc. Well that sooo will not happen with my child, and when I seen his seat in the back, thats how I felt. Little do they know, they cannot pull a quick one with me lol..Thx for the input though, good to hear sometimes I\'m not being crazy! :)<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Kimberly    Son Kameron 9 PDD-NOS, Mixed receptive/expressive language disorder  Kaitlyn 5 NT</div>'

'<P>Jean </P> <P>From what I am reading in my statesboard of education Special education rules is that either you or the school can ask for a due process hearing.

'<P><FONT size=3>Hi everyone. I have a 6yr old son Adam. He has Asperger. We just found out about 7 mo ago. His kindergarten teacher was wonderful. She understood and took some training for autism, went through the whole process with us. Adam is now in first grade and has a new teacher. I don\'t think she has had any training in autism. I recieved a note last friday and was asked how to stop him from stimming. He sings, clicks and hums a lot. He has been injured 3 times so far this year from other students, the teacher says she can\'t do anything about it because she hasn\'t seen it happen. Adam won\'t tell because he was told to worry about himself and not what others are doing, we all know how they love rules. I also found out yesterday that his teacher walked up and gave him an \"angry look\", but never said anything. I asked Adam what he was doing at the time and he of course didn\'t know. I also found out that he has some new students in his class and one has threatened to beat him up and another has started calling him names. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=3>I would go to the old teacher for her advice on the new, but she has left to open a new school.

'I recently pulled my 5yo dd out of her mainstream K class and put her in self contained. We tried letting her get used to the mainstream during the summer pre-k program (lots of problems) and even after school started it was just too much for her even with supports, sensory area, little walks to calm her,everything we could think of. She was just too stimulated all of the time, her aide was well meaning but untrained so basically useless. Meltdowns constantly and too many other kids to deal with so she was just allowed to go on the computer all day. Now she\'s very happy to be in a class where they \"get her\". I just wish I had done it from the beginning. My dd is very advanced academically but if they can\'t ever settle down to do their work what\'s the point? For us mainstreaming was a huge waste of time.'

'<P>It\'s hard to give a wholey constructive opinion not knowing your daughter and her needs, nor knowing the school system. My basic philosophy is to support inclusion as much as possible. It is in this setting where she will receive instruction at a pace aligned with children her same age, and she will also have social models her own age. If inclusion can\'t meet all needs (with accommodations/modifications), then supplement with special education addressing the specific instructional needs. If needs are very intensive, then replace with specialized instruction. Based on your description and my philosophy, I would consider placing your daughter in a regular education class with supplementary, targeted special education instruction. </P>'
'<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=1>Hi everyone- My name is Julie and I\'m brand new here. I\'ve spent the last day or so reading through many posts and think you ladies (and guys) are very insightful. I apologize in advance because I know this is going to be a rather lengthy post. I really hope a few of you at least will take the time to read it and respond... I\'m feeling pretty alone in my struggle at the moment if the truth be told.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=1>My son is eight, 3rd grade, dx with PDD-NOS, ADHD and an Anxiety Disorder when he was five. He is in a Life Skills Class (only option other than general ed. class). Cognitively he is fairly high functioning; socially/behaviorally he is similar to what you would expect of a NT four year old.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>Having him in the Life Skills Class has always proven to be a bit of a struggle when it comes to getting him academic work that is at his level. He reads at grade level and is probably at about a beginning 2nd grade level for math and writing. Most of the other kids in the class don\'t function that close to their grade level, so most activities are geared to their abilities more than his. However, I\'ve always felt that for the time being, this was a more appropriate placement than a general ed. class would be for him in part because of his social/behavior issues.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>We started the process of reviewing his IEP on Tuesday and I think I really rocked the boat. The subject of his reading level came up and the teacher said that they have no curriculum at his level in the room. So, I asked why he couldn\'t get whatever the general ed. 3rd graders are reading and do that. The 3rd grade teacher he is assigned to said she would be willing to provide, the Life Skills teacher didn\'t seem too pleased with the idea. We weren\'t able to work through the entire IEP in the meeting, so we have another one scheduled.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>The school has asked to reevaluate him and unofficially I have been told that if he does well enough on the evaluations they intend to force him to go to his neighborhood school (there was never any discussion of a major change of placement at the meeting). The school he is in now was our neighborhood school until we moved in May. The neighborhood school has NO Life Skills, NO Resource Room. They would put him in a general ed. class for the full day with an aide for part of the day. They say that behavior and social skills deficits are not a reason to keep him in Life Skills if he is academically at grade level. They appear to be totally ignoring his Anxiety Disorder and the issues associated with it. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>I just can\'t wrap my brain around a full day in general ed being an appropriate placement. Just for starters, large groups of children really agitate him to the point he can\'t function and yes he gets what is being taught in a specialized setting, but I don\'t believe he would really get it in a general setting. Also, his attention span is so short; last year one of his goals was to be able to sit for a 20 minute math lesson/activity period, by the end of the year he had worked up to ten minutes.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>I have even greater fears on the social perspective. It took him 2 1/2 years in that class to really began interacting with the kids. Now for the first time, he ackowledges a couple of them as friends (his only friends). Plus, he is having issues with self esteem right now, thinking he is a loser, calling himself a jerk, etc. Add to that the fact that in the last few months we have moved and his dad left for an extended military deployment and I\'m afraid that one more major change would be just too much for him. He is still somewhat traumatized over moving and having serious attachment issues since his dad left. I always thought I would be shouting from the rooftops with excitement the day they told me they believed he was ready for a general ed class; but sadly I feel that this is not the proper time and they are just trying to get me out of their hair. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>I would be supportive of a plan that had him remaining in that school, spending part of the day in his current Life Skills class and part of the day in the general ed. class. Then, possibly considering the move to the new school perhaps next year.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>I\'m reading everything I can get my hands on, but it seems that most of the info is about how to get children into inclusive classrooms... not much on keeping them in a Life Skills or self contained class. I really am kind of at a loss as to where to go from here or how to effectively fight them on it. I am looking for an advocate in the area.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>I really appreciate you taking the time to read my ramblings... sorry it went on for so long.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1></FONT> </P> <P><FONT size=1>Julie</FONT></P> <P> </P>'
'<P>I was so glad to find this site. I often feel totally alone out here, educating children with significant disabilities in a small town. When I came here, they were 20 years behind in Special Education. Now, 18 years later, we\'re maybe 10 years behind but we\'ve started to backwards in the last few years. Anyway, the nagging questions I have about BIPs are:</P> <P>1. What do you do when the behavior communicates \" I don\'t want anything to do with anything you want me to do!\"?</P> <P>2. What do you do when you can\'t find any powerful reinforcers that you have control over?</P> <P>I would like to know more about relaxation routines but the student I\'m most concerned about doesn\'t really exhibit his behaviors under stress. I just can\'t get through to him. He doesn\'t care about anything in our world. I struggle to find educational goals that will mean something to him. I also have a concern about stims. For years, I\'ve just felt stims served a purpose and the kids would abandon them once I taught them something else to do but every once in awhile I run across a kid whose stim is so pervasive you can\'t get through to them or their stim is so socially unacceptable that I need to reduce it before I have time to teach something else.

She knows about 40 words from the 100 word list they say a first grader should know and she\'s in the second grade.</P> <P>I would like to know if there is <strong>one</strong> program anyone would recommend that would help us out. Unfortunately I\'m no rocket scientist and I need lesson plans laid out for me. So, it could be a computer program or a book but I need something to get this girl going that\'s interesting. She does love to look at photos and I\'m busy doing some flash cards with words that feature her and family members, pets, local businesses. etc. I did see a book online that had sample lesson plans...<strong>The Reading Lesson: Teach your child to read in 20 easy lessons</strong></P> <P>Has anyone tried that one?</P> <P>I do modify the school\'s work....let her type spelling words, I type answers to things she circles them...etc. Just looking for something inspirational here in the reading dept. if anyone can help.</P> <P>Thanks,</P> <P>Cara</P>'

'<P>It\'s only the potty training thing everyhting else is going pretty well. I had a meeting and was about to have another with the school but they got an aide but it\'s for every child in the class. This is a typical school my daughter is almost 5 yrs and it is Pre-k. Since they got an aide i sent in a chart to tell me when my daughter is dry/wet and how frequently my daughter is taken to the potty. </P> <P>So the family worker comes out telling me shes confused and so is the aide that the aide is for the other kids too. So who the heck is gonna take my daughter more frequently?!!! Also the school has another aide in the class as well to help out what the heck is their problem. So i had a meeting to get an aide for other kids that mostly all are potty trained and they can\'t take my daughter more to the potty or track it? I\'m angry because we were gonna have a meeting and i should be making the potty goals more specific. If i want to ask for a new \"Norap\" (hopefully i spelled that right) do we need to have a meeting? The stupid teacher that takes care of the IEP is nowhere and she isnt taking my calls now everyone claims she isnt there. Why should i be working hard at home to get my daughter trained but yet at school they wait 2 hrs and then take her with the rest of the class, shes having leaks and all in her pull-up. The PCA was taken out of her IEP now i have to fight to get it back in and the school wont budge trying to tell me i will need to fight for it again once she goes to kindergarten.

'I think it is very hard for teachers to give our kids everything they need. They have over 20 other students in the class and ours is not the only one with special needs. All children have needs and they need to spend their time proportionally for all kids. This is why mainstreaming can be so difficult. <br>I know that one year I had a child who was mentally ill and he consumed so much energy and time that I worried constantly that the other kids did not learn or get as much attention as they deserved. <br>I think that as a teacher and a mom of a child with autism it is important to make sure that the teacher has enough of support and education. Special educators could help by covering the classroom so the classroom teacher could spend quality time with student with special needs.<br> In my experience it is the aide who ends up teaching our kids and this takes away from classroom teachers control and relationships. Most teachers are doing a great job. We just need to be aware of the limitations.<br>Cecelia<br>Mom to Emily,9, and Nick, 7<br>'

'<P>A one on one is hard to come by especially in a budget crisis. Like others said, I\'d stress flight risk and safety risk. I am not sure what your district has to offer but this might lead the district to come back and say that if your dd is such high risk that she will need to be in a self-contained class. My ds is in mainstream with a 1:1. He is not really a flight or safety risk though he on occasion has had his moments. He has great language, is socially engaged, high IQ-just really \'different\' from mainstream peers. This year the district had to slash their budget and even though my son has been doing well they recommend a more restrictive program. I know it is mostly about saving 1:1 funds but of course they can\'t say that because an IEP is supposed to be about needs not funding. Still I don\'t even blame them: the extra for a full time EA has to be about 20,000 and of course they rather have him take the empty spot in a more restrictive setting.</P> <P>As far as what do you want in an EA - my school did not let me have input and as far as I heard their only criteria was someone who has a history of rarely calling in sick because EAs don\'t get substitutes. If they let you have input I\'d look for someone with a very developed theory of mind, meaning someone who is not rigid herself but can understand where your dd is coming from.

'<FONT size=1>I\'m in Wisconsin and lived in Illinois, but, if this is a mainstream classrom, 25 kids is standard. I put my son in Special Ed-he is in a small class with an aide, and gets so much attention. His academic and life skills have really taken off. They sort of stagnated in mainstream school. Special Ed doesn\'t mean \"low IQ.\" The kids can work up to their ability, even if they\'re gifted, but they don\'t have 24 other kids distracting them, and they get help when they need it, both behaviorally and academically. If you\'re talking about a Special Ed class that\'s HUGE. I\'d still give it a shot. They may hire more aides or you can fight to get your child her own aide (we got a 2-1 aide for Lucas, yes, it was a battle). Although my son spends at least 40% of his time in a \"typical\" envoronment, I have read and my own experiences lead me to believe that ASD kids don\'t mimic \"typical\" behavior, no matter how much they are exposed to it. I think my son became socially acceptable by all the learning about it (role playing, social skills class, text book social skills teaching) in special ed. I think, and its\' just my opinion, that there is a big misconception that ASD kids \"pick up\" how to interact socially when they watch \"typical\" kids. I don\'t think they pay all that much attention to them and can be harmed being in mainstream all day because they aren\'t accepted by the other kids, and my son used to be very sad that he never got invited to birthdays or that nobody wanted him on their team. In SE he has friends and even made some \"typical\" friends-not a lot, but a few. I wouldn\'t homeschool an ASD kid. There are no serivices at home and, imho, it just isolates the kids more than ever. For our kids, I believe getting out in the world is just as much, and even more important, than their academics. I wish you luck...I truly think you will see an overall improvement in how your child relates to large enviroments and stimuli as she gets older. Our precious ASD kids tend tend to improve with the right intervetions. Unlike some disorders that get worse, ASD kids improve! And that\'s great! <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"></FONT> <span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by pammar on August 11 2006 at 4:48am</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Pam from WI</div>'

'<P><FONT size=2>I agree with Tzoya that having a para for the reason of staying on task is not the answer to that problem. This teacher and class aid need to step up and keep him on task. IT\'S THEIR JOB!!!! And it makes me so mad to hear that she is sending work home saying he was off task for as much as 10-20 mins without being redirceted. I have a feeling that if her administrators knew this, she\'d be in hot water. Especially with the special ed administration, as she is about to cost the system more money and your child his access to a free and APPROPRITATE education. When really all she has to do is keep your son on task and then the work can get done. Now that she has told you he\'s off task all that time, your next question to her should be how are you redirecting him. If this much work is coming home undone, she better have some dang good documentation somewhere of what was tried before she sent it home. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>You need to meet with the IEP team and ask that question. You need to see what he can do when he is redirected by the adults in his class rather than a one on one aide. All of the children at my school right now with one on one paras DON\'T need them and it makes me so upset to see how dependent they are on that adult. They can\'t do ANYTHING without the lead of someone else. Not even go to the bathroom or p.e. alone. Mainly I think that is because the para feels responsible and if something were to happen when she wasn\'t around, she feels she\'d be held liable. This comes from untrained and nontrained aides, which is common. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>I just can\'t stress enough that your son needs to be given best practices of redirecting and positive behavioral supports for being off task before his independent, appropriate access to the general education system is taken away. I know you say he is young and might be missing critical skills because he is off task, but this is also the prime time for him to learn to become dependent on an aid. If i were you, I\'d be holding the teacher\'s feet to the fire on this one. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>Call an IEP meeting and address your concerns about so much work coming home and him staying off task for so long. Have accommodations put into the IEP so that he is able to only do some of the work. If he can do the first half it correctly, he isn\'t missing anything by not doing the second half. It\'s not the quantity of work we are looking for, it\'s the quality. Teacher\'s just need to know if a child can do a skill or not, not know that they can do it 50 times. Ask specifically to know what the teacher and class aid are doing during all that time that he is off task. The fact that \"you wish\" you could make them accommodate is not acceptable, nor is it acceptable for the teacher to say she has 20 other students and can\'t take that much time to redirect your son. IT\'S HER JOB!!!! And only you can fight her to make her do it. I promise you the administrators would rather make her do her job instead of spend money to get an aid. And your son is going to benefit so much more from her doing her job.</FONT></P>'
'<P>My son is getting intensive intervention in reading during school which he gets pulled out for. Hes getting 2 hours and 45 minutes a day of reading pullouts. He has been sounding out sounds all day long (literally all day long!) so hes made huge progress there because he didnt know his sounds at all. </P> <P>As far as identifying his alphabets when you point and ask him which is which he can only name a few which are H, S, O and X. They are basicaly the same alphabets he knew a year ago. His teacher mentioned to me last week that hes really struggling with identifying them but hes doing great on learning his sounds. </P> <P>I think its strange because when hes writing his name hel write H then pause and not know what to write next once in awhile and il have to tell him \"A comes next\" and he write it! </P> <P>Anyway is there any type of learning approach taht we can use for him that will help him? Someone mentioned aba based learning but im not exactly sure how they teach that way. And his problem seems to be memory based i think.</P> <P>The other day he came home from school melting down and saying that he cant remember his \'memories\'and went on to cry that he wanted everything to be the same (he does this fromtime to time) like furniture back the way it was, walls the color they were. He also was crying that his memories he cant remember his memories over again. I asked him if he had trouble in school and he said yes. His teacher told me a couple weeks ago that hes having trouble remember what he supposed to do if she explains whatthe kids need to do hel just sit there but the other day he came up to her and said \"I just dont know what to do!\" I feel bad for him :( </P> <P>Anyway, any advice would be appreciated!

'Thank for the replies. I went again today for two hours and they had <br />things a bit more organized. I am not sure he is learning much but I do <br />like his teacher and he is fine with being there. But I have to say just <br />sitting in and observing has been giving me a lot of food for thought <br />about what kind of program I want for my kid. I saw another kid (about 6 <br />and scrawny) who had a hard time adjusting to the different school & <br />teacher and got very restless and agitated and hitting (not hard-more <br />flailing about) and they kept bringing him into a padded quiet room. I <br />have to say that it seems to me that systems tend to err on the side of <br />caution and if there are restrictive measures in place they will use them. I <br />know that a padded quiet room is not in-itself an evil place and does <br />provide security for the kid but at the same time I think there could be <br />better ways in which the kid could calm himself and for the staff learn <br />how to read him. A quiet room is just too convenient and provides little <br />opportunity for a teachable moment. (And I speak from the experience of <br />having worked on psychiatric units with quiet rooms.) <br />Maybe just seing my kid in a place like that still gets to me. It was like the <br />first time I heard myself saying \"my son is seeing his psychiatrist this <br />morning\" and it echoed in my head. It just sounded soo wrong - not what <br />childhood should be like.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- micki, mom to three wonderful and wild kids.  ds 10 asperger & anxiety  twin dds 6 quirky but NT this far</div>'
'<P>momdadtojake - Very important part to mention! That definitely changes my thoughts, then. I was mentioning that there are other things out there that help a child, and ABA doesn\'t necessarily need to be written into a goal or skill. However, if you are doing a full ABA program and it has been successful with your child, and he would potentially lose these services after having received them for six months, it would probably be important to get ABA actually written into the IEP. This would be your grounds for sending him to an out of district placement. What state are you in? I can check into whether the district in your state is allowed to tell you \"no specific methodology\" or not. </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>-   \"We should not strive to change the child with autism to fit the learning environment; rather we need to change the learning environment to fit the learning characteristics of the child.\" (TEACCH)</div>'

'The truth is the Govt. starting this year is making disability eligibilty scores higher so less kids can qualify for services and to take alternative state Tests. Another words less kids will qualify for Se is the goal. This was on the radio where I live in Tx. Isn\'t that loosing the child rights under disability law. Govt. wants less in Se.

'<P>I\'m not at home right now, so I don\'t know if a pm would be sent to another computer, but I haven\'t gotten one here. I\'ll check tomorrow when I get home.</P> <P>Believe me, the home school has LOTS of power. The \"providers,\" be they individual service providers, private schools approved of by the home district, county run schools or schools within other districts, ALL want to get paid. And they get paid HANDSOMELY by the home school, so the home school has plenty of leverage. Every situation is different in terms of the agreements, of course, but I believe out-of-district schools sign contracts that agree to implement the IEP to the letter. If the school is a private school paid for by the PARENTS, though, that is very different. However, if it\'s an approved private school paid for by the District and it\'s the placement of record on the child\'s IEP, the District has PLENTY of power, since it holds the purse strings. It\'s imperative that there be ONE entity with authority and power. Otherwise, no school could ever be pinned down. So, the home district is the one with the responsibility and the authority. If the parents have trouble in an out-of-district placement, they need to go to the administrators in the HOME DISTRICT and tell them, preferably in writing, that the child\'s IEP is not being implemented. The home district is paying PLENTY for the IEP to be implemented and they will be the ones in trouble if it ISN\'T implemented, so they have a vested interest in seeing that the other district does the job it has agreed to do. Of course, the out-of-district school can say, at the outset, that they are limited in what they can provide, but then the home school needs to find another way to provide that service. If there isn\'t ONE entity that is ultimately responsible, then no one will ever be responsible. </P>'

'<P>tzoya, </P> <P>to answer your question... NO </P> <P>The way this school appoints paras is to observe the child the first two weeks of the school year. And than the pricipal will decide where the paras will be placed. So the IEP states this. ( somthing like .. suppport staff will be in place at the start of the year, and evaluate the need). So I know he will have a para for SOME of the time, but I think a full time para would be the best. </P> <P>So we have an IEP meeting after school starts. </P> <P>I will check out the links horanimals posted. </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to Matthew almost 9 yrs old (AS) and Jason 5 yr old (NT)</div>'

'<P>OMG - NEVER give a school district access to your child\'s medical records or ANY records outside of school! Rescind that permission asap. Then ASK, specifically, what records they want to see and decide for yourself if you want to give those records, in writing to them. ALL records should come through YOU. </P> <P>Neuropsychological evaluations are not something permanent. They are about where the child is functioning at the moment. YEs, they can say they believe the child is autistic and often DO say that. This is an educational diagnosis from an educator (albeit a VERY INFORMED educator) and may or may not stand up in a hearing, should it come to that. Many place DO accept the opinion of a NEuropsychologist, though, however the other testing he does (speech, reading, math, IQ) is only valid for a short while - like 3 years. If your District is looking for a MEDICAL diagnosis, go to an IEP meeting and ask them to pay for an IEE of your child at the doctor of your choice. Of course, since they will pay for it, they will have access to it. ALternatively, you can find the \"go-to\" doctor in your area who gives medical diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorders and get a dx through your insurance or on your own dime that WOULD stand up in a hearing because it came from a doctor.</P> <P>The school district can certainly perform the ADOS, with your permission, though. If it comes back saying that your child is NOT on the spectrum, ask for an IEE and get them to pay for one from a practitioner of your choice.</P>'
'It is true we all have a lot of rights. And we all should be AWARE of our and our child\'s rights. However, sometimes it\'s important to consider sending a child to a different school, even a far away school. Sometimes it\'s more important to keep our children in their neighborhoods. It all depends on the school, the family and, most importantly, the individual child\'s NEEDS. These children are OUR children, not the school\'s. They can have every IEP meeting they want, but they CAN\'T make a parent do what that parent thinks is WRONG for that child. At least no without a big legal wrangle. When we go to IEP meetings, there are people in that room who are experts in psychology, in education, in OT, in PT, in speech, in autism. But not a one of them is as much an expert in YOUR CHILD as YOU are. Of course it\'s vital that we seek their advice and make informed decisions on their advice, but in the end, the IEP Committee does not fully determine what will happen to your child - YOU do.'
'<P>Mamabear,</P> <P> The actual teacher your dd gets is really important. Did you check on their personality and teaching styles? I would inquire and make a request for who I think would be a better fit. My older kids had this teacher in kindy who had a personality that pulled kids out, involved them and was involved with each and every child in her class the best way. My kids had different personalities and different levels of maturity, she just had it and was the best, my more quiet and shy child was as involved with her and the classmates as well as my more outgoing child. So maybe you will be fortunate to find such a gem, if you find her she will let you know if more needs to be done by involving an aide. </P> <P> I know of one situation where the child had adhd and the mother was the class mom for 2 years.

She began to tell me that one of the older boys in the AI room is becoming more aggressive and is hitting the other kids in class. Alex was hit yesterday. She wanted to let me know what was happening and subtly inferred that I should call the school principal and/or special ed dept to complain.

'Well, I talked to an Advocate from the state of Ohio and learned some new info that made me even more angry with my school district. My son is in 2ng grade now, and in kind. and 1st we had IAT meetings every 3 months, and I thought this was normal for one. Every meeting however we had the same results, same problems and keep doing the same thing basically. I FInally got an MFE done from the school psychol. and academically they said his scores didnt qualify him for special services. Although they new he needed extra help with all of his work because he doesnt \"get it\" on his own. I just got his DX of PDD-NOS, Mixed receptive/expressive language, borderline intell. functioning this month, and they dont care to take it into account!! They basically just repeat things to him to help and that is the extent of it. They took it upon themselves to put him into a smaller reading and math class-title, but say he doesnt qualify for title! They wont put it in writing that he NEEDS title, or give me an IEP, when he cannot do work on his own typically. Plus he gets a little anxiety and every now and then doesnt want to go to school etc. <br />Well to sum up the advocate told me they obviously know he needs extra help because we had the IAT meetings for 2 years, but did not do anything major to help him. And since THEY put him into smaller groups, even though they wont say he Needs title classes, they really know he does. And they havent even taken into account on his school eval my New Dx so that changes things also...Just soo frustrated that the school gave me the run around going on 3 years now and they should have been doing more, adn i thought that, but finally made the proper choice in calling and ADvocate to help me better understand my sons rights..Well tomorrow I am drawing up the papers to serve to the school from the advocate, and will make them do something finally with her on my side!! They will not let my son fall through the cracks because they do not want the extra paperwork and time he needs! He is already going to be 8 in Feb. and its been a long fight, poor kid should have had more help before, but I couldnt even get his Dx from someone until this month!

'Thank you for your replies. Her IEP states 2x week individual therapy and 1x a week group. Her articulation is at less than 1% ranking amongst her peers. She has the articulation patterns of an 18 month old according to the tests, so her speech needs are pretty critical. She is not getting what she needs in group because group is three other children and listening to them talk they speak so much better than her. Maybe its some peer modeling situation but I doubt it knowing how my school district works. Its just a way to \"give\" children their services in a very cost effective manner. <br><br>I\'m upset about the day change because they initially asked me which days would work for Annabelle and I told them Mon, Tues, and Thurs and I told them why. That is what we agreed on and then they changed it in December without consulting me and now they are telling me that there is no other time to fit her in so they will have to drop that day a week. I look at the goals on her IEP and I don\'t think she has met even the goals she had for last year, so its not like she can afford to drop that day of the week. Her private therapy is important because it makes up the additional hour Annabelle needs that the school couldn\'t accomodate originally (last year) and they focus more on day to day speech. <br><br>The developmental ped we saw in Sept said that the district did the bare minimum testing regarding Annabelle\'s speech. He and the evaluators at the second eval we had done picked up on Annabelle\'s expressive language disorder and the district did not. So, all the school district does is focus on articulation and not expressive language, our private therapist does both.<br><br>I am just so tired of fighting these people. I am not an assertive person by nature and this really puts me outside of my comfort zone. Just attending an IEP meeting is way outside my comfort zone, fighting the district is well out of it. I know that I need to do what is best for my daughter but I am not sure if fighting is the best. I really already feel that my daughter isn\'t really getting any services at all from the school but they are just having her there to assuage me. It seems like both of the school pathologist don\'t like my daughter or me. <img src=\"smileys/smiley18.gif\" border=\"0\"> It almost feels like the more I fight the less she really will get in the end.

'<P>This is some really bad stuff. The special ed administrators in your district should know what is and what is not acceptable. It is their responsibility to take the safety factors into account. I am going to reiterate my opinion that in many cases the administrators (the ones who actually have the power to do something) do not realize the crap that students with disabilities are subjected to by others in the district (i.e. transportation folks and principals). Usually they are the last ones to know the particulars regarding any transgression. By the time they find out parents are usually irate and the administrator know has to go back and try to fix the mess that was created by others. This creates a whole other dilemma as the special ed administrator then has to figure out how to fix the situation without stepping on toes. At the same time they have to educate the transportation person who was operating from their frame of reference as opposed to the child\'s and parents frame of reference.Many times it is a training issue and these events serve as opportunities to train those who do not have a good grasp of the needs of student\'s with autism. Finally, this is all conveluted by the fact that special ed administrators are still district employees who need to have one foot in the rotten culture of exclusion that still permeates many districts throughout the country. They have to maintain the image of being team players while also fighting the negative vestiges of a system that was never created to work with those students who present differences (we are still part of a system that has shown little propensity to change - bureaucracies are very slow to change and schools represent the last vestiges of the industrial revolution). </P> <P>I work with a great many people who do not believe that all kids can learn. They still do not think that all of our kids belong and do not see the value of educating all students in our system. But I digress, the bottom line is that the special ed administrator also has to play the game if they are going to be able to navigate the system and cash in on relationships later. Furthermore, being part of the district team means outwardly supporting that team even if you know and believe that it is screwed up. The ability to change it from within will not come from fighting the sytem but rather knowing the system and manipulating the sytem for the purpose of changing from within. I think that the average special ed administrator lives this every day. The effect is certainly an inefficient system that does not always take into full account the individual differences of all of our students. Administrators are constantly fighting the \"one size fits all\" approach. Parents often times do not see this battle as it is a carefully kept secret that goes on behind closed doors were nobody can see. Principals hate sped administrators because they challange their authority to run their own little kingdom where they are free to make all of the decisions (regardless of whether or not they are legal). The same holds true of transportation folks. Special ed does not jibe with their goal to move as many kids as possible in the shortest amount of time. In my opinion everything needs to be treated as an opportunity to teach and to train. Transportation issues provide me with the opportunity to sit down with the transportation manager and/or the bus driver and discuss the needs of a particular student with autism. It also might present me with the opportunity to provide them with some insight into the students wants, needs and strengths (something that bus drivers rarely have the time to contemplate). In our office we call it \"preaching the good word.\"</P> <P>The biggest mistake that I think special ed administrators make is when they blindly fallow the districts lead believing that their district could do no wrong. The loyalty sometimes acts like blinders to the actual truth of what is going on. That being said, it is sometimes the sheer amount of students, paper work andadministrative responsibility that can serve to have a similar effect (creates blinders). The other mistake that I sometimes see is the inability of administrators to be frank about things. Especially in larger districts the special ed director has little control regarding the day to day happenings in a classroom. Typically the sped director does not even know the teacher in the classroom. Many times the principal hires the teacher and is the one to evaluate him/her regardless of the fact that principal may have very little training in special ed. This is allot like the transportation issue where the sped administrator is the last one to find out when something goes awry. A good administrator when they hear about a possible issue will go and ask questions, investigate the situation thoroughly and will evaluate whether or not the incident did or did not occur. They should not blindly defend their teacher or their program. They should not sweep the issue under the table. Instead, they should hold the situation up to the light so that they can use it as an opportunity to better their service delivery. Most importantly though, they should be honest when a screw up occurs (and they will occur) and work with the parent to make it right even if it means providing compensatory education and/or other expensive interventions. This is called taking responsibility for your actions (i.e. the districts actions where you as a representative bear some of the responsibility). Integrity is a huge part of a well respected and a well rounded district wide special ed program. Furthermore, when your customers know that you are willing to work with them in an honest fashion and that you want to do the right thing then I believe that they are more willing to provide you with some leeway and will also be more likely to excercise patience as you seek to improve upon things.</P> <P>Ok, I can know get off of my soap box.

'To answer your question, both yes and no. Yes we have been funded in <br />the past, but going forward we will have a rough time of it. We were able <br />to secure funding in the past because we started an ABA program before <br />EI or SD had any time to react. Our ABA provider already had a master <br />contract with our EI and SD to provide services. We were able to prove <br />that our son made tremendous progress with ABA. When we transitioned <br />to the SD at age 3, our son was not ready for a preschool program. (our <br />neuropsyche recommended a typical one with a shadow aide) We <br />declined their offer of a school placement and continued on his IEP goals <br />within his ABA program and ABA playgroup. We still get funding from EI <br />for parent training and self help skills (ABA) we also get funding from the <br />SD (ABA) We declined their speech as it was too short and at inconvenient <br />times. We do private instead. <br /> <br />All that being said. You will need an attorney, a very good eval that will <br />stand up in court. May be some expert testimony. You need to have a <br />plan as to what your child needs to be working on etc that they can not <br />do at school. You need to state that ABA teaches your son how to learn <br />from his enviroment. You need to play the behavior card as well. <br />Remember the SD only has to prove that their offer or program have <br />some benefit (not the best) <br />Our goal is to graduate from all services within the next two years. <br /> <br />Sorry to ramble.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to ds age 17/nt   dd age 14/nt   ds age 6/asd</div>'

'This is an interesting thread and unfortunately, I didn\'t read all the posts.. What is do know is the strain my marriage feels since autism has been a part of our lives, which is just over 1 year.. I am married to a wonderful man who is <br />100% on board with our son, autism, this marriage etc. He is truly amazing and weI couldn\'t survive without him. HIs schedule allows him to be home 5 days of the week and he is the primary caretaker to the boys on weekdays, when I <br />work from home (which is what I am supposed to be doing right now!). I only mention all that because even though we have a good marriage and we both are with our boys all the time and he is such a support in all other ways, WE STILL <br />Struggle all the time. The stress of living this life is immense. We often feel like prisoners in our home because going into the community is hard with our son. We often end up doing things alone, or with just one child and they <br />opportunities we do get to ALL get our are usually to a 1. park, 2. a kids place like Gymboree or Jumpin Jakes etc. We NEVER go out to eat, Never go shopping, Never go Apple Picking, or street fairs, or festivals or theme parks etc.. You <br />get the idea- all the things typical families do, we feel robbed of doing. A lot of our typical friends just don\'t get it, making our friendships strained. So, even under pretty good circumstances, we are both angry and sad a lot and the <br />little irritating things we both do that we used to ignore are just the icing on the cake here.

'<P>I haven\'t read all the responses but I wanted to emphasize two things:</P> <P>1. The IEP<strong> <U>TEAM </U></strong>makes all the decisions about your son\'s placement and education, not one administrator. </P> <P>2. The I in IEP means INDIVIDUAL and the law totally supports that. If your son, individually, needs to be mainstreamed but also needs special transportation, that has to be included in his IEP.</P> <P>All that said, I\'d love to know why you want him mainstreamed in 6th grade and what supports you think he\'ll need to transition into a mainstreamed situation in Middle School. MS is a HUGE transition for ALL kids and is particularly difficult for kids with autism of any kind. That\'s not to say that mainstreaming is a wrong choice, but ANY choice for next year HAS to be thought through carefully by anyone on the IEP TEam (and this includes you). Have you seen the Middle School classes you want him in? Can you think of any way in which he will need support in order to \"make it\" in those classes? What are his current issues? How will they be addressed? Of course, they HAVE to put him in the LEast Restrictive Environment in which he can make educational progress. But \"make educational progress\" is the key part of that. Mainstreaming may or may not be the least restrictive environment for your son. Maybe it is. But you\'ll have to make a CASE that it is and the first step toward doing that is to actually SEE the possible mainstream classes and compare them to the next most restrictive environment. MS is VERY challenging for an ASD child just at the moment when the hormones kick in. Anxiety increases, biologically, so you have to factor that in, too. There will have to be a BIG safety net for your son. Mainstreaming might be great for him but not withoug full cooperation from the school and full support written into his IEP.</P>'

'A teacher cant refuse to take a child on the trip if you signed the paper to permit him to go . If you cant go it make no difference on him attending. Now if y ou as his mother think he cant handle it ,dont send him. he is allowed to stay in the school on another classroom while they come back, This is what they do in my son\'s school. There is one kid who is non verbal from what i can see and has behavior issues and he never goes to trips or isbt allowed and i have see another teacher picks him up and takes him to her class until we come back . If y ou want him to go , thats why they have aides and other tehrapists join th trips, to help these kids and they learn in the trips also.

'<P>It\'s not as easy as claiming your rights. You DO have rights to be sure, however, most savvy schools are not going to roll over all that easily when a parent says, \"no\" to their proposed IEP plan. Other school districts have lawyers already on the payroll so many don\'t even flinch when you mention \"due process.\" I\'m not saying to not exercise your rights to due process, I have, but you need to be prepared to be in it for the long haul, emotionally and financially.</P> <P>I work for a school district and I\'m also the parent of 3 boys that are all on the autism spectrum. I\'ve been on both sides of the fence when it comes to IEP\'s and placement. Usually disagreements revolve around cost or control. Nobody is going to SAY that \"cost\" is an issue (i.e., hiring a paraprofessional) but it is a hidden factor sometimes in LRE. Control is another issue: many school staff do not feel that parents \"know\" what\'s best for their child. I\'m NOT saying this is the case, I\'m just saying that\'s the perception and why they can seem so controlling (i.e. not flexible to your suggestions).</P> <P>I think that what everyone has said so far about getting educated on your rights is critical ! You\'ll have these types of issues as the years roll on so it\'s worth the investment to learn what you don\'t know yet about the IEP process. Another option is to find an advocate who will attend the meeting with you. Google \"IEP advocate\" for your geographical area and see what you come up with. </P> <P>Learn what you need to learn. Start creating a paper trail (send and save emails concerning your concerns) and become a good negotiator because finding ways to work with your school rather than against them will probably serve your interests in the long run. Blatant disregard for you, your child, and/or your rights should always be tactfully addressed! However, most IEP lawyers recommend learning to be a smart negotiator.

'<P>Emma\'smom, I hear that laws in California are tricky all the way around. Where I live, special ed teachers are employed by and are representatives of the \"Special School District\", who then places the teachers in the local districts. The local school districts do not hire their own special ed teachers. So, they have a sort of monopoly on the special education corner, unless I can find employment in a private school. (I\'m crossing my fingers for that.) There are a couple of tuition-based private schools in my area that cater to LD kids exclusively, but due my daughter\'s emotional instability those schools are not an option for her. </P> <P>Going off-topic a little: I was worried that it might be impossible to work as a special ed teacher all day long, while being a mom to a special needs kid, and to still somehow maintain sanity. It seems like you\'re still sane &amp; rational. (Congratulations!) Are IEP meetings tough for you as a teacher facing a student\'s parent? How do you handle that?</P>'

'All these replys have been great and helpful -thanks. <br />We did have the IEP meeting with the new school. They are a pretty small <br />operation (what I like) and kept telling me how it will be hard giving my <br />ds the \'extra\' he needs with the few staff they have, but they also said <br />that the IEP was appropriate and they would make it work. <br />I asked if there was a question of them taking him and they said they will <br />talk with the principal and let me know. I asked if as a public school they <br />can refuse him and they said \"That is a good question\". I think part of <br />the problem is that I am dealing with extreme West Coast flakyness. I also <br />pointed at the IEP specifying that ds needs a person at the beginning of <br />the school year to help him transition and ask how that would look like <br />at their school and again was told -with a smile-that \"That is a good <br />question\" <br />After spending last year being told that my ds could not get the help he <br />needs because he had no IEP I am not planning on spending the next <br />year hearing that the IEP is a puzzle to implement. <br />So my plan is to get back to studying Wrightlaw and call frequent IEP <br />meeting until it is understood that I expect them to follow it. <br />Angelstill, thanks for the advice to request every refusal or promise in <br />writing.

'<P>Hi there, I have been reading on this board for almost one year now and have gotten lots of great information. I just did not feel that i had anything to contribute to the board, so I really haven\'t posted up until now.</P> <P>To give you a quick history.... DS was diagnosed with PDD/NOS at age 3. Went to early childhood 3K, remained at this school and was put into an inclusive classroom with support and pullout in 4k, now is 5.75years old and in inclusive 5K with support and pullout at new elementary school.</P> <P>Ds is very bright and smart. He has been getting intensive inhome therapy supplied by the state now for just over two years, he is eligible for three years if he qualifies each year. He has made such progress that he will not even be using up the entire three years. His psychologist says that he is definately Asperger, high function, what ever the heck that means.</P> <P>He is doing great academically, average and above average in most categories, except pretend play and socialization that is, of course. Reading at a second grade level.</P> <P>We had his IEP meeting on Tuesday and we were told in the last 5 minutes of our alloted 1.25 hour meeting that he would not be receiving special ed any longer and would not get a new IEP. My husband told me that he felt that it was coming and so did Ds\'s therapists and psychologist, who were present. But, I did not see it coming, until the last fiveminutes of course. I was wondering how they were going to get the goals and everything else in with out going over. There were two more IEP\'s following oursthat day, it was an IEP marathon for them.</P> <P>I am just numb right now. I am happy and thankful that he is doing so great academically in school, even his behaviours are wonderful. they say. He is not so wonderful at home, behaviorly, which is okay, he\'s go tot let it out somewhere. But, socially, he just is not like the others. I have been told by the teachers that he is well liked and sought out. That he seeks out the other children, but the few times I have been there, I have not seen a whole lot of this. I M affraid of him being left behind the other kids and having anxiety and depression being alone.</P> <P>He goes M-F, fullday on Monday and Friday, until 2:00 T,W, and R. In the afternoons they have a second recess at the end of the day, where they play inside and can do what ever they want. The school says because he has not been there the entire year for the last recess, he is not in the loop of the other kids like he might have been. We just started the fulldays in January. That was brought up at the iEP, that he still is not soming to school every day fulltime. He says he has kids that he sits by and plays with, but he never says that he wants them to come over to play or anything like that. I know, that is a stretch for our kiddos, but that is what I want him to be able to achieve. Be able to WANT and to ASK another child to come over and play.</P> <P>What my concern is that he now goes to a school which is not his home school, because he had to go where they offered the early childhoood kindergarten. So, next year for first grade, he has to go to his home based school, a new school and a new transition for him. He has not transitioned to new schools well to put it mildly in the past. He has had a terrible time starting in the fall, with help from the special ed teachers and aides. What is going to happen next year?</P> <P> </P> <P>We have been promised accomodations by the new prinicipal, who was also at the IEP such as a friendship group, breaks when he needs them and a few other items, which for the life of me I can\'t remember right now. I was just flabbergasted when I realized what was happening. I did make the meeting run over by 20 minutes, because I thought I will be d++++ed if you will unload this bomb on me and my son and then not answer my questions. We did not even get a chance to even make any statements or comments. I think at the very least they should have allowed time for questions that we may have had.</P> <P>Up until now, I have been VERY happy and satisfied with how the system has taken care of my son, albeit we are only in the beginning stages of this maze. There was an autism \"consultant\" at the meeting. She shot my son down the first IEP three years ago when he was qualifying for services to start with. She said that she did not agree with the autism diagnosis. And on Tuesday she said it again. She did admit that he benefited from services that he has gotten but disputed that the psychologist(s) that diagnosed him used the most lienient form of tests to get him qualified for services, kind of like, \"be glad for what you have gotten\". She is not very nice, in my eyes anyhow.</P> <P>So, I hope the new school will stand by their offer of accomodations for DS in fall.</P> <P> </P> <P>Does anyone have any other suggestions on what we should be doing or preparing in the mean time?</P> <P> </P> <P>Also, would you have any suggestions for books for advocacy and knowing the laws of the school systems?</P> <P> </P> <P>This has been a long ramble, and if you are still with me, God bless you.</P> <P> </P> <P>Take care and have a great day</P> <P> </P> <P>Robbin</P>'
'<P>I would absolutely go and observe and see if there are things that can help him at the ISD preschool. You don\'t step in, and honestly I would tell him before he goes that you are there to watch, not to interact. If there are sensory things they could do for him, I would absolutely ask for those. Does he get outside OT for sensory integration?? Schools often won\'t do this, and won\'t take it into consideration either. </P> <P>It is nice to hear that I am not the only one with a child that acts out after being fairly typical/normal at a school day.

'<P>Since Matthew has AS, sensory issues are a part of who he is and it should be easy for you to find documentation in his most recent evaluation of his sensory needs. If you do, highlight it, send a copy to the case manager, and simply ask if a sensory diet can be added as an accommodation in his IEP. The worst they can say is no, and then you ask for an IEP meeting.</P> <P>If the eval report does not document sensory needs, you can ask for staff to do informal observations, or you can request an assessment that includes observations and sensory profile. </P> <P>The important part is, once you get this written into his IEP, it does not matter if they agree or not, they just have to do it.</P> <P>I hear you about schools not always being cooperative.

We got one after getting a lawyer. When we first asked for an IEE the SD said no. The lawyer said that they cannot say no without taking you to due process (court) to prove their evaluation was appropriate. We mentioned this and suddenly the school approved it. Note that the evaluator is your choice, our SD tried to control our evaluator. However, an IEE is not magic, the evaluator still has to find that your son qualfies for special ed, and for services. And then you have to fight for those. Our IEE has been on-going for a year now. But the alternative is nothing.</p><p>My suggestion is to say that you are going to do it and then go ahead. If at all possible pay first and accept that you might not be reimbursed after. Getting the SD out of your evaluator\'s hair is probably worth it. Also get an evaluator that does not need SD clients in the near future.<br></p><p>We suspect that in the end we will have to go to due process.

'I used to work at a place with adults with a dual MI MR diagnosis and <br />from time to time we had to restrain people for safety. We had very <br />frequent and thorough workshops on this - it was heavily regulated. <br />I\'d call your schools resource room or better the districts special ed staff <br />and ask them what their policy and training on restraints is. If your son <br />witnessed something that seems to go against policy you might want to <br />document it. <br />I witnessed a kid at my ds\'s scool being restrained. It is a mainstream <br />school and it was pretty clear to me that the staff had no knowledge and <br />training on how to do this safely (at the time that kid posed a clear <br />danger to others). I did talk to the principal and the resource room about <br />that and they did get an FBA for the kid and training for staff. However a <br />special ed program should have proper training already in place. <br />Unsafe restraints are not just damaging and demeaning to the child and <br />other kids who watch it (not to talk about physically dangerous to anyone <br />involved) but also put the disrict at high risk of getting sued. Hopefully <br />they would want to know so they can offer proper training and <br />documentation for their staff. <br /><div class=\'post_sig\'>- micki, mom to three wonderful and wild kids.  ds 10 asperger & anxiety  twin dds 6 quirky but NT this far</div>'

'My response was based on my belief that you live in New York State. I thought I remembered that you do. In NY, we are a \"dual enrollment\" state and even children who are parentally placed get FAPE through their Districts. If I am mistaken and you do not live in NY, you are correct. The minute you take your child out of the school district, you give up FAPE. In fact, under \"equitable services,\" the school district does not have to give an individual child a single thing - they just have to devote a certain percentage of their special education budget on giving services to kids who are parentally placed and those services can be decided arbitrarily by the district. For example, they can decide to pay for computers for students with IEPs to use in the local Catholic school rather than give a single related service to any individual child. It\'s up to the Distict. Of course, most Districts try to give some individual services but those are limited to the required budget, not your child\'s individual needs. You may have far less of a leg to stand on if you live outiside of NY'

'You ask for a functional behavioral assessment of flapping (or some other behavior). There has to be a goal on his IEP that says something like \"the student will reducing flapping by 50%.\" Then they take a baseline score and they COUNT THE FLAPS. It\'s pretty simple. There should be tons of goals already on his IEP. Has he met them? If not, why not. If not, what are they proposing to do so that he WILL meet them? I would not focus on at-home issues at the moment if you can show that school issues are not improving, either. Also, every parent has the right to ask that parent training be included on the IEP so that you can take the techniques used successfully with him in school and implement them at home. If they are claiming he has none of these behaviors in school (which COULD be correct), they STILL have to provide you with parent training so you can be taught to reduce them at home. There is SO much that our kids have the right to but the only way any one of us is going to know WHAT those rights are is to read the law, go to advocacy workshops (sometimes there are some online), read books about the subject. It\'s really impossible for me or anyone else to type it all out here. Another good resource is the Autism Society of AMerica. There may well be a local chapter near you. Try to get in touch with them. YOu may be able to get good parent advocacy training through them.'

'As the previous poster said, it\'s important to figure out WHAT is causing <br />him to become escalated and upset. (An FBA should be able to determine <br />this). This would help you know how to avoid this situation or to remedy <br />it. <br /> <br />Having a visual of what to do when he\'s becoming upset is a great idea. <br />Another thing might be to have a card on his desk that says \"Break\" or <br />\"Help Please\" or \"Water Fountain\" - something that he can use to non- <br />verbally request a \"time out\" from the situation. Even though he is verbal, <br />he probably loses most of his verbal language during meltdowns, like a <br />lot of kids with autism do. <br /> <br />Something that helps in my classroom is to distract before the escalation <br />gets worse... as in, I will send the child to the restroom, or to go get the <br />stapler for me, or to run and check my mailbox. \"Quick, quick! Hurry and <br />get the stapler.\" Sometimes this works because the child forgets about <br />what they were getting upset about (or I have time to remedy it real quick, <br />such as erase a wrong answer or get the red crayon that was missing). <br /> <br />A \"choice board\" of appropriate things to do is something we also use. <br />Have you ever heard of Green Choices and Red Choices? I use a variation <br />of this in my classroom. Basically, the child or teacher can create a <br />board/page that shows green (good) choices and red (bad) choices in <br />different situations. This can be to varying degrees of reading abilities <br />(visuals - photographs or line drawings up to written or typed words and <br />stick figures). <br /> <br /><a href=\"http://www.redandgreenchoices.com/samplematerials.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Sample <br />s of Red Choices Green Choices</a> <br /> <br />You can also use a little tally mark system, red choices green choices, and <br />earn marks on either side. As the previous poster mentioned, the \"stress\" <br />of earning things can sometimes not work well for kids. Sometimes it can <br />be a good motivator, and if it is used in a way that the child is trying to <br />just do their best and not earn a certain amount in a defined period of <br />time, that helps too. <br /> <br />What about sensory items? Does the child have access to any sensory <br />items? Sometimes a stress ball (fancy that!) can do well in these types of <br />situations because it\'s something to get your anger out on that is not as <br />disruptive or dangerous. Silly putty is also good to have around, not just <br />for meltdowns but just to be squeezing throughout down times in class <br />and getting sensory input. <br /> <br />What about a visual schedule, or visuals to determine what\'s going on? <br />Maybe he is frustrated because he wants something else, or because he <br />doesn\'t know what\'s happening? You can use any array of visuals to help <br />the child know what comes next in his day. First we\'re going to work, <br />then we will go to lunch. Just a thought! <br /> <br />Another thing that I\'ve found is awesome (the power of visuals!!!) is using <br />digital pictures of appropriate behaviors. Showing my students \"Wow! I <br />am SO proud when you do your work like you are doing in THIS PICTURE.\" <br /> <br />or \"Look how quiet the room is! Look how you\'re sitting so nicely in the <br />chair. That makes me happy when you sit like that.\" <br /> <br />Also, remember that I teach elementary school so you may have to modify <br />your language or visuals <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"> <div class=\'post_sig\'>-   \"We should not strive to change the child with autism to fit the learning environment; rather we need to change the learning environment to fit the learning characteristics of the child.\" (TEACCH)</div>'

'<P>Hello everyone. I did a search and came across this board. This is my first post and I\'m hoping that I can have some input on my situation. I\'m the mom of a 12yr old 7th grader. He is autistic and attends a K-8 school in Central, FL. He is a high functioning self-contained classroom. His teacher is wonderful. He had her last year and there were 6 students in his classroom. She had one assistant.</P> <P>This year is horrible. She has 10 students and 2 assistants. She expressed her concerns about the number of students. She said she can\'t spend as much time as she would like to with each student. One of the main concerns is that there is a 5th grade student who is low functioning that has been placed in her classroom. I\'ve observed the classsroom. He is constantly crying and disruptive. I can see that a lot of time is spent with him calming him down. This takes away from the classwork. This contant crying and outburts is also upsetting my son. The noise is a factor. People with autism are senitive to loud noises. Also it is hard for him to concentrate on his schoolwork. This is not a large classroom. </P> <P>My plan of action. I have talked to the school RCS. She agrees with everything. She said the 5th grader was placed there as an administrative add on and she has no control over it. I told her that I was going to talk with the county. She agreed. Monday, I\'m call the county Autistic Program Specialist and the Director of E.S.E. I\'m also going to speak to the Principal. I\'m going to repeat what I\'ve written here. I would welcome any suggestions on how to handle this. </P> <P>Thank you!</P> <P> </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Florida</div>'

'<P>MANDT is an excellent program, I was recertified for years. It focuses on how to de-escalate situations and behaviors and avoid aggression and physical contact. If ALL of the strategies fail and DANGER is present, and physical contact cannot be avoided, MANDT also teaches how to interact physically without force, how to be mentally healthy and calm during the interactions, and how to prevent further injury when someone is aggressive. Without training, people who react to a physical aggression are likely to do more harm by grabbing smaller joints like hands or wrists, pulling on a limb, or pulling away from a hair pull or bite. I think this type of training is very important and I have had many severely aggressive kids and I have had to use everything I learned.</P> <P>I do not believe in anything called exclusionary time out under any circumstances. I have experienced situations where kids need to be separate from the rest of the class for the following reasons: 1. offensive and scary profane language during a meltdown 2. scaring or physically threatening other students 3. to protect the student\'s dignity during a meltdown In those situations, I have a small separate room where I accompany the child together with another staff person (so there are 3 of us in the room). We go there and wait quietly until the meltdown is over. If it helps, we provide calming strategies such as pressure or backrub- but most often the child de escalates somewhat, we praise that effort, and when totally calm, we return to the group. I have seen this type of space work wonders for some kids because I reduce all of the sensory input- it is quiet there, little visual stimulation, and can even be made somewhat dim (not really dark though) if that helps. The reduced sensory input is a big factor in helping calming.</P> <P>Finally the behavior management plan is backwards. It should not be identifying how the consequences get worse and worse (miss breaks, call home) for behaviors. Instead it should identify the strategies used to PREVENT behaviors, and the positive motivators used to encourage desired behaviors: earn a ticket or star every time a desired behavior is observed (frequently but random too) and have trade-ins scheduled throughout the day to \"buy\" snacks or free time with the tickets or stars.</P>'

'We have social challenges in our circumstances. The smaller school setting helps facilitate a more controlled environment of children, families and teachers. The tailoring of teaching to each childs need seems to work so much better. It is a lot of work and effort but our children are worth it! Involvement, monitoring and coaching proper behavior between we the parents and the teacher is so much more effective in a smaller setting (in my opinion and circumstance). Progression has been slow but moving forward year after year. I wish there were a pill but investing in a more focused and customized attention via a school setting sounds like a great long term investment in our kids! Good Luck and God Bless.'
'I suggest asking Tyoza on this one. As far as I am aware if you put in writing that you would like the reports then they have 48 hours to respond and get them to you. If you are being avoided by the teacher I would be calling the district special ed person and asking to have them get the reports and also make a visit to the classroom to observe what\'s happening. I would also suggest just as Pierced did make an unannounced visit to the classroom. Our school district has a statement that they want 24 hour notice. I would just go and not give them notice if you don\'t feel that your child is being treated correctly or that something is wrong. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Courage is being scared to death - and saddling up anyway! -John Wayne    Mom to two beautiful boys with ASD ages six and nine</div>'

'<P>Let me clarify what IDEA 2004 says about parents who \"parentally place\" a child. That means, parents who are placing a child in a private school for which THEY are paying tuition and/or parents who are homeschooling their children (this is considered a type of private school.) </P> <P>State laws vary (my own state, NY, is a \"dual enrollment\" state, for example, so what I\'m about to write does not apply in NY). However, Fed law says that school districts are off the hook for FAPE if the parents ultimately refuse the new IEP once all negotiations are over and have decided to refuse the new IEP by NOT accepting the new placement and removing their child from school at THEIR expense. Of course, the parents THEN have Due Process recourse, but in the meantime, the school is NOT obligated to provide FAPE. The parents have to send a 10 day letter seeking reimbursement for their paid tuition and the school has 10 days to answer that challenge before the parents need to file for Due Process if they want this argument to continue. If they DON\'T file for Due Process (mediation, resolution session, Hearing, etc.), the school IS off the hook for FAPE. However that doesn\'t mean it won\'t pay for something, but that is UP TO THEM. They are REQUIRED to pay for something called \"equitable services\" which means they have to devote a percentage of their sped budget to privately placed kids, in general, but not necessarily to any one child. It\'s up to them. Clearly, the last time you homeschooled your child, they decided to provide him with something. This time they are not. You recourse is formal Due Process, which I assume your advocate will advise you about. Of course, your STATE law can be different, but what I post here is the minimum required by the Feds. </P> <P>Anyone on this forum who takes their child out of public school into some kind of private education (including homeschooling) MUST go to their state ed website to find out the specifics of what that particular STATE says about private placements at parental expense. Each state is different. What I\'ve posted here is from IDEA 2004. Of course, all things are negotiable in any state, but this is what IDEA REQUIRES. No more. When you got a change to your son\'s IEP, that meant that your negotiations hadn\'t yet gotten to the \"take it or leave it\" point. If the negotiations DO get to that point and you decide to \"leave it\" and pull your child, according to IDEA 2004, the school district IS off the hook for FAPE for that year. However, they MUST hold another IEP meeting next year and allow you to accept THAT one.</P> <P>Please print out this post to show to your advocate. If he finds any of this to be incorrect based on IDEA 2004, please post that here. I certainly don\'t mind standing corrected if I\'m wrong. However, this information came directly from the law as well as a confirmation from an Impartial Hearing Officer who teaches the intense advocacy course I just completed. My guess is that your advocate has found something in your state\'s law that is different.</P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by tzoya on May 18 2007 at 5:02am</span>'
'<font size=\"2\">I think both of you have good points. Right now, my son (IMO) will<br>benefit most from having good peer role models. He does learn from<br>being around them. Now, in future, he may have trouble actually<br>learning in a typical environment and may need a SE placement. For<br>preschool there is no learning except language and social skills, and<br>a setting of 3 kids is not the right setting for him. I can supplement<br>his day with a day care with lots of typical kids, but how does that<br>help him? He goes from all free play with 24 kids ( where he actually<br>made two \"friends\" today ) to a class of 2 other kids who don\'t talk <br>much, and I don\'t see how that helps. I wish there could be a play<br>therapist helping him in a typical preschool/day care instead. That <br>would be much more useful. I guess preschoolers are still young <br>enough not to care about the kid with the aide. <br><br>Tzoya, great advice about asking them for a date by which the <br>placement must have some inclusion component, because otherwise<br>they keep telling me that this is a new class and things will take time<br>to set up and so on. <br><br>Thanks<br></font>'

'<P>Actually, if your read the regs it does not say daily speech therapy. It says daily language instruction*. In some cases, the entire class gets specific language instruction from an SLP or someone else with strong language training and that can count. However, if it\'s the whole class, that \"session\" can\'t be for more than 6 kids at once and it has to be at least an hour long. So, if your child is in a 12-1-1, the therapist can\'t work with more than half the class at a time. And since these groups have to contain kids with similar needs in order to be appropriate, it\'s the rare situation in which the \"therapy\" can simply be class time. Just wanted to give people a heads up about this \"loophole.\" The other thing is that just because our kids CAN get so much speech it doesn\'t mean that, on an individual basis, they all NEED this much speech or can even benefit. Sometimes, for kids whose actual speech is OK but who need lots of pragmatics, it\'s better to consider a group social skills session with a psychologist or social worker as part of what constitutes their language instruction. All of this has to be individualized to the child. </P> <P> </P> <P><strong><EM>*(4) Instructional services shall be provided to meet the individual language needs of a student with autism for a minimum of 30 minutes daily in groups not to exceed two, or 60 minutes daily in groups not to exceed six.</EM></strong></P>'

'The use of a Rifton chair by this teacher is inexcusable. I have spent a lot of years researching and teaching behavioral management in children with autism, and my biggest issue is how restrictive devices are used to \"contain\" behaviors. The restrictive model is very much like how some people kennel a dog because they are not able to potty train them. So to prevent the behavior, they keep them locked up, but how does that help the dog learn to function within their home?<br><br>Unfortunately, we often take the same approach with these kids. We \"kennel\" them in order to prevent the behaviors that we fear; and so these restrictive strategies are really more self-serving than beneficial to the child. A child\'s progress is based on their ability to adapt. These great kids cannot learn to adapt if they are not able to engage in their environments and be challenged. And so we should not be restricting them, but challenging them (the JUST RIGHT CHALLENGE, of course) to help them learn skills. This way, they can become more adaptive to their surroundings and guess what? Their behaviors diminish, they become more functional, and most importantly, their quality of life skyrockets because greater adaptability is consistent with better processing, less rigid and more abstract play and social interaction, and that opens the window of opportunity to for them to learn skills and become more and more independent. I have worked with older kids and younger adults who have grown up in the restrictive model and besides having fewer resources once they graduate from school, many of their issues persist!<br><br>Now as far as the Rifton chair, it is a good device when used properly to help a child understand boundaries as well as to help him/her with modulation, BUT that is when it is properly used in a therapeutic environment. The use of the chair in this case is simply to help this teacher restrict the child\'s behaviors. The sad truth is a lot of these teachers may mean well, but most of them, as well as therapists, do not have the education to really work through these effectively accept what they think is right because that is what everyone else does. It is time to redefine the educational and therapeutic models so that we can better prepare these kids for the future and NOT just to help everyone survive the day.<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Joel Desotelle, MS OTR/L  Edlantis Seminars, Inc.  www.edlantis.com  Dedicated to the advancement of rehabilitation for children with autism</div>'

I am sorry to sound direct with you, but I experienced the same issues with my daughter. Althrough, I never requested the school district to perform the swallow study test. I went to the nearest feeding clinic or childrens hospital that had therapist that specialized in this area..</P> <P>After doing this, I provided a copy of the swallow study and any other doctor note(s) to the school. They were aware of her feeding issues and the documentation from the doctors on file to back this up. You have to be very careful with the school district and how they use the medical note(s) you provide them. Because, they can put many restrictions and may require a note from the doctor for everything/anything other than listed by the doctor for feeding. So, this causes you to go back and forth with the dr to obtain these notes. </P> <P>Unless you really trust your school district, I would not sign an open medical release of records, this will even cause more issues and they will try to obtain note(s) from the doctors, which will benefit them..And you might not be aware of this, until you sit in the meeting and try to get this fixed...

I think the chance for us with Nina was far higher than 10% but for some people without the family history before their child the chance might be less<br> <span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Allegra on September 03 2007 at 11:20pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>-    Sharlet 7 ASD (mod-sev), Nina 5 Still unknown.</div>'
'<P>I am so lost and I\'m hoping someone here can point me in the right direction. My son is 3 years and 7 months, he was recently diagnosed ASD and just started in a state preschool 3 weeks ago. They have a speech therapist there so I asked her what to do and she told me that she\'d do a speech screening on his...he failed so now she said that she\'ll do a full speech evaluation on him sometime in the next few weeks. She told me that once she has done the full evaluation and knows the results, if he fails she has 60 days to do an IEP. I thought she had 60 days from the day I first requested the initial screening but she said no. I then told her that we were going to request a physco-educational evaluation (even though I\'m not even sure what this is!!) from the school district and that I thought they had 60 days from the day of my receiving my request in writing to do this. I thought that then we\'d be looking at October to do one full IEP for everything. She basically told us not to bother (she knows my son is autistic), she said it\'s best to just do the speech and the speech IEP first.</P> <P>I\'m so confused, I don\'t really even understand what the IEP is anyway or what it would even do for my son. He is doing okay in preschool, I really like his teacher but there is only her and two aides in the room of about 24 children aged between 2 and 5 years old (mixed preschool class). My son Nate has been hitting other children, he has a hard time transitioning, he can\'t stand in line with the other children, he has no interest in circle time and he does not play or interact with the other kids in the class.</P> <P>Help...I\'m lost, I have no idea what we should be doing, what our rights are, or what we should be requesting for our son.</P> <P>Louise</P>'

'In many states, a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">written </span>request to evaluate triggers a time line which they have to meet. If they don\'t, you can file a compliance complaint which might get them to act. But in your case this appears to be water over the dam. If you were to file a complaint all you\'d get (IMHO) is the evaluation and you are getting that.<br><br>IMHO there is nothing you can do to the school district to stop them from trying to do it again. What you can do for your kid is to do everything in writing (create a paper trail) and research the time lines in your state.

'If your child is not of COMPULSORY school age (this varies by state, but it\'s usually around 6), you can simply go to the District and sign him out. Otherwise, you will need a physician to write a letter somehow documenting that your child is too ill to go to school and must be instructed at home. You can also follow your state\'s guidelines for Homeschooling, which vary from state to state. YOU CANNOT SIMPLY TAKE HIM OUT OF SCHOOL. If you do, the District can call Child Protective Servcies and CPS can charge you with Educational Neglect (if your child is between 6 and 16 in most states). Good luck with your new District. <span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by tzoya on April 10 2008 at 3:22am</span>'
'Here\'s what you have to weigh. Yes, schools can be a better place to <br />learn behavior management, but sadly, many fail in this department. It\'s <br />just a fact that some schools are better equipped to serve special <br />education students than other schools are. Some are very progressive, <br />others have no clue. And of course, the same is true for all students. <br />Kids in better economic areas tend to get a higher quality education. Not <br />always, but it\'s mostly true because of the way schools are funded in this <br />country. <br /> <br />What you have to consider is, can I do a better job serving him in all the <br />areas he needs help? For me, the answer was yes, here where I am now. <br />In my dd\'s last school, they had more to offer and were able (and willing) <br />to work with my dd as an individual, and not try to plug her into some <br />program that was convenient to them. She succeeded in that <br />environment. But here, it was another story, she regressed terribly so I <br />decided to homeschool and it\'s been going well. <br /> <br />My advice is to research what is out there. Are there social groups (both <br />special needs and/or homeschool) that he could join. Also, don\'t <br />discount your own ability to facilitate his community outings. Personally, <br />I think schools are among the worse places to learn proper socialization, <br />because a) it\'s seldom facilitated and a lot of bad behavior is learned, <br />and b) it\'s mostly discouraged, unless you have a progressive school that <br />uses group and differentiated learning in its classrooms. <br /> <br />Good luck and feel free to PM me if you want more info. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to beautiful 10-yr old twin girls,1 w/Autism, 1 NT(w/ speech delays to age 5)</div>'

'<P>First of all, if your son needs an aide 3 times a week, he needs one 5 times per week. If he doesn\'t need an aide, he doesn\'t need an aide. I would caution against having a aide if he really doesn\'t need one because kids can become aide dependent and that leads to less independence, not more. ASK them why they think he needs an aide at all and, if so, why only 3 days a week. Sometimes kids get what is known as half an aide. That means there is one adult who aides two kids. But that is 5 days a week.</P> <P>ALWAYS bring all your questions. This cannot be an official IEP meeting if you did not receive a written invitation at least 5 days prior. That is the law. This could be a pre-IEP meeting, meaning that the team is meeting (and parents are members of the team) to iron out questions BEFORE the IEP meeting so that the official meeting can run smoothly. OFtentimes, Districts set aside only certain days during the month for official IEP meetings. On those days, the meeting are scheduled tightly, so it\' better to have a premeeting.</P> <P>Let us know how it goes.</P>'

'<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Dear Lee: How neat to talk (via the internet) to someone clear down in Australia<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley17.gif\" border=\"0\">!I\'m very glad to hear your story and your concerns about your little son Luke. It is not easy raising an autistic child by yourself, but it can be done. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>It is neat you have such good bus service for your little guy. And it is good that he loves his school and is doing great.<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"></FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>I don\'t know anything about Dexamphetamine, but I\'ll try to find out and study its pros and cons. I\'m wondering if it\'s a psychadelic drug like Rytallin, Paxil, Zoloft, etc. Dr. Ann Tracy (a gifted doctor who gives many radio talks and speeches) considers these psychadelic drugs to be very bad (with their side effects and all) for anybody to take, let alone little children.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>In my younger years I worked as a secretary in a mental institution and saw and read the effect drugs had on the patients. The staff would change their drugs on a whim, just to see what it would do to them. It drove them blooming crazy! The only ones that I saw who improved enough and were able to leave were those put in nearby half-way houses and given a semblance of independence, responsibility, and self-worth.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>Your little guy is probably reacting to the reality that he is different and limited in what he can do. I can imagine he has a lot of pent-up anger and frustration-which is understandable. My Mark also went through some hard times when he had to face the reality that \"he was different and limited in what he could do, especially when combined with his inability to communicate his frustrations and understand why he was different. Also, he was probably suffering some real pain-probably as a result of headaches and other damaged areas of his brain and body, and not eating very well. I remember one time (when Mark was about 8 or or 9) the bus driver was honking his horn for me to come out. Mark was out of control and was biting his arms and nearly drawing blood. When I got him inside, I let him know in no uncertain terms that he was never to do that again. That he had to learn to deal with his disability and never get out of control again! So, he never did after that, although when Mark was 10 or 11 or so, and was being difficult and refused to eat his pizza at a restaurant, and he said to me in a very angry voice, \"What did you do to me?\" I stated to him that I believed his vaccination shots he had when he was a baby caused damage to his brain, and that I was too trusting, and that I was very sorry.<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"> He seemed to accept my explanation and over the years appears to have come to terms with his disability. I told him, \"I\'m your friend and I can help you and teach you how to do new things and be there for you, so you\'ll be all right, so don\'t worry!\" </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>I don\'t have any idea what the increased dosage or withdrawal from Dexamphetamine will do to your little guy, Luke. It doesn\'t sound very good that he is having to have an increased dosage. Dr. Tracy says it is very important to reduce their meds a tiny bit at a time until they off them completely. She also states many deaths have been caused by these drugs because it makes them flip out and be out of control and lose their minds, and she has had to testify at their trials about the dangers of these drugs and what they can do.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>So, if it were me, after an extensive investigation of the pitfalls of Dexamphetamine, and if I found it to be deleterious to his health and well being, I would probably slowly take him off this drug and substantially step up his Vitamin C, plus a little calcium and magnesium, and other natural vitamins, and see that he eats plenty of fruits and vegetables, and especially check into foods high in \"B\" vitamins (for his nerves). I\'ve heard Brewers Yeast is high in the \"B\" vitamin group. You are the parent, and you have the upper hand, so don\'t be afraid to discipline him in a positive way in order to get the desired results and save his sanity.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>Sadly, our legislators are trying to limit our ability to obtain vitamins and supplements. So, for our health\'s sake this must be stopped. Something called, \"Codex\". You can find more about this at <A href=\"http://www.healthfreedomusa.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.healthfreedomusa.org</A> and <A href=\"http://www.familyvsstate.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.familyvsstate.org</A>. You can send an email (which they\'re counting and keeping track of) through these websites to Congress and state your concerns about their bill/intent to limit our freedom and abilities to choose for ourselves by severely limiting the amount and kinds of vitamins and supplements that are available. This is that important, and it\'s probably even happening in Australia! Please let me know how you and your little guy are doing.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>P.S., I love your phrases that I\'ve never heard before, like \"out of the box\" and, \"it worked like a treat\". <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley36.gif\" border=\"0\"></FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2> </FONT></P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Best Regards, Marge</div>'

'<P>We sent our son to a mainstream pre-school a few months after he turned 3 (his birthday is in June). At the time, we didn\'t suspect autism. He had a few repetitive behaviors (not obvious ones), some obsessions and didn\'t interact much with peers - although he did some. </P> <P>I am grateful we did. He wasn\'t potty-trained, but others weren\'t either (although they were by the end of the year and my ds wasn\'t). He just wore a pull-up and it was no big deal. He never pooped except at home. </P> <P>If we would have known about his autism, we could have had more supports in the classroom for him - but we were fortunate and the teachers really did everything they knew to do for him. He liked going there and I think it helped him progress socially. One little girl really took to him and they had a love-hate relationship for the whole year - actually, two years since they were in the same class the next year. That relationship alone taught him a lot about interacting with kids. We got to talk about a new thing about friendship every single day!</P> <P>That\'s a tough one. I would prefer to see a child with younger or same-age peers. Older ones are likely to baby him and I\'m not sure what he will get out of learning social interactions from that. Don\'t they have an ECSE program he could attend?</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS (9 yo) diagnosed with mild PDD-NOS and DD (6 yo) NT - but definitely a challenge!</div>'

'beccaposie - Your son DOES qualify for an IEP. Get an advocate. His stimming IS affecting his education. \"Education\" is NOT just grades and passing. It says so in black and white in IDEA 2004. You NEED advocacy help. Even under 504, they MUST to an FBA and BIP if that is what your son needs in order to access an education. If you have not had legal help to get your son the IEP he needs, do so as soon as possible. Every day without the help of an IEP is a school day wasted in this environment.'

'<P>Okay, so Will\'s evals were done.....the letter I sent to the head of SPED and my numerous calls and conversations - plus the documentation and evals that were done and that I had provided for them mad a difference!</P> <P>They have, BEFORE THE IEP (which is TUESDAY) agreed to keep on his current ABA therapist til July 14th (that\'s when the summer program will begin)!</P> <P>I guess, for around here in MA, that\'s UNHEARD of! BUT, I am relentless and I made some valid points.....so at least they listened this far....but I am still going to fight (especially since I got to see what 2 weeks w/o ABA did to him) for ABA to continue along with the summer and regular school program. </P> <P>Can anyone prepare me for the IEP meeting?</P> <P>What should I ask?</P> <P>I went to view the classroom that he would most likely be in and WHOA there are DEFINATELY not enough people in that room to cover Will and his impulsiveness...I\'d be worried that he\'d slip out of the room or get hurt/hurt someone else b/c he got upset and they were too busy. I mean, the ratio wouldn\'t be bad if the classroom was smaller - but it\'s 15 kids max (and it is max by the end of the year for sure) to 1 teacher and 2 para\'s (none of which have ANY ABA training nevermind certifications). It is an integrated classroom so it\'s 1/2 special needs and 1/2 mainstream. It just seemed like, if, on a bad day for kids in the classroom - Will would definately be at a huge risk.</P> <P>There was one kid who was low functioning autistic - he ddin\'t even have a 1:1 - and it was SO sad to see that the teachers TRIED to help him make eye contact and so on - but they had to work with the other kids too - and so, HE suffered b/c of it.....I was sad and angry that there was a HUGE possibility that this child could slip through the cracks - that he wasn\'t given the full opportunity to blossom.</P> <P>It made me want to really work hard to get the proper services for Will - so he didn\'t slip through the cracks....but it also made me realize that maybe my calling in life is to help other families make sure that the services they need are in place......so no child is left behind.....</P> <P>Anyway....enough about my ramblings......</P> <P>Any suggestions?<BR>I made a list of safety concerns.....mostly concerning running away, no sense of danger, choking (due to pouching/stuffing of food), food allergy (severe to milk) and outbursts that are unpredictible.

'My 3rd grade daughter is in a classroom with 32 children this year. 7 of which are \"highly functioning autistic children\". I apologize for not knowing the terminology and am asking for help in understanding the situation. Where I have used quotes I am using the terms used by our principal. <br /> <br />My frustration is that the parents of the \"normal\" kids were not informed of the situation. Until I got home from work and my daughter told us there were some kids that were different in her room, I had no idea. She described how some kids don\'t talk, some shout out, some don\'t move the same as most and I suspected what it was (all the districts autistic children are \"housed\" at our school). Then the phone started ringing. Parents wondering what is going on and what to think about it. Protective loving parent who are scared that their children will be \"shortchanged\" and fall behind. I try to be open minded and decided rather that speculate and join the mob mentality I called the Principal. <br /> <br />I asked him to define the situation which he did. When I said I think the school could have averted a whole lot of frustration and yes, anger from some, if they had let us know ahead of time the situation, he had no response. He did say that the families of the autistic children knew and the school had been working with them over the last year to understand the transition and make sure they felt comfortable and knew the school was there to support them. Why couldn\'t they do the same with the families of the so called \"normal\" kids? I am not opposed to the situation, I just want to understand it. I want to understand what the school is going to do to help the \"normal\" kids understand and adjust to the situation. When I asked, the principal he just said they did it last year and it worked out wonderfully. Great, but what exactly did they do? Define wonderful. I am just as nervous and unsure as the parents of the autistic children in the classroom. <br /> <br />I understand IEPs (my older son was severely speech delayed and we worked with an IEP for 4 years) were prepared for the autistic children, but where is the plan for the \"normal\" children? In my opinion, to make this situation work, both \"sides\" need to have a plan. Otherwise the \"normal\" kids may reject, baby, make fun of the autistic children, resent them etc (and same with the parents). I want my daughter to understand that every person is different, special, and a gift to the world and each other. Every person has gifts and something wonderful, productive, creative, etc. to offer the world. Every person has traits we like and don\'t like and that many of those are out of our control. But I can\'t help feeling like I don\'t know how to address her questions and needs in the situation. <br /> <br />I am sure that many parents of autistic and other \"special needs\" children feel the same frustration. The same helplessness and lack of support. It is so sad that in order to protect privacy we can\'t have open, honest discussions on the topic. Why is it so wrong for the parents of the \"normal\" children to ask, what does this mean to my chid, without feeling like we are being insensitive. It is normal to be concerned and unsettled. <br /> <br />So basically, I am asking for your help understanding the pros and cons, or maybe it isn\'t even pros and cons but rather how are the kids similar and different? What can the autistic children learn from my child and what can my child learn from them? I think this is a wonderful and exciting opportunity for her to expand her horizons and embrace people who are different from her. All I have been able to really say is to basically understand there are differences and to use the tools she has used with any other child and if it doesn\'t work, to see if an adult can help. I told her it is ok to be irritated at times as she would with any other chid. It is ok to not understand the situation and ask the teachers and us for help in understanding. It is ok to like the autistic kids or not as long as it is after she has made an effort to get to know them as she would any other child. I told her there might be some she likes and some she doesn\'t and that is ok too. <br /> <br />I would love to have recommenations on age appropriate books, role playing, websites, anything you have come across that might assist me in understanding and guiding my child this year. <br /> <br />Thank you!'

'My son cannot pay attention unless he is motivated by someone 1:1. So, mainstream preschool is out of question until he learns to pay attention in a group situation. So, I am thinking of doing ABA and special ed preschool initially and once he learns to pay attention better, I am planning to put in main stream preschool part time (3 days a week for 3 days) so that he can generalize and relate to NT environment. I may have a shadow for some time until he can function independently in an NT preschool.'
'<P>I only know the rules in NY. Each state is different, especially if there is a school choice situation. You MUST check with your state. Your child is legally REQUIRED to receive a Free and Appropriate Public Education. If your state allows school choice, it MUST have rules about how to ensure your child\'s FAPE in WHATEVER public placement he\'s in. You might need to check with a lawyer on this if you can\'t get the State Ed Dept. to give you a straight answer. The one thing I KNOW is that, whatever choice you make (as long as it is not a private placement paid by you), your child had the right to all the supports and services he needs to get to access educational benefit (academic, physical, communication/social and behavioral). </P> <P>In some states, it is possible for one public school district to make money from tuition paid by another public school district. I don\'t mean in the sense that a business makes a profit (obviously , a public entity is non-profit) but in the sense that they can pass on more than their out-of pocket cost. HOwever, cross-districting can be very complicated, so many school districts refuse to accept tuition paying students in states that don\'t REQUIRE that they accept out of district students.</P>'

'<P>Mr. B is in a stand-alone special needs pre-school, transitioning to mainstream kindergarten next year. We have a three-ring notebook that goes back/forth to school daily. It\'s divided into three sections - Daily, Parent/Teacher Notes, and Social Stories.</P> <P>Under Daily, I have a form that has pictures of all of the various activities they would be doing in the classroom, as well as a small section for comments and \"Who I played with today\". All the teacher has to do is circle the activities for the day, note who he played the most with, and give me info on toilet training issues. Anything else more indepth we need to address gets put in the Parent/Teacher Notes. It\'s quick, doesn\'t take much time for her to do, and I\'ve found them much more willing to do something like that than spend more time filling (writing) out the various things.</P> <P>The \"Social Stories\" section changes, depending on what we\'re having issues with. I\'ve included social stories using pictures for the teachers to use with him as they need to: \"Circle Time\", \"Use My Words,\" \"Taking Turns,\" \"School Rules\" are the ones there right now, as those are the areas of behavior concerns. It\'s simply another tool for his team to use in a format similar to what is used at home.</P> <P>Because of communication issues in a previous district, I made sure to have it written into the IEP that communication is done daily using the notebook by the teaching staff. In addition, the therapy team has their own that comes home on his intensive therapy day - they just put it in the notebook for me. And, of course, we email regularly, and try to meet informally as a team every 6 weeks or at least right after the report cards come out.</P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by AnamCara on February 02 2009 at 10:10am</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- COPAA Advocate Member,MPact Mentor, single parent to 4 ages 19 to 6, all with disabilities.

'In my experience, a school can be fantastic for one family and a nightmare for another. It has a lot to do with personal dynamics and who\'s on the IEP team, but also depends on the child\'s challenges. The more hidden their challenges are, the tougher it can be to get the school on board.<br><br>My point is that a school (or state\'s) reputation is just one factor to consider.

'<P>The school district is required to evaluate his academic progress. Ask for standardized reading testing, spelling testing, math testing. This will give you his CURRENT levels. That way, you will be able to gauge his progress for next year. Interventions on an IEP are based on Present Levels of Performance, so an accurate score for those areas is important. Once the school test (and IQ test is not necessary and IQ is the least of most kids\' problems), you can ask for an IEE to get a second opinion. Under IDEA 2004, parents can request and get a research-based, peer-reviewed reading program that addresses their child\'s particular issues. So finding OUT what those particular issues are is critical.</P> <P>If your child is having difficulty academically because of behaviors, he still needs a BIP. Pursue than angle, too.</P>'

'Bravo! This is a case that SHOWS how important it is to get EVERYTHING in writing in the IEP. An IEP is a LEGAL contract that the school district MUST fulfill. IF not, they can be cited by the state based on parent complaints. No district wants the state auditing them. You should be VERY proud of yourself. BTW - if they paid more than minimum wage, I bet they COULD get an aide. This is the free market at work. IF they can\'t hire for peanuts, they\'ll have to offer almonds.'
'Everybody at the disability advocacy center is horrified. It has captured the entire office\'s attention, and it\'s one of their main focuses at this time. They\'ve assigned 2 advocates to my son as well as an attorney. I\'m very thankful for that, but let me tell you..... I found out how hard it is to find help in my state. There is literally only one attorney in the state of TN who specializes in education law, and he\'s not in my city. It\'s really tough finding people to help when you\'re in trouble.'
'The Vineland is not for MR issues - it is for ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING issues. It is not an IQ measure - it measures how a child is able to perform in real life, day-to-day skills.

'I really don\'t get this one. What difference does it make to her?<br>You\'d think she\'d be happy that his water is in a spill proof cup.<br><br>Agreeing with above posters - between it being in his IEP and the doctor\'s note, she\'s required to let him have it. Go to the principal, special ed director (not sure what a CSE chair is that someone mentioned so I\'m guessing that is state specific?), superintendent if you have to.

Over the years OTs have also taken on sensory integration therapy. Some are well trained in the sensory part, and some are not. Insurance companies will not pay because they consider sensory integration treatment as \"experimental\". <br /> <br />What complicates things with the schools (and insurance companies) is that Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) is not an officially recognized disability. What usually happens is that a child qualifies for OT because of fine motor delays that affect the child in school. Then the OT will also help with the sensory stuff (but not always). <br /> <br />There are those working to add SPD to the DSM, but it is not currently. <br /> <br />My son no longer qualifies for OT at school because his fine motor is now acceptable. So, he has lost the sensory integation stuff at school (OT pull-out time plus the sensory diet during the school day). He used to have fine motor goals, but never sensory goals. I am sure there are more progressive schools that have actual sensory goals, but this is not the norm. <br /> <br />My daughter still has some fine motor delays and thus still has the OT support. She also has some accomodations in her IEP regarding loud noises (e.g. she sits in the back at assemblies). Maybe this is something you can discuss also. <br /> <br />So, if I were you I would become very familiar with Wrights\' Law (read \"From Emotions to Advocacy\"). This is important whether your child has autism or only SPD. Remember that a child has to have a disability AND it has to affect their education in order to have an IEP. So you will have to show that his sensory needs affect his education. <br /> <br />I would also read some books on sensory integration and start some activities at home. Some good books are \"The Out-of-Sync Child\" and \"Raising a Sensory Smart Child\". These books will help you to also advocate for your child. <br /> <br />Oh, one more thing. Ask the school OT for a Sensory Profile form for you to complete. At least you will have it documented for the IEP meeting, and you can discuss. <br /> <br />Best wishes. <br /> <br />- <br /> <br />mom to 9 year old boy/girl twins (Asperger\'s/PDD-NOS)'

'Your son sounds like my son\'s identical twin when my son was 11. He\'s now 15. I have to say that the years between 11 and 13 were BAD. There is SO much to address in your post that, really, it would be impossible to answer you here. The schools are clearly not giving your sone FAPE, a Free Appropriate Public Education. That is their JOB and they can be FORCED to provide him with what he needs. A huge majority if the ASD kids I know, particularly the higher functioning ones, cannot tolerate the atmosphere of a \"normal\" school. They need to have the same teacher (or only a couple) and that teacher has to be educated in autism. Typically, they need regular academic material but may need to be in a smaller, quieter atmophere to accomplish it. They need help with generalizing what they learn. They need to develop coping skills and organizational skills. Your school district is clearly not teaching your son what HE needs to learn, so they are OUT OF COMPLIANCE. If you post the state you live in, I will post the names of lawyers or advocates in your area. You really area going to NEED the help of someone who knows the law to straighten this mess out. It\'s criminal that our school system changes to the middle school system just as our kids need MORE attention because of the onset of puberty, not less. So please post where you live and I\'ll get you some contacts you can start with. I really, really know what you are going throug because my son went through the same stage. At 15, he\'s doing much, much better.'

'Let\'s go to the talk shows with all this issue. I would love to expose the truth about how Public school is failing our Special kids and the un fair treatment of kids with disabilities. Another big problem I see is politicians who don\'t have answers cause their kids all attend private schools. I also have a issue with hollywood stars and professional athletes who can afford the best experts in medical care while we sit back and have to take what we can get. I also believe it\'s un fair people like that get special help by the courts sytems unlike the real world. Why should those professionals get different stuff then hard working real world people. This shows money does by the best things in life. Sadly all material things can be hear right now and gone latter that day. Life\'s focus should be on helping the people not on just trying to out do other\'s you dislike or don\'t even now. To many people just have to do better than their neightbors.

My name is XXXXXX XXXX (\"Miss XXXXX\") and I will be <br />your child\'s XXXXXXX classroom teacher. I am excited about my first year <br />at the XXXXXX School. After graduating from XXXX XXXXX University, I <br />taught in XXXX for two years. Prior to teaching, I was an active volunteer <br />in an elementary classroom for children with autism. <br /> <br />I recently moved to XXXXX from XXXX. I taught in a moderate/severe self- <br />contained special education classroom in a public school district in <br />XXXXXX. During this time, I was also an in-home trainer for students with <br />autism. I gained extensive experience in this setting. Having the <br />opportunity to share my special education skills with my district <br />colleagues was a wonderful professional experience. While in XXXX, I <br />enjoyed volunteering with the Special Olympics. <br /> <br />My teaching philosophy is that every child brings special qualities to our <br />classroom. My teaching style provides a positive environment for all <br />students to learn through individualized activities specific to student <br />needs. I have a special interest in PECS and Augmentative Communication <br />and am always interested in integrating communication skills into our <br />day. <br /> <br />I also enjoy spending time with my husband, XXXX, and our four-year- <br />old yellow Labrador retriever, XXXXXX. We\'ve recently discovered the XXXX <br />XXXX \"Bark Park.\" We are excited about exploring XXXXX! <br /> <br />While I will try to keep the lines of communication open at all times, I will <br />be able to guarantee a response to parent e-mails and phone calls on <br />Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday afternoons between 2:45-and 3:45. If <br />there is a situation that warrants immediate communication in a special <br />circumstance, I will be in touch with you as necessary. I am looking <br />forward to working with you and your child this upcoming school year. If <br />you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Sincerely, <br /> <br />XXXXX XXXXX <br />XXXX School <br />555-555-5555 <br />xxxxx@school.com <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><div class=\'post_sig\'>-   \"We should not strive to change the child with autism to fit the learning environment; rather we need to change the learning environment to fit the learning characteristics of the child.\" (TEACCH)</div>'

'<P>FIrst of all, if the current special ed consultant is going to continue in that role, I think that a regular schedule of her going to the class is imperative. At this point, she is not supposed to work as a crisis counselor but as a trainer. Have you ever heard of trainings that happen only during crises? How would any of us like it if interns were only supervised by experienced doctors when there was a Code Blue? Training the staff requires regularly meeting with them and asking them to keep logs of what is working and what isn\'t. Ask for regularly scheduled time in the class for the consultant. If she doesn\'t have the time, that is when to ask for someone from the outside to come in since the school cannot meet your son\'s needs with just their on-staff personnel. </P> <P>About the recess situation. I would IMMEDIATELY call for a conference with the Spec. Ed. director and tell that person EXACTLY what happened. Get this resolved IMMEDIATELY. Frankly, I\'d ask for a different para. YOu might need for the consultant teacher to be in the meeting to get a feel from her as to whether this was an isolated incident, or something that may not be isolated but will improve with further training or if this para is not the one for your son. I wouldn\'t actually let it go until the IEP unless necessary. Then I would bring it up there but not be placated unless and until the team could come up with specific steps they plan on taking to get this para better educated.</P>'

'<P>Unless the schools in Florida are completely different than the ones here I am having a hard time believing that the school is offering the \"catering\" you are saying.</P> <P>A lot of parents of special needs children have to fight tooth and nail to get even a few services provided...therefore I can\'t see a school just sitting back and letting the parents run the show when it comes to their child, especially when the behaviors are as bad as you say.</P> <P>No it\'s not ok for this child to be hitting, biting etc. But he is a child with autism and this is a cry for help. He is trying to communicate something and the teachers are failing to understand. They aren\'t there to babysit, they are there to educate. It is a shame that you are saying that the rest of the class is suffering, but I look at it as bad teachers, not bad kid!!</P> <P>Maybe do some research...give them some suggestions...I was just told about something called FBA...someone comes to the school with the sole purpose to figure out what is causing the child to behave the way he is, then offer solutions to fix this problem.</P> <P>I\'m sorry if I am sounding harsh here also, but again this is very close to home for me. The only difference is the teachers in my sons case are trying to fix the problem. They remove him from the room if behaviors begin...they try to calm him and help him. My son is mainstreamed in a public school and they are finding ways to help him I would assume that a class specifically for children with autism would have the means to help him even more. </P> <P>I would stop and analyze the situation a little more before you run to a lawyer. Please take a look at how this school is handling the situation. If an aide might be available to help your child in mainstream classroom, why isn\'t their an aide for this boy to take him out of the classroom when these behaviors are occuring. It could be a million things from sensory to frustration...But by all means, my first thought would NOT be that this child lacks discipline or is just a brat.</P>'
'<P>Hi, my son is currently in Grade 3 in a regular mainstream classroom with help from an Education Assistant half the time.</P> <P>I\'m starting to wonder whether I should be homeschooling him. I think it would be less stressful. I know that he can do the work, but the school environment makes everything more complicated. He struggles socially, he wants friends but is struggling with appropriate play. His ticks are starting to get worse, I don\'t know if it is from the constant demands that school brings. I don\'t know, maybe I am just tired of the whole \"fight\" to make a square peg fit into a round hole. Do you know what I mean? I\'m just so tired of the effort and issues that keep coming up. It just seems so much easier to remove the school from our lives and let him learn at home where he won\'t be constantly judged or stand out as different.</P> <P>Have any of you switched from school to homeschool and how was the transition? Any regrets?</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- mom to cole 8 - pdd nos & jorja 4</div>'
'When we chose our LI school district, I was lucky enough to consult with a professional whose job was to evaluate special ed programs all over New York State. She recommended Half Hollow Hills as a great district. We wound up buying in Harborfields which she also suggested. (We wanted to be a little closer to the water and in a smaller town and school.) But, from what this woman told me, HHH is the gold standard for special ed.

'<br />One thing that the OT should plan is a sensory diet appropriate for your child. Try to get this implemented early on. Would be quick sensory activities (e.g. chair pushups)that would be implemented throughout the day (not just after being overstimulated). The idea is to keep the child regulated throughout the day to be able to handle more sensory input. If there is an an aide, the aide can be trained to implement as per a defined schedule. <br /> <br />Don\'t know anything about medication. However, since we have started biomedical intervention, she seems to be doing better with sounds. She has also had private and school OT for about 5 years, which has helped tremendously. Now she just has school OT. Sounds are still hard for my kids, but due to sensory integration therapy and just their maturing and knowing what to do, things are better. <br /> <br />Headphones /ear plugs have not been the answer for my kids, but are successful for others. Depends on the child. Made my son more sensitive because he would focus on it and listen to every little noise. Each child is different. <br /> <br />Other than pragmatic and social skills, sensory integration has been one of the major issues for my kids. So, I totally understand what you are going through! <br /> <br />Oh, you might also want to try one of the listening programs. Therapeutic Listening can be done at home (as we do), or at school too. <br /> <br />- <br /> <br />mom to 9 year old boy/girl twins (Asperger\'s/PDD_NOS) <br /> <br /> <br />'

'Interesting that you are discussing placement without mentioning goals. My school district does that sort of thing when it has a placement in mind and does not care to discuss goals that cannot be met in the placement in question.<br><br>I believe that the way around it is to get the present level of performance, and then get goals. You might need an outside evaluation for this if the district strong arms the school evaluators into only providing goals that point at its preferred placement. We see that. Then see where the goals can be realistically worked on. After that, you (or your outside evaluator) will need to tour the proposed placements and see how things work at the placements. Remember to ask at the end of the tour if what you saw was typical. I am handled during tours by high level special ed managers, and that puts everyone on their toes, including the teachers. The teachers behave noticeably different when they are under that level of attention.<br><br>All of this will suggest that you are pretending to know something about special education, and are being disrespectful of the experience and wisdom of the special ed staff who can diagnose and find the best placement for your child after a few minute interview and review of records <img src=\"smileys/smiley2.gif\" border=\"0\">. So you are likely to meet with some resistance <img src=\"smileys/smiley18.gif\" border=\"0\"> but it is your right to do so to participate as an equal member of the IEP team. <img src=\"smileys/smiley35.gif\" border=\"0\"><br><br>But to get to your question the \"appropriate\" placement is the \"least restrictive environment\" where the student receives educational benefit selected from a \"continuum of placements\". And if you believe that I\'ll sell you a bridge. From a practical standpoint, I get a couple of choices - if that - and I select the one that does not make me want to throw up. I also ask around and see what other parents are getting to see what is really available. Having a social group of local parents is good for that.<br><br>Best of Luck to you<br><br> <span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Dad2Luke&Alan on May 27 2009 at 9:20am</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it - U Sinclair  We choose to go to the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard - JFK</div>'

'Mamabear, <br /> <br />My suggestion to you would be to request an earlier meeting time for the <br />next meeting. Of course, if they asked for that specific time, it might have <br />been because of various committee members schedules (OT, PT, etc. if <br />they were attending). In my experience, teachers and other service <br />providers do not like when meetings are after school because of the exact <br />reason you listed. We want the parent to feel comfortable asking <br />questions and getting the information they need, but at the same time, <br />some people have been at work since 6:00 or 7:00 AM. <br /> <br />Also, if you\'re ever feeling pressured, or tired, you can ask to table the <br />meeting and continue it at another date and time. <br /> <br />Did the teacher or ARD facilitator give you a copy of your Texas State <br />Procedural Safeguards? (I\'m assuming you\'re in TX because I haven\'t <br />heard of ARD being used in any other state.. correct me if I\'m wrong, <br />though). <br /> <br />I would call up the district or whoever your contact person is and let them <br />know that you are in disagreement with the IEP and you\'d like to call <br />another meeting. In most cases, they have 10 days to do this (from the <br />day you contact them or they receive your letter). This is an excerpt from <br />the procedural safeguards: <br /> <br /><strong>&#9830; Disagreements about the IEP&#151;If you disagree with the school about <br />the IEP, the school must offer to recess the ARD committee meeting for <br />no more than 10 school days. This recess gives you and the school time <br />to gather more information that will help you reach agreement. If you and <br />the school still cannot agree, the school must implement the IEP that it <br />determines appropriate for your child. The school must give you prior <br />written notice that this is what will happen. The reasons for your <br />disagreement must be stated in the IEP. You may write your own <br />statement about the disagreement, if you choose. <br />If you cannot reach agreement, you may request mediation, file a <br />complaint, or ask for a due process hearing.</strong> <br /> <br />You can access the entire Procedural Safeguards by clicking this: <br /><a href=\"http://www.tea.state.tx.us/special.ed/explansaf/\" target=\"_blank\">procedural <br />safeguards, tx</a> <br /> <br /> <br />It is completely okay to have concerns about your child\'s placement. The <br />second ARD meeting that you call will hopefully resolve those concerns or <br />come to an agreement to place her where everyone agrees is best for her. <br />In most cases, school districts DO try to do what they think is best for the <br />child, despite what many people may think. Do not feel sick about it. I <br />honestly think there won\'t be any hurdles to jump and you\'ll likely feel <br />better once you talk to someone who understands what your concerns <br />are. <br /> <br />Good luck.<div class=\'post_sig\'>-   \"We should not strive to change the child with autism to fit the learning environment; rather we need to change the learning environment to fit the learning characteristics of the child.\" (TEACCH)</div>'

'<P>Hi I am new and my daughter (who is 3) was just diagnosed with PDD autism. We just got her assesed from the district and have an app for an IEP next month. </P> <P>The Psyc mentioned that she probably will be going to a preschool type program 5 days a week for 5 hours a day! This is bitter sweet to me because I am happy she is getting intervention, but I don\'t know if this is normal or accessive? I want her to have a lot of therapy but am afriad throwing her into this with 5 days a week will make her shut down.</P> <P>I would even like to do 3 days a week for 5 hours then maybe if she needs more increase it. Does the parents have a say in how many days she goes to preschool or do the professionals have the last say? Someone told me the teachers tell parents they have a say in the IEP\'s, but when it comes down to it we don\'t. Is this true? Will I be able to negotiate how many days she goes to school?</P> <P>Any advice would be helpful for a newie like myself. Thanks.<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"></P>'

'Yes I agree with Tzoya, Does your school have people trained in ASD\'s that do observations to make out a Behavior plan\'s? They wanted to put my child in ED class, at a different school, I asked them if this is where all the ASD children are schooled. It helped put an end to the ED talk. You need to ask for an IEE, in Writing. Also you are not having these problems at home I think that needs to be brought up. Your child is not ED, your child has Autism, there is a difference. I don\'t feel an ED class is appropriate placement for children on the spectrum. By the way Does your child have sensory issues that are being addressed at school? Does he get frequent breaks and rewards for good behavior? My son needed all of these things to function at school, it has made a huge difference. If you decide to do the ED placement, please observe the classroom first, I did and I would have home schooled my child before putting him in ED, in our district. I feel very strongly about this subject, it hits close to home. I also flooded the school with information about Asperger\'s syndrome, they did not like it, or me ,but to bad, cause they needed it. Your child needs an appropriate placement not an easy one. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- mom to 13 year old boy with aspergers</div>'

'If your homeschool has special ed department for the level of services he <br />needs (in other words if his IEP states that he does not require self- <br />contained) they will have to. I don\'t think most school districts would <br />agree to have services provided by outside schools. It is extra cost for <br />them and they will likely first see if the homeschool can swing it <br />somehow. <br /> My ds is mainstreamed and in my experience many general special ed <br />teachers do not really know how to provide social skills for asd kids. They <br />will maybe play candyand and call it something fancy for the paperwork. <br />I\'d say go to the school and ask the special ed teacher what curricilum <br />they are using. <br />If his current school is using something you feel works well ask them to <br />specify it in his IEP. When he is at his new school wait six weeks or so and <br />then ask the special ed teacher to see the data he/she is keeping on his <br />social skills goals. That\'s what I did and that is how I found out that even <br />thouh I kept being reassured that they \'knew what to do\' she had not <br />done a thing. I raised a big stink with the district and they had an asd <br />specialist come in and work on a program with the special ed teacher. It <br />helped the special ed teacher understand what ds needs and how to <br />implement it and my ds is now getting some social skills training. It is <br />still far from perfect but it is something I can build on. <br />all in all the bottom line is : you have to be involved. <br /> <br /><div class=\'post_sig\'>- micki, mom to three wonderful and wild kids.  ds 10 asperger & anxiety  twin dds 6 quirky but NT this far</div>'
'<P>Hi Everyone,</P> <P>My son is 5 and in kindergarten. He was in a 12kid with 2 teacher class that he could not handle at all. I had plenty of posts on here because every day from september -december was a nightmare. In january he started at a new school with 6 kids 1 teacher and 3 para\'s. He did great in febuary and then I dont know what happened. He is very stressful again. I thought maybe because he is not challenged or really learning anything new. The previous school he was at grade level . This class he is in now is to focus on behavior and not academics. He is doing all kinds of terrible behavior again and I just dont know what to think. I would consider medicine but I thought I might wait for the new school in september and classroom and see what happens. I dread getting him from school because they complain to me just about everyday but dont offer any solutions. They put him on a checklist to ease transitions but that cant fix the other issues. His Iep is coming up and I am doubting what classroom setting he should be in. I would like a self contained class at a community school with a para. But of course they might tell me he cant handle the 6 kids ..... I am so sad and confused. Just the thought of another school . It is hard for me too.</P> <P>Sharmyn</P>'
'<P> </P> <P>Loki,</P> <P>he does have an aide at lunch. His IEP is written that he must always be accompanied by an adult, and never be left alone.</P> <P>They normally cut up his food in very small pieces at school, and not give him more until he\'s done. I\'m assuming they were like me, and gave him a slice of apple, and let him eat it himself. It was peeled, since he will choke on the skin. He grabbed an apple slice at home this morning, and did fine.</P> <P>Since part of it\'s sensory I will talk to the OT. Sorry to hear you\'ve made no headway with the same issues, looks like I need to pay more attention.</P> <P> </P>'
'It is not something that CAN\'T be done at the same time as ABA, but if you are using discrete trial, that takes up LOTS of time. Frankly, I think RDI is best for parents to implement.

'<P>The school does not need to see medical information. The team will need to determine that your son has educational needs due to ASD in order to change the \"label\" under which he is currently receiving services, to the new label. That means he will need to meet educational criteria for the new label. A doctor\'s diagnosis does not provide this. However, it can make it a much easier process for the team to do, and it sounds like it should be a fairly simple straightforward process for your son because he has been receiving services already. </P> <P>It sounds like you have already discussed the diagnosis with your son\'s case manager.

'<P>You can certainly call an IEP meeting to discuss immediate issues like this, but the placement is going to have to wait until the testing is in, most likely. I forget what testing you\'re waiting for. Why not keep the IEP meeting appt. and address immediate issues that can be dealt with in the current placement. The truth is, I don\'t think that anything you can do this late in the school year will help your son pass if he\'s not already pretty close to passing.

'I understand your concern with getting services in place - and I am sure <br />the district wants to be certain this will be taken care of as well. However, <br />it\'s Summer! Teachers and other certified staff for public school districts <br />have the Summer off and thank goodness for that! They are able to <br />recharge and get all of their necessary energy and mental power ready for <br />the school year. I guarantee you that you could fight until you get an IEP <br />meeting, but it would not be a very good IEP meeting because they would <br />either have professionals in the room that wouldn\'t have contact with <br />your son, or you\'d have professionals in the room that were required to <br />come into the school on their Summer days off! I would talk to the Special <br />Ed department and see when you\'ll be able to get in touch with the <br />teachers and specialists who will be working with your son, and ask that <br />a meeting be scheduled prior to school starting. If it\'s the week before, <br />it\'s the week before. It IS the responsibility of the school district to <br />uphold his previous IEP unless another one is put in place of it. In our <br />district, if a child comes in and there is a para/aide requirement in the <br />IEP, we hire a substitute para/aide until the position is filled. It\'s really <br />just one signature on a piece of paper from the superintendent and it\'s <br />taken care of until the position fills. Also, a lot of schools have \"floating <br />aides\" that fill in where needed. It\'s possible that they may use this type <br />of person with your child until they figure out what\'s best for him. I would <br />imagine that you\'d want them to know your child, be aware of his needs, <br />etc. and find someone who will fill the shoes of being his 1:1 para in a <br />good way. <br /> <br />Continue to advocate for your son and know that the school district <br />probably does not want a lawsuit and WILL meet the needs of your son. <br />Also, keep a paper trail showing that you\'ve requested IEP meetings, told <br />them about the aide, etc. I\'d even write a letter (if you haven\'t already) <br />stating that you\'d like an IEP meeting as soon as the teaching staff and <br />support staff are available (when they begin school) and that you want <br />them to be sure to be aware of the fact that your child\'s IEP states that he <br />needs a 1:1 aide. This way, if something DOES happen and things are not <br />in place for school starting in August, you DO have a case AND a paper <br />trail to back it up.

'Structured teaching and structured education are terms that are often <br />used to describe autism classrooms, or programs specifically for <br />students with pervasive development disorders. I don\'t think it\'s <br />replacing special education, though (not to my knowledge at least!) <br /> <br />I like the ring of RISE classroom, RISE program. Sounds much nicer <br />than Autism class. <br /> <br />I guess it could also be REACHING independence through structured <br />education, that sounds okay too! <br /> <br />Any other ideas?<div class=\'post_sig\'>-   \"We should not strive to change the child with autism to fit the learning environment; rather we need to change the learning environment to fit the learning characteristics of the child.\" (TEACCH)</div>'
'<P>Hi Lucy, what does the IEP say the goal is and what did they put it under? </P> <P>Her flapping can help keep her regulated and from getting too overstimulated. Kind of like a kettle lets out steam. Simply trying to get her to do \"quiet hands\" may end up being like pushing down a bump in the carpet... three more humps may pop up. </P> <P>For us, even in behavior therapy they never focussed on stims or unwanted behavior. They said that as the child learned more skills the \"stims\" naturally decreased. </P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by OZZIE-ROZIES-MA on March 11 2011 at 9:19pm</span>'

'<P>He doesn\'t have an IEP? The MUST fully test before they give an IEP. If you haven\'t started that process, do so. The best guide for making sure the District doesn\'t pull the wool over your eyes is FROM EMOTIONS TO ADVOCACY, which you can find at <A href=\"http://www.wrightslaw.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.wrightslaw.com</A> or at Amazon. <BR></P> <P>Ask IMMEDIATELY that a Functional Behavioral Assessment be performed. Any child can have this done. It\'s a formal observation that should result in an entirely positive Behavior Intervention Plan.</P> <P>But if your child is not making academic progress, get a full psychoeducational evaluation. That will help the school know what to do. Good luck.</P>'
