I find they come out best on 375 for about 30-35 mins on a baking stone lined w/ parchment paper.  Sometimes I turn off the oven and leave them in for another few minutes to dry out and become crisper.  You can puree a squash for mashed potatoes (maybe mix in some ckn broth) or you can cook cauliflower and then put it in a food processor w/ some salt, maybe some garlic.  Comes out pretty similar to mashers.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to Rosie, 7yrs - ASD Long Island, NY</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to Rosie, 7yrs - ASD Long Island, NY</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello, I started my son on this 2 weeks ago it was the one for $48.  In 2 weeks my sons language has improved, socialization has improved and stools improved within 3 days to being fully solid and he is going 2 times a day and wanting to eat often which before he had very little appetite.  The improvements started immediately and have slowly built as the days have gone by.  All his therapists have been so excited about the improvements they are seeing in him.  His preschool teachers have come to me the last few times excited about his improvements also.  Everyone is noticing them in such a short period of time.  Now for the negatives.  My son reacts to everything and this is no exception I was giving 1/2 capsule 2 times a day and he was not sleeping well at night, sometimes getting up 7 or 8 times and constantly wanting to drink and having a bellyache.  I have decreased it to 1/2 capsule in the morning and now he is sleeping most of the night.  Even at this small dose there have been improvements.  When I increase to 3/4 capsule he gets a terrible belly ache and I have to back off.  This product is well worth the money I think.  I have seen just as much improvement with this as I did with the cytoflora, my son just couldn\'t handle the cytoflora.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Caringdad71 and thank you for replying to my question in such detail. I have read your reply many times and think I understand what you are saying and I have also read the two articles you sent the links for.    At present, I give my daughter 100mg of SAMe every three days in order to help her methylation - I do not give it to her more often as I am trying to avoid a build up of homocysteine as you refer to in your post. Before, I was giving her 150gm of SAMe every day and while we saw good gains at first, after a few weeks she was somehow off. I am trying to avoid this happening again while at the same time trying to balance the amount fo SAMe so it won\'t build up.    You write that later on I can give her methionine to help support the \'long way\' of methylation and you also suggest adding DMG. Do you mean to stop SAMe and just give methionine and DMG  or  to  give SAMe and DMG together while slowly phasing out the SAMe? My daughter\'s last  organic acid test showed she had higher HVA relative to VMA. It seems to me that methylation is a very tricky subject!!!</div>'

Then again we are finally getting more agressive and perhaps smarter about controlling the yeast and Clostridia now (so maybe it was the Sac-B, etc).    Our typical schedule (after ramp up) is as follows:    [School days]    6AM - one threelac + one sac-B    after school - one Culturelle plus one Primal Defense Ultra    9PM  - one threelac + one sac-B or Culturelle  [wake him up if needed so ~2-3 hours after meals and other supplements]     [non-School days]    6AM - one threelac + one sac-B    11AM - one Culturelle plus one Primal Defense Ultra    ~3-3:30PM or pre-Dinner by 1 hour - one threelac + one sac-B    late day - Culturelle plus whatever    The Threelac is a lemony powder that he\'s fine with, and would probably be easier for a kid that can\'t swallow pills.

For instance if the glutathione is low then the whole cycle of how these supplements absord into the body can be thrown off according to Dr. Cave. MB-2, Glutathione, Folinic acid, DMG they all work in a cycle. If you\'re low in one it may block another from working right in the body.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Fuzzyone,  Well, I had wondered in the past about possible diabetes, but she was tested and they said it was not a problem.  It is only recently that I\'ve been considering hypoglycemia.  But I had not tied the &quot;seizure&quot; stuff to that, but only to the fact that she seem to need to eat often, and needs protein.  so I\'m really, really glad you suggested this.  I just got the Bock book in the mail today and he talks about the fact that hypoglycemia is a big issue in the 4-A kids.    I have been letting my dd eat a lot more carbs lately as I\'ve been trying to get some weight on her; I haven\'t been balancing the carbs and protein like I did for years here.  I am wondering if this has lead to the mood swings--and the &quot;seizure&quot; stuff I mentioned.  She is responsive, but is shaking all over, with her teeth chattering.  She says she gets something she calls &quot;scary tummy&quot; before this begins.  I had really thought maybe parasites.  Now this is interesting--I have treated many times for parasites, and the first two treatments helped, but I feel the last couple have maybe made her worse. So I have not treated her recently.  I am wondering tonight if the Vermox, which damages the parasites\' ability to use sugars, does something bad to my dd\'s sugar metabolism as well.  Hmmmm.....  Also wondering tonight if WD\'s &quot;trick&quot; of protein at night to help his son sleep might be due to normalization of blood sugar.  For the rest of my family, carbs at night help for sleep, as suggested by Sidney Baker (that\'s where we got it from, anyway.)  Maybe protein for my dd at night might help.  She is also a sleepwalker, up about 1-2 hours after she goes to sleep.  Thank you again--your suggestion was at just the right time for me to &quot;get it.&quot;  I\'m betting this will be the ticket!

' <div class=\"postbody\">It is unlikely that the COQ10 itself caused any problems as it is very poorly absorbed in a dry form (i.e. requires a lipid).    The chewable tablet is pretty much useless unless it consumed with a fatty meal.  It is better to buy COQ10 in a soft-gel (and cut it open if he cannot swallow) or a liposomal formula.

' <div class=\"postbody\">We use 5-HTP in combination with GABA and Melatonin in the evenings.  I give about 25 mg of 5-HTP to my 30 pound son.  It helps him stay asleep once he gets asleep (that\'s where the melatonin comes in).  We have seen no negatives from this supplement.  It\'s usually recommended that you be giving a B6 supplement along with 5-HTP.  If you give a carbohydrate snack with it, it seems to be better absorbed as well.      The only side effect may be hyperactivity.  If you see that, you probably do not want to use this supplement (since it is having the opposite effect that you would want).  This supplement is basically used to produce tryptophan (the stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy).      I think if you are using any prescription drugs that affect seratonin, you might not want to mess with this supplement either (or stop the Rx drugs during the trial) -- as tryptophan also regulates seratonin.    We use Jarrow brand 5-HTP.  This has worked well for us.  We give GABA 3 x per day, 250 mg per dose.  We do not use the GABA with Inositol as higher doses of inositol caused problems for us.  He gets a very small amount of inositol in his multi (Kirkman\'s Spectrum Complete).  We use Solgar brand GABA.    Taurine is also a very good supplement to promote calmness.  We use about 250 mg per day (also Solgar).</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I had to sit (for hours!) and spoonfeed my son for two years until he was well enough to broaden his diet on his own.  We began biomed at age 4 and I was still feeding him his meals (much to my parents\' horror) when he was six.  But he was not able to make himself eat it on his own.  I mean, REALLY not able.  \"Letting him get hungry enough to eat\" did NOT do the trick--he was at a place where he truly would starve before he\'d eat, and looked like a concentration camp victim.    Maybe your son won\'t eat because he can\'t, like my son.  You might consider working on other things at the same time--zinc, supplements (see the Reliv post above) and a parasite treatment (pinworm medication from the drug store.)  THat might make him feel better and be able to eat.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

To be honest, I wish I could use it more, because from what I have seen with my kiddo, it definitely has helped him, has never hurt him, and seems to clear him up of <em>something</em> within hours.    The only reason why I haven\'t been able to use it consistently is believe it or not - his school. It makes you pee a lot and the urine smells a tad bit, well, like chlorella. They were questioning it, which really pissed me off. Of course, we have the same problem with authia. I put it on him at night, the next morning I wiped the skin area where I applied it to, and didn\'t smell a thing. Lo and behold, the school writes a note stating that the smell from his vitamin cream is making others sick (it looks to me like they want my son to remain autistic forever! I am beginning to hate them! With good reason!).    I actually really like NDF. Especially right after a round of chelation - it seems to literally clean up what is lying around, helps to prevent re-distribution.    I never told our DAN! that we are using it - I just simply use it - and plan to use it more!    Sorry for the long post - Good Luck!</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Interesting the connection with smells ... Hydrogen sulfide (the smell of rotten eggs, putrid water, etc) is quite toxic and REEKS. As long as you can smell it, you\'re OK. But if you STOP smelling it ... you are about to pass out!!!     I used to work with samples in a lab containing lots of hydrogen sulfide. It was bad enough smelling it, but I knew that if I stopped perceiving the stench, I had to get out of there in a hurry ... or be carried out in a stretcher.     Although from what Dana says, it is the opposite way with DMPS. Dana, you have trouble when you smell it? I wonder if the first batch of DMPS was going bad, and you were smelling a byproduct (more stinky) of the DMPS that was affecting you? I know that over time, glutathione (also a sulfur compound) smells more and more ... it is becoming oxidized and less effective. Possibly the same happens to DMPS?

You really have to give it a good five or six weeks without any changes to get your base line.    After the first couple of weeks just ensure that you are providing proper supplementation.  We follow Dr. N\'s protocol.    With us, we really didn\'t have too many negatives.  There were some very early morning awakenings and oral stims were crazy.    We\'ve been doing MB12 for well over a year now.  We even stepped up to daily but honestly I didn\'t see that much more in the way of positives.  Basically now we are at least every other day.    My feeling is that it\'s something that is still contributing to my sons recovery.  He is doing very well.    Greg</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">LnAmon, I think AC actually mentions using EDTA if you\'ve chelated for at least a year to make sure mercury is out-if you are sure there\'s no more mercury, he does have a schedule for it and dosing if necessary, I think he still doesn\'t like recommending it, but if lead is a big problem, you may look into it. Honestly, you may have to take a break from all chelation for a bit. If he\'s getting sick, netrophils may be down and that\'s not good. Being sick alot is a sign of this. DMSA does pull lead, I\'d even consider once you\'ve had a break for a while, using DMSA again but with modified citrus pectin. There\'s a study on it and it\'s very effective at pulling lead specifically. I use it here at the end of a round. It went on to say that 500% of lead was being dumped after 7 days on MCP <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" /> . Pretty impressive.   I won\'t lie and say that I\'m not a bit concerned about going on to use EDTA. If it\'s the stall or sickness that is preventing progress, maybe take a break and see if he starts to feel better this summer and start again after some good sun exposure and he\'s not around so many kids at school. I will also say that I think suppositories can be traumatic for some kids. I still remember my mom doing it for me when I was 3. Autistics have so many strange feelings around their bodies and putting this in as often as required for chelation can cause regression, imo. But, I look at that kind of stuff alot for treating my kid. We don\'t even draw blood anymore.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Diane,  I just changed the twins to daybed style in their cribs with one of the sides gone and replaced it with a toddler bed siderail.  My girls also share a room and will wake the other one up if fussing etc.  My girls have also been good sleepers all along...and really nothing has messed with that much.  They now can get out of their beds and therefore have basically eliminated their naps except for about every 4th day.  They are still sleeping at night, but are very tired (maybe over tired)and sometimes wake up talking or slight fussing.  If your twins\' sleep issues are not due to the LDN...it could be the phasing out of naps or nightmares.  My older 4 all went through a nightmare or scared wakings at night around 3 years old...and they were not exposed to anything but videos I chose.  I think it is a normal phase for some kids especially when their imagination kicks in etc.  It could be normal.    On the other hand...I don\'t know what the half life of the LDN is...we are going to be starting it within the next several weeks or month.  But I understood it to affect the Circadian rhythms and I wonder if it could still affect the sleep/wake cycle after the med was no longer given for a while.  I really don\'t know.  I think it would be good to figure out though.  Maybe after the sleep issues subside - then I would try to reintroduce the LDN in tiny doses and if the same sleep issues occur...you have found your answer.  Hopefully as very tiny dose will give good results without many side effects...this stuff sure seems to be hard to regulate at first.    I know exactly what you mean about keeping the twins straight.  I actually have a chart that is in a 2 inch binder that has tabs for meds/supps, stools, food diaries, behavior changes etc...and I have to check off things as they happen or I give them - I made the charts on a spread sheet with the help of my friend...because if I had to write every single thing down everyday, I would go even loonier than I already am!!  You might want to try something like that.  For so long the girls were on the exact same things, but not really anymore...atleast not the same doses etc...so I have to keep it all straight!!!

Just start out gradually with 1 drop, then increase to 1 drop 3 times a day, then 2 drops 3 times a day - gradually increasing the doze.  Monitor your child\'s reaction.  Make sure you give NCD separate from vitamins and minerals. It can by put into liquid or food - doesn\'t have a taste or smell.  Very easy to use.  A doctor would usually order a Urine toxic metals test both pre and post-NCD, just to see how much metals it pulls out.  You can order this test yourself with Direct Laboratory Services.

He says that we need to take in higher levels like the Japanese.  These are high doses for instance the WHO recommends 1mg and from what I\'ve read Japanese women take in 12.5mg/day and have less breast &amp; uterine cancer.  I don\'t know if I can post his website for you to look at or not.  Anyways my research on iodine indicates that it chelates mercury, kills yeast and bacterias, stores in the body and bumps the junk out of the way so it can store its self there.  Iodine has also been associated with intelligence.  Everything I\'ve read says to be careful supplementing kids with Iodine.  Does anyone know why that is or have any experience in this area?  Of course he recommends thryoid monitoring and testing during use.  I\'m just wondering because the side effects of chelation sound scary, but this he\'s used with a lot of success in adults.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Jen78fl,  I\'ve always been been awed and amazed by your dedication, perserverance, and willingness to try new things.  I remember how scared I was that my son talk much and being so frightened by the people who said if he didn\'t have therapy by age three and didn\'t talk by age five.......     I think they are often very wrong and there isn\'t a window or door that slams shut at five.  My son\'s progress didn\'t really start until 3 1/2 and really only took off between 4 1/2 and 5.    One of the kids at my son\'s preschool uses PECS sometimes, but he does talk.  When I was talking to his mom about how cool the PECS were, she said he didn\'t say a word or make  a sound until he was four.  He\'s five and he\'s enrolled in a regular preschool now.  It\'s going pretty well from what I can see.  I\'ll find out tommorow since he is coming to my house for a play date with S.    Have you tried PECS or sign language?  I also was going to suggest Leap Frog and baby bumble bee videos.    Liz</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Rosiemom - so great to hear you\'re seeing good things from working with Mary Coyle. I think she\'s very well respected within the homeopathic community. She hosted her own show on Autism One for about a year I think. Anyone interested in listening to those archived shows should be able to do so by googling her name along with Autism One. I listened to all of her shows as well as Amy Lansky\'s when I was first thinking about homeopathy. She (Mary C.) had Cindy Griffin and Lindyl Lanham from HCH as guests on one hour where they discussed homotoxicology and sequential therapy. I\'ll see if I can\'t find that link and post it here. Very informative for those interested in learning more about homeopathy.  HCH uses homotoxicology to detox as well. I think they use different products than Mary does but they are both attempting to go about opening the detox pathways and strengthen the immune system. Her story regarding recovering her son is an inspirational one. I believe he was pretty severe at 5 years old before she started working with Greg Ellis from PA to detox him. I think she\'s taken what Ellis did (over ten years ago at this point) modified it a bit, and came up with her own method. I looked at her website and wasn\'t aware she did sequential therapy as well. Aisha - she may be a better resource for you than HCH given the cost factor and that you need help with two children. Rosiemom - will she eventually work with you in clearing vaccines?   FYI to all: there is a European homeopath by the name of Tinus Smits who has been using sequential therapy with autistic kids for awhile now. He has been training homeopaths throughout Europe and a few in the United States I believe on his CEASE (Complete Eradication of Autistic Symptom Expression) method. Here is an interesting interview where he discusses his work:  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.hpathy.com/interviews/tinus-smits.asp\">http://www.hpathy.com/interviews/tinus-smits.asp</a><!-- m --> and here is his website where you can read more about him as well as case studies of autistic kids: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.tinussmits.com/3847/about-dr.-smits.aspx\">http://www.tinussmits.com/3847/about-dr.-smits.aspx</a><!-- m --> Exciting stuff for sure!! Looks like he mixes some classical homeopathy in with sequential. Whatever works to make kids better from this scourge!  Homeopathy Center of Houston is cost prohibitive for many but there are others who do what they do. One just has to investigate and get referrals, etc.   For those wanting to know more about HCH, I received permission from a mom currently working with HCH since the spring to post a link to her son\'s recovery blog:  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://drewsautismdiary.blogspot.com/\">http://drewsautismdiary.blogspot.com/</a><!-- m -->  Joanna does a great job in explaining the HCH protocol (check out her archives) and her son\'s reactions as he goes through the clearing process. Her son is a doll baby and he\'s really doing great! He\'s gone from non-verbal to 40 words in a matter of months. Hope those of you interested find it informative.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ ******************************** Mom to recovering ASD boy - 5yrs</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ ******************************** Mom to recovering ASD boy - 5yrs</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Our son is having horrible allergy symptoms already!    We have seen a pattern of regression every spring/early summer for the last two years.  I am talking BIG regression where he stops talking, loses all focus, wants do nothing but rip leaves, and tantrums/aggressive behaviors like biting.    His nose is bothering him so much, and he is getting extremely agitated.    We are about to get our 4th LDA shot and are hoping to eventually erradicate this problem, but it is obviously not helping yet.    We also started 1 line of LDN recently.  I know that sometimes this can bring viruses out, but the only symptom my son has is a stuffy nose, and my sinuses have been bad as well.    Zyrtec did NOTHING to help him yesterday, and we have had no luck with OTC meds for him like Benadryl.    Does anyone have suggestions for how to help him?  We cannot even teach the poor kid how to blow his nose!    He has been progressing rapidly with HBOT, MB-12, Zeolite, the supplements on Dr. Neubrander\'s supplement review form, and a new VB program...he is more \"with us\" than ever, talking more than ever, and he is even playing independently and initiating \"chase\" games with his little brother.    We know that HBOT will help with inflammation in the brain from the histamines, but his sinuses were so bad last night, we were afraid to put him in there!    I do not want him to have ANOTHER big regression, and I am afraid that is where we will be heading if we do not find something NOW to get this under control.    Thanks in advance for any advice you have to help us to be procative!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ M.S.    \"I will leave no stones unturned to help my son reach his potential.\"</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ M.S.    \"I will leave no stones unturned to help my son reach his potential.\"</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Thank you both for your responses. I really appreciate it. What is CLO?   I took him for our neighbors son\'s birthday party today evening (just after few hours ) and he behaved fine there. I was so nervous about taking him there but he is totally fine. Our neighbor\'s son is one year younger than my son. He is gentle with another boy who is 10 months old. Even when the 10 month old boy tried to tap my son\'s cheeks he did not react badly. Kari, your thought is good, he might be getting better with his receptive language because he hit the same birthday boy yesterday when they are playing outside when the other kid tried to take his car. Before he used to just give his toys to this other boy if he wants to take it. We have an IEP in place, they recommended ST, OT and PE for him. We are moving to another state in few weeks and the new state is going to consider our current IEP. Even though school district classified my son as moderately autistic, the children center in our city dismissed it and they diagnosed it as Mixed Receptive Expressive Language Disorder. I am going to get him checked again in NYC once we move there for the second opinion. If Multi are improving his receptive language is it advisable to stop them and see? If I continue and if he becomes violet then the new school might put him in a restrictive environment. If I stop this multi should I try another brand\'s multi. Please advise.Thank you for your time.</div>'

Prior to starting chelation, our DAN doctor sent us the Autism Research Institute\'s consensus paper on detoxification for us to read.      If you look at page 17 of the paper, which I\'ve linked below, it says, under the section labeled Mineral Supplementation, that \" Because of poor nutrition (often due to idiosyncratic food preferences), poor absorption, and other, poorly understood factors, autistic children usually have numerous mineral deficiencies. Chief among these deficiencies is zinc. Zinc supplements should be given prior to, during and after detoxification therapy.\"    Here\'s the consensus paper on detoxification.   <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.autismwebsite.com/ari/vaccine/heavymetals.pdf\">http://www.autismwebsite.com/ari/vaccin ... metals.pdf</a><!-- m --></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #800000\">There are many paths to autism.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi,  1mg of p5p = 5 mg of regular vit B6.  Therefore, p5p being the active metabolite of pyrodoxine is 5 times more powerful.   B6/p5p has many diversified roles including serving as a coenzyme for neurotransmitter synthesis like serotonin, epinephrine and GABA to name a few.  Specifically, b6 is required for the transformation of tryptophan to serotonin and later eventually downstream, to niacin (vit B3).  Some of the serotonin is \'saved\' and when it is methylated, some melatonin is produced by our pineal glands.  Melatonin is a hormone that regulates our body clock in that it sets our sleep cycle.  It also serves as an antioxidant.  You may wish to add in some more magnesium steadily to help relaxation as well as cooperative work with the b6.  Additionally, you may consider lowering the dose of p5p.  Finally, you may try administering it at breakfast in the morning.  The b vitamins in general can be energizers and thus, cause alertness/wakefulness, vitamin b6 being no exception.  Furthermore, excessive b6 can enhance neurotoxicity (common problem in ASD kids), since it drives the transformation of kynurenate(normally calming) to quinolinate (excitatory).  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolinic_acid\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolinic_acid</a><!-- m -->  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KP_pathway.jpg\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KP_pathway.jpg</a><!-- m -->  (diagram)  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kynurenine_pathway\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kynurenine_pathway</a><!-- m -->  If you have your child\'s recent OAT test, check to see the levels of kynurenic acid and quinolinic acid to see if they are in range.

He was doing good when you saw him before but now it seems like he\'s just sailing through life.  Nothing bothers him anymore. He still doesn\'t like to be told he can\'t play his playstation, but I doubt any kid would like that.    He was in the bathroom today and we had just bought a generic brand of toilet paper that I had never bought before.  He said, \"Mom, this is Tempo.\" (Brand of toilet paper) I am so amazed at how he can figure out pretty much any word now. And he has so much fun doing it.     Oh and two days ago we were driving home at about 9pm at night. So it was really dark. And him and his sister started making up stories.  His sister said, \"We are falling from the sky.\" Then he said, \"And we have parachutes.  There\'s one, two, three parachute.\"  (Three of us in the car.)  Then I said, \"Oh no, we hit a bird.\"  Then Gavin said, \"Watch out we only have two parachutes now.\"  THen my daughter said that we were landing in the ocean on a ship.  Then Gavin says, \"And we are going down now in a submarine.\"  It was amazing how they both were just pretending to do these things together.  I don\'t know if life gets better than this.   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />  But I look forward to the new ideas he is sharing each day!

I also have the option of switching to hardshell hBOT but that\'s available only at 1.5 ATA 100%oxygen. I\'ve noticed that when I do 5 days at a stretch i see very good gains.

I am soooo sad to hear your response.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" />  I have relied on your advise many, many times. (Since I am not divulging my identity, I know you can\'t really understand how much so). Please don\'t take this as an attach, because it certainly is not meant that way, but I am truly flabbergasted that someone of your obvious intelligence would buy into this treatment. I too have read the testimonies of the people who claim that NAET worked, and I can only say that I believe that they were either brainwashed or fools themselves. I know that the mind has a tremendous amount of influence over the body, but come on! Please tell me that you do not truly believe that a person can tell you your personal allergies just by having you hold a vial containing that substance and then pulling on the other arm to test for weakness? I do understand how accupuncture works and I wouldn\'t disregard its effect on pain. But the whole idea of performing accupuncture/accupressure on someone while they look at the offending substance.........??????? I am sorry, but there is no way that I can swallow that. It defies all logic. Besides, the lady that came up with this method claimed that she cured herself of allergic reactions to Vitamins B, C, and A.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" /> Does anyone really buy that a person can be allergic to essential vitamins? Yes, a person may be unable to tolerate high doses, but again.... Come on!  I can\'t even get into the surrogate testing. There\'s not enough time in this day to express my complete opinion on that subject. I guess if you believe in this treatment, I can\'t change your mind. (although I wish I could) <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /> I would hate to see anyone spend money on something that I believe is total BS. But to each his own.    As far as my DAN! goes, he/she could not even explain what goes own, AND HE/SHE IS DOING THIS FOR THEIR OWN CHILD!!!! When we pressured for answers, we were told that all he/she could say was that he/she \"thought of it as voodoo.\" Well that\'s what I want for my child. (NOT!) How can a doctor recommend something that they can\'t give an explaination for. If I wanted voodoo I would take my son to a voodoo doctor. This is not what I expected from a professional. My husband almost walked out on the meeting.  Maybe I should just overlook it if it\'s something that other DAN! are buying into. But I think this whole thing will just give the biomed critics another reason to call us quacks.    Again, please don\'t take any of this as a personal attach. I would never purposely offend anyone.

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">I gave him Benadryl yesterday morning, which seemed to take the edge off of his behavior and mood a little. My gut feeling is that he is having a yeast flare-up and/or a histamine reaction. I\'d appreciate Dana, Tami or anyone else\'s take on this. It\'s frustrating because cognitively he is doing well and this \"issue\" is really holding him back and making him (and the rest of us) miserable. </div>    Dana R,  Since you already noticed a positive reaction to the Benadryl, it\'s probably pretty likely that he\'s got high histamines.  The histamines don\'t cause Gavin to lose any cognitive functions.  They do make it hard for him to focus and give him many symptoms like aggression, saying bad words, \"boy behaviors,\" yeasty behaviors (yeast increasing histamines so this makes sense), itchy skin, and frustration.    The things we were prescribed were cal/mag, zinc, B6, MB12, methionine and TMG (though we discontinued this because of the MB12).   The things that are most helpful are 1)NDF PLUS...behaviors went away after very first dose.  This was two years ago.  The school was about to take him out of his regular class because of his behaviors.  Added in 4 drops of NDF PLUS. NExt day it was gone.   Though we later on still had ups and downs with histamines. It never got to that extreme point.  2)methionine  I gave this to him everyday.  Definitely definitely helps.  ANytime he has obvious histamines, I just up the dose for a while.  3)MB12 at one time took Gavin\'s remaning sensory issues away.  But we have notice that it does cause yeast flare ups which aggravates the histamines.    Avoid folinic acid at all cost.  It really seems to aggravate the symptoms.  I\'d say go with your mommy\'s instinct.   Hope this helps and let us know how he does!

' <div class=\"postbody\">Any mercury chelated directly by ALA will come out in the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><em><strong>POOP</strong></em></span>.  You could test that too, but you don\'t have a baseline there so I\'m not sure what you\'d compare it too.  The urine will now probably only contain the mercury that the DMSA picked up after it got dropped by ALA (before making it all the way out of the body).   Again though, my bet is that you\'re in a &quot;stall period&quot;.  Basically, you\'ve gotten the easy stuff out of the places that the DMSA can reach - i.e. kidneys, blood, etc.  The DMSA doesn\'t go very deep into the body or into cells, etc.  The ALA does do exactly that.  However, it takes the metals more time to make their way out of the deep tissue, brain, etc.  Stop leaning on the urine test as a measure of progress.  It will only tell you what came out in the urine (via DMSA) and mostly from the kidneys and other easy stores.  Sadly, even Cutler says there really aren\'t any good measures of full body burden of mercury.  Each test has some pretty pronounced flaws.  [As an alternative to urine tests, you could also try porphyrin or hair tests, though those are inconclusive too.]    As hard as it is to rely on, the best measure of progress is your kid and how he behaves over time.  Be patient and keep plugging.  We did minimal testing.  We were getting pretty frustrated just before the 1 year mark.  Just then the yeast began to clear, and the improvement became much more obvious and things have been slowly getting even better since (in fits and starts).  From what others have posted on the Yahoo! A-M group, that may be pretty typical.  The pattern that I think I see before we see more progress is that he gets foggier/spacier (as the metals are coming out again from a deeper store), then he comes out of it and is better than before.  [1-2 steps backward, but then 2-4 steps forward.]   If you keep at it for long enough, I think you\'ll see some of the permanent gains you\'re looking for.  The &quot;stall period&quot; is a expletive removed though, and you\'ll question yourself (whether it\'s working, whether you\'re doing the right thing, etc) many times before he comes out of it.  Patience and perseverance.   Best wishes to you and yours.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Folks,    I wanted to share an updated with our HDD trial, and see how other folks were doing.    a) We are now 2.5 weeks into the new protocal.  We\'ve seen modest progress with alertness.   He\'s modestly more responsive and aware, we think...    b) On the down side, we\'ve also continued to see a jump in stimming.  What he does is \"babble\" as we say, where he speaks to himself in a sing song voice...  There\'s definitely been a jump in this.  Also, in general, there\'s been hyperactivity, he\'s more wiggly.  We\'ve also seen a jump in his frustration level in general.  He\'s less patient....    So it\'s unclear at this point, what our final read is here.      But our assessment is complicated by a few other factors.  Remi started about 1.5 weeks ago his second cycle of HBOT dives.  I think, for example, we may be seeing yeast die-off associated with the dives (it happened the first time).  So I don\'t know if some of what we are seeing is this.      There\'s also been a cold going around my children in the family, from going back to school, and I think Remi may have been fighting off that.  At times, with illness, Remi will regress.    So anyway, I\'m bit confused, and am going to hold steady for another week or two, probably, through the first month.     Thanks,    Adam</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Copper is bad because a lot of people (and many ASD kids) are low in zinc/high in copper. Copper prevents zinc from being absorbed. Estrogen (in pregnancy or from other sources) increases copper. So you probably don\'t need more. But extra zinc is really good. Iron is really poorly absorbed in supplement form and can feed bad gut bugs so getting iron from food sources is much better. (Everything from food sources is better! But a good prenatal covers your bases.)  If it was me I\'d use a higher potency multi-strain probiotic. If cost is a factor it is more cost effective if you use it as a starter to make your own ferments.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />  Edited to add: I didn\'t know this until recently but zinc is also a huge factor in many birth defects.

' <div class=\"postbody\">ORAT,  Natasa posted a long time ago about how calcium channel dysfunction was a core issue in her kid\'s autism; you could search through the old posts and read her thoughts.  I did find this:  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">My rough take on all this would be: impaired methylation/gluthatione/detox leading to viral/bacterial/metal overload which in turns affects ion signalling (calcium in particular) and Central Nervous System function - I know this is all very simplified and only circumstantial at this point, but my mother\'s instinct is telling me I\'m right on this one and would bet all I\'ve got on it being the cas).   I believe dysfunctions in calcium homeostasis are probably at the end of the chain of events that lead to symptoms of autism, but a very important/strong factor, and if only we knew it for sure we would be then able to treat symptoms FIRST, GET OUR KIDS BETTER FAST and then slowly work on removing the real causes! in my dreamworld.   There are many things that regulate calcium channels, these are I believe mostly used in cardiac problems, where most of the research and trials on these is carried out. Not sure how much is known on their use in CNS.   There are many drugs and substances that regulate calcium metabolism in one way or another, of course no research so far on their use in autism, again not sure about general CNS research. I\'m thinking here e.g vitamin D and its synthetic analogues, and other synthetic derivatives.   On the other hand, I spend last few days researching things that seemed to help my son\'s symptoms the most, and most of them have been proven to regulate calcium metabolism/absorbtion in one way or another: SCD (see below), LDN (Naltrexone regulates calcium, most probably through L-type calcium channels it seems!), milk thistle, l-carnitine, low oxalate diet (actually medium ox diet in our case!). </div>   Also, she posted that Inflammation Control by Vitamin Research Products had an herb that was a calcium channel modulator &amp; her son had great improvement with it.  Might be worth looking into.  Renae</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">When Sasha\'s gut was at it\'s worst we did scd and it did help tremensously. We only did it for about 3-4 months but when we did I went cold turkey. His Oxalate levels did rise during that time b/c of all the almond flour I was using. His gut healed from what it was in a very short amount of time. He went from runny rank smelling poop to formed stools.   During the time he was on it I was also giving tons of diflucan and flagal prescribed by his pediatrician. We did about 3 OAT\'s during that period and his levels did improve tremendously.     For me it was very hard to stick with it. I continued to give ThreeLac every single say (2 packs a day) and I honestly think that the ThreeLac kelped him come off of SCD b/c it\'s keeping his yeast under control. That is just my guess though. He still eats high carb foods but I do keep rice and potato flours out of his diet for the most part. Even potato chips, I now give beet chips which are pretty good.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Aisha--The only new thing I started was the ALA this weekend.  I like to space out new supplements to really see what is working and what\'s not working, so I know the ALA made a difference right away.    If you can, Google all the info you can on Andy Cutler and his DMSA/ALA chelation protocl and schedule.  He recommends dosing schedules and amount of chelator per pound of the child.  His method is very low and slow.  Here is his schedule:  <strong>Dosage:  DMSA (alone or in combination with ALA): 1/8 to 1/2 mg of DMSA per pound of body weight, per dose  ALA (alone or in combination with DMSA): 1/8 to 1/2 mg of ALA per pound of body weight, per dose </strong>    The DMSA has to be given every 4 hours for 3 days.  ALA every 3 hours for 3 days.  I believe you have to let the body rest for the same amount of time you chelate.  I think most people follow 3 days on, 11 days off.    What has worked best for us is detoxing the body as best as we could before really going at chelation.  It\'s so true that you have to have the liver and colon and kidneys working efficiently so when you do chelation, these organs can filter out the yucky stuff so it doesn\'t redistribute and make things worse.      For the past 7 months I have been giving my son green lemonade, which is just juicing a mixture of green veggies (lettuce, kale, broccoli, cucumbers, etc.) with one lemon every day.  If you do research on lemons, they are fabulous liver cleansers with antiviral and antiparasitic properties.  I also add green powder to it for an added dose of green alkaline power.  I believe getting our bodies as alkaline as possible helps the body function better and reduces inflammation.  Robert Young\'s book \"The pH miracle\" is a great reference.    I give my son Primal Defense Ultra every day and coconut kefir for probiotics which has been great is getting his stools normal.  He poops twice a day now and has never been constipated since drinking the green lemonade.  My daughter drinks it too and within 30 minutes she poops! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" />     Have you looked into the ProEFA for speech?  I give my son 1 capsule daily of this and we have been using it for about 3 months now.  It is supposed to help with expressive speech.    I also use homeopathy and cranial sacral therapy.  I think both are a must for detoxing.  My son is a like a different kid after his adjustment. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />  My homeopathy does phone consultations if you want her number.  I think her website is up and running too.  Her name is Sally Williams.    My son is still nonverbal, but his desire to communicate with us is increasing, which is exciting for us.

Or, what if he\'s getting better, but the aluminum\'s not moving?  For us, we are putting our eggs into the - it\'s the aluminum - basket.  If we, through chelation, get all of the aluminum out yet he still has symptoms, we need to look elsewhere for the remedy. But how would we know we got all the aluminum out without an analysis?</div>'

I haven\'t decided or even got the results back from the tests! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" />   All I know is that Drew is a happier, healthier child thanks to the DAN! protocol!  No more constipation, aggressive behavior, no more screaming in pain from sensory issues, no more night terrors, he is reading, riding a two wheeler, laughing, singing, playing pretend, making friends, almost up to par with his speech, no more rashes, drooling, vomiting, staring into space, crying non-stop...   So if I am such a bad parent for wanting a healthy, happy child and one of a \"few\" that is vocal for our children, then sue  me!    Hi! Kathleen    Hope you enjoyed my post.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Last year during the time I was revamping my sonâ€™s vitamin regimen. (Also seeing what he no longer needed)  At this time we were running trials to see which new vitamin he likes as well as considering the dose amounts of supplement and how to increase some in other areas.    Anyway we had a period during these trials that my son started to become wacky/ silly at night and could not figure out what may have caused it. We were not doing anything different besides multies trials at that time. I though yeast yeast yeast and went crazy. Then I stated to change other things, which made it worse.  I had asked a few biomoms who I respect very much. And low and behold after 2-3 e mails one mom told me about a study that showed some children do not tolerate P5P and  it may bring about the same signs as a phenol issues.  I know those days because that was one of the first things we went through cleaning up my sons gut years ago.  Soâ€¦. we dropped the one multi that contained the P5P and the symptoms stopped the next day never to return.     Im not sure if that was the ONLY culprit considering how many things we changed when it happened.  But I can tell you we did isolate something and it is still highly possible    This is just a hunch based on what I had heard and saw with my child . Sorry  I never retried that multi again with  the P5P after we found one that worked well with my son.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Jen,  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Anyway, so she suggested that I should either try to make the same things they are serving at school, which really I dont think I would be able to manage that, and it probably wouldnt work since hed still know the difference... Or that maybe we should try a week of letting him have cafeteria food and see how he does.</div>  I think my interpretation is a bit different. It sounds to me that your son is and has been outwardly showing that he really wants the same thing that the other kids are eating. And she recognizes that as a problem not only for him but for the other kids. So in an attempt to try to come up with a solution, she is asking you to see if making similar foods would appease him to the point where he doesn\'t try to take the other kids foods or if it would be okay to attempt the school food. She probably doesn\'t understand (even if you\'ve explained it to her) that even small amounts of gluten and dairy can be extremely aggravating for him. Most people don\'t.  It doesn\'t sound like she\'s saying that she is not supportive of the diet but is asking for assistance in this situation trying to encourage him to eat his own food.     I have always made my son the same thing we were eating. If we had pizza, he had GFCF pizza. If we had spagetti, he had GFCF spagetti. There really is a GFCF version for everything now adays and if you need a recipe, let me know. My son used to be upset when the other kids would eat things he loved. So I would make him similar foods when this was the case. It may just be something simple like you get some GFCF pretzels or GFCF cookies and have them keep them at school for the teacher to give him when needed.  This made my son very happy as he felt more like the other kids. Our kids are smart and being different is not easy.  Giving them something similar may seem silly to us, but to them it really can make a difference. I would consider it.   I was very appreciative of my son\'s teacher asking me to bring some things into school to keep for special treats so he could have the same thing the other kids have (or close).     I think teachers are similar to us; trying to make sense of a situation there really is no handbook to. Even if she did not have the right answer, the fact that she\'s keeping the communication open with you is great. She is your eyes into his day at school and right now she\'s telling you that the food situation is not working out well. It\'s your move to tell her to deal with it with behavior modification or offer to send some GFCF foods that may make him less likely to steal the other kids foods.   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Tami</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Tami</div>'

Our son also had fine stools, with few signs of any digestive problems (had a bit of a distended belly earlier, but nothing conclusive).    We started him on MB-12 and within a few days we saw some very positive signs.  More flexibility, more spontaneity, better language, etc.  Teachers at his school noticed as well, w/o our letting them know what we were doing.  [e.g. We started MB-12 in May, 5 weeks before school let out.  Independently, the Speech Therapist commented, \"Your son has really been doing much better the last 5 weeks or so...\"]    Gains since due to MB-12, diet, and supplements have been impressive and I think we\'re being pretty objective.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello all,    Well I just wrote this morning on the enhansa thread on how well my son has been doing on the enhansa and everything else.  Of course the school nurse calls this morning and Mick has a weird rash all over his body.  Not the normal rash I am used to everytime he has die off.  This is bloachy (sp??  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarassed\" /> ) red spots all over his neck, face, arms, hands, back and some even on his legs.  It is absolutely HORRIBLE.  He is also very itchy and very uncomfortable.  The doctor for all the schools was there and he checked him out.  He believed Mick might be having an allergic reaction to the Flagyl.  He is on day 9 of it and only had 1 more day to go.      Okay his DAN doc just called back and said it is probable just a allergic reaction to the Flagyl and since he was almost done with it and it probably did what it needed to do, to stop it.  I was told to give him a warm bath with oatmeal (for the itching) and to give benedryl and that should help.

' <div class=\"postbody\">At one of our MANY visits to the constiaption clinic, castor oil was a topic.  Yes it is effective, but it does pose a danger with kids.  The reason it is not recommended any more is due to the risk of inhalation and suffocating.  I myself at the age of 36 took a teaspoon of rx cough syrup and inhaled it (36, you think I\'d be safe lol).  It was the most terrifying experience of my life and my (future) DH said even he thought I was going to die.  Just wanted to warn you, I know there are amazing benefits and for some this certainly is a choice to give and a helpful one at that.  Just wouldn\'t feel right if I didn\'t warn is all.  I have had great success with Senna and Ducosate Sodium.  Eventually able to wean off the Senna, and now even on a every other day with the Ducosate, which is HUGE for my son after severe constipation for years.

Here\'s my two cents because I have a gut kid who is overrun with yeast issues and had c diff as well. I would ramp up the probiotics. My daughter is 30lbs and 2.5y/o she takes 3-4 Klaire Detox Support (50 billion each), 2-3 sacc B, 4-5 culturelle, 1/2 teaspoon of therabiotic infant formula, 75  mg of diflucan and also amphotericin (I can\'t recall the dose on that...125 maybe) and I do transdermal OoO. I\'m still not convinced I do enough, but it\'s all helping quite a bit. When I was doing closer to what you are doing it got slightly better but then got worse.   Super Nu Thera is really hard for kids to tolerate. My dd didn\'t tolerate that either. Have you checked out either DRN or the vitamins by BrainChild? I would do a good multi first. if you do a search  you\'ll come up with a few threads of vitamin recommendations.

After the OSR (8 months or so) Mercury was finally coming out in the hair test.  ( a small amount but some is better than none) also Urinary Porpheryn Test was also much improved.

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">I am now thinking along the same lines regarding biomed. If i \"think\" my son is ill, am i encouraging it somehow, on a subconscious level by spending so much time on biomed, worrying about this or that, or missing out on this or that? </div> I think if you have negative thoughts/actions, negative things tend to come your way. (Just my belief). But please don\'t let anyone misunderstand that I do not IN ANY WAY believe that our negative thoughts bring upon autism. I think there were many things at work that does that, much outside of our control.  I just think that the more good thoughts you have, the more you see good things and good stuff comes your way.  Anyways, the first prayer I taught Gavin (and he still says it to this day) was before he could say much at all and he was still very sick. I wanted him to already assume he was fine, he was well, God had healed him.  The prayer is short cause I wanted him to be able to repeat it after me without getting frustrated,  \"Dear Jesus, thank you for healing me, I love you A-Men.\"   Autism changed my family, my beliefs, my outlook on life, on the idea that everyone is basically good.   I am an optimist at heart and so the best thing I did when I found out about my son is I removed as many of the \'negative\' influences in my life that were going to take any energy away from my work in getting Gavin well.  My uncle who said, \"Autism CANNOT be cured\" or my friends who looked at me like I was on drugs- I just stopped being in touch with them. I embraced those who believed as I did, \"RECOVERY IS POSSIBLE\" and that became my goal.    Without my friends, my family, my faith (which was nonexistent before Gavin), there is no way that we would be where we are. I remember the first time I prayed in years was when I realized I couldn\'t do this all by myself. I just begged God to help me. I promised that if he just showed me the way to Gavin\'s recovery, I would help anyone he put in front of me. Little did I know that the journey to recovery would be this long and this hard and it would literally be me who had to make the journey. I would find myself lost and then pray for help and within one week I would have a new path to take, a new thing to try, and many times- they worked. So I was able to trust that if I just did my part, we would find the way. I believe that the road I\'ve been given is the road that is/has been leading Gavin to good health, mental functions and an incredible future.  I believe that we all have our unique situations which we are meant to learn from and our lives will be enriched. But I have to say, it\'s really hard to see that until you get to the point where your child is no longer sick and no longer suffering.  We just have to support eachother as much as possible until that day comes.    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">The reason I ask is that when we received our new home, there is only carpeting on the stairs, for safety reasons...no carpeting in any other areas.  Kiernan\'s eczema cleared up overnight. He has not had one bout of it since. Like magic...no carpet, no eczema.   There are alot of toxins in the carpet fibers and alot of little critters (mites).

' <div class=\"postbody\">My grandson started kindergarten this year, having some of his classes with the special education teacher.  In  the last month he has become aggressive at school - hitting, kicking, pushing.  It is not just isolated to one class room, it can happen at any place.   Noah is on GFCF diet and various supplements, that haven\'t changed at all.  He had started taking the metho-B12 &amp; TMG but was taken off of that to see if that would help cut down the aggression, but that didn\'t seem to help.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Karen S,  I just wanted to let you know that there is thimerosal in the thimerosal -free flu vaccine.  It may be reduced from the amounts before and they don\'t have to list it as an ingredient because they add it in the process of manufacturing, not as a preservative.  But the fact is that trace(who says what trace amounts are?) amounts are STILL in the flu vaccine.  So don\'t think for one minute you\'re getting something that\'s thimerosal free.   This is another LIE that the pharmacutical companies \"comfort\"us with so we\'ll just go with the program.  The MMR vaccine doesn\'t contain thimerosal. If they added thimerosal to this LIVE VIRUS vaccine, it would be killed.  The dangerous thing about the MMR is that it\'s usually administered to kids that have a compromised immune systems (from previous vaccines or are non excreters of heavy metal) and it can wreck havoc in the intestines futher depleting immune system function.  In some cases the measles virus will just take over.....</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #FF0040\"><strong> Save 5.00 on 1st order code VEG287</strong></span> http://www.iherb.com/  *Twins*</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________  Save 5.00 on 1st order code VEG287</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi all,    I have a couple recipes that I have gotten my son to eat and I thought I would share. They are pretty easy to make and my son eats them up and he is a pretty picky eater. I\'m lucky that he will eat most fruit, but he won\'t eat veggies by themselves so like a lot of you I have to sneak it into his meat dishes. I hope your kids will like these too!      <strong>SQUASH MEATBALLS</strong>    1 lb. Mixed raw meats  1/2 a cup of pureed squash  1 egg  1/2 cup almond flour  salt to taste    Combine all ingredients.  Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes til done.  I bake them on parchment paper so they don\'t stick.      <strong>TURKEY TOTS</strong>    1 cup of finely ground cooked turkey (better boiled then baked)  1/2 cup of ground green beans (or another veggie/s)  2-3 ground or cut raw garlic cloves  Palm or Coconut oil  Salt  Spices (optional)    Combine the chicken, green beans and garlic in a bowl or you can also  grind the chicken, green beans and garlic together in a food processor.  Add spices or seasoning if you like. It should come out moist and pasty like tuna salad.   Roll into little meatballs and flatten like patties.  Add sufficient amount of oil in a pan or they\'ll stick.  Fry trhe little patties on both side untill brown - medium heat  They should look like tiny breaded burgers.  Sprinkle with salt and enjoy.  (I use a thin metal spatchula to flip them because with a regular plastic spatchula they tended to break. They are sort of delicate before they are all the way cooked.)      <strong>COCONUT OMELETTES</strong>    1 egg  1/2 TBL honey  1 TLB coconut flakes    Beat egg and honey together, andd coconut flakes and mix well.  Prepare as pancakes.    This is the only way I have gotten my son to eat eggs. I can get him to eat this because it is sweet. I don\'t make it all the time because of all the honey. I mostly just make it on the weekends.        Both of these recipes (except the coconut omelettes) I cook up in batches and then freeze the rest so on later dinners I just pop them in the microwave and heat up. It helps make life a lot easier.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #BF0040\"><strong>Knowledge Without Experience Is Just Information ~ Mark Twain</strong></span></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Knowledge Without Experience Is Just Information ~ Mark Twain</div>'

A local hospital lab ran the tests and we had the results in 3 days. We had him tested for Giardia, yeast as well. Family doctor actually thought that Giardia may have been the problem even though he tested negative for it. Treatment for Giardia is Flagyl as well.    BH is very hard to get rid of. I am planning on continuing grapefruit seed extract for a couple of months after Flagyl. We may ask to retest, just to be sure.     I did notice that my son\'s anxiety was higher as well. He begged to sleep in our bed. We actually let him. But it was for a totally different reason. We painted his closet prior to him getting sick and were thinking that the fumes were causing his sickness at night. Well, he slept in our bed for several nights and still kept getting sick.

After that, he developed migraines, that got so bad they were continuous.  He lays in his room all day, can\'t go to school, just a mess.  They went to MANY doctors, and were finally referred to a psychiatrist (!).  They have done it all--lots of alternative stuff, foot baths, great diet, many supplements, on an on, without anything making a dent.  At the end of last year, they drove to Philadelphia to get an IV of vitamin C.  He was pain-free for several hours, for the first time in years.  They were unable to get another for maybe 2 months--not sure why.  But it is the only thing that has ever made a difference.    So, I know he has an imbedded infection....so do many of our kids.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I think it\'s good that you are seeing that much more mercury coming out than before using the NDF PLUS.  I can\'t say if it\'s a good pull because I don\'t know if he\'s been pulling that much or more all along.  Or how toxic he is/was.  It appears that your child is able to excrete more now than prior to NDF Plus.  I think we have to base most of the \"is it working\" on the child\'s response rather than the actual numbers we are seeing in the tests.  Though they are very helpful in getting us to know if we are on the right track.    I would recommend testing your child\'s first morning urine pH.  IF it\'s above 5.8-6.2, I would highly recommend adding in Liver Life.   This should allow your child to excrete even more without aggravations.  You should be able to ramp the dose of NDF PLUS a bit quicker as well.  The more you are able to give (without aggravations), the deeper the detox, the better the results.     LEt me know what you see if you do test the pH.  I\'m very curious to know.      Can you sign this under a certain name, description so I can look for your posts and updates.

' <div class=\"postbody\">i<div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"> dont know what else to do. he is testing fine for ph so i dont believe liverlife is needed for him </div> Just so you know the pH is only 1 of many things the Liver Life helps with.  Are you familiar with Th1 and Th2?    Here\'s a really interesting piece of info <span style=\"color: green\"><strong>Resistance to infections is a Th1 immune system response as the cells activate macrophage and neutrophils to deal with the infections.  If Th2 response is dominant, you cannot fight infections as the Th1 immune response is inhibited.</strong></span>  Clinical studies have established that medicinal mushrooms are able to rebalance the TH1 and TH2 immune states, modulating the immune system.   And here... <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">http://www.anapsid.org/cnd/diagnosis/cheneyis.html  Th0 are the naive cells of the immune system. They are resting, just waiting for an invader. When infection occurs, they convert to either Th1 or Th2, depending on the type of threat. When the resting cell is exposed to a virus, cancer, yeast, or intracellular bacteria (like mycoplasma or chlamydia pneumonia), the Th1 response is initiated. (The weapons of the Th1 system include cytotoxic T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells.   On the other side are normal bacteria, parasites, toxins, and allergens. These trigger a predominately Th2 response. Its weapons include eosinophiles (Eos), polymononuclear cells (PMN), and antibody secreting cells (Ab).   How does the naive cell know which pathway to take? It depends on the cytokine information received. The presence of any organism from the left side triggers production of a cytokine called Interleukin 12. IL-12 causes the Th0 cell to move down the Th1 path. On the other hand, organisms on the right side trigger the production of Interleukin 10 (IL-10), which causes the Th0 cell to move down the Th2 path.   Viruses, especially herpes viruses like EBV, CMV and HHV6, make proteins that mimic IL-10. The virus deceives the immune system into thinking that the threat is coming from the opposite side! So the immune system shifts from the Th1 mode that attacks viruses to the Th2 mode that does not. The virus increases its chances of survival by diverting the immune system. It is now thought that many, if not most, pathogens have this ability.  </div>  Though chelation, for my son, was his biggest piece of the puzzle, I think regulating the immune system, restoring liver function, establishing a healthy gut, dealing with virals, parasites, chemicals, yeast and bacteria are very important as well.    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">and have not been at chelation long enough to want to switch to IV or even DMPS or DMSA but i am worried that this is it even with the chelation he will forever be functioning at this level and i just dont think i can handle that.</div>  My personal feeling is, if you are not noticing improvement, it\'s time to make a change to the protocol.  If progress stops for a short while, I think that\'s to go with the territory, but to get no progress for a longer period of time, I\'d opt for a revamping of my son\'s protocol. <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">i have hoped and fought for so long and i hate to be so ungrateful for gains he has made but i want more for him. </div> This doesn\'t mean you are ungrateful by any means.  You are happy he\'s better, you just want it to continue.    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">he is 8, potty trained, can speak though rarely chooses to, is ocd, is resistant to change, has echolallia(sp?), loves swimming movies and music and most recently ninetendo, will visually and verbally stim, for sure motor planning difficulties, fine and gross motor deficeits, rarely plays with toys, sensory issues, presents some aggression when overwhelmed or pushed too much.</div> If he\'s got OCD, maybe look into things that can increase serotonin. This is my current focus right now.  OCD is often the result of low serotonin.  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">gains he has made, likes to be praised, interacts with his brother, finally eating a variety of food, does not spin self and objects at all anymore, is now affectionate, greets and says goodbye appropriately, can be talked out of being upset or when things are not his way, comprehension and understanding is enormous gains</div>  Those are wonderful gains!!!  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">and im sure there are more i am just wondering why this process is sooooo slowwww?</div> It may be harder for you cause you have two boys to compare.   There are some kids who do take longer to respond than others.  I know there are many different reasons for that.  I wish it were easier.  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">perhaps the kids who are getting better functioning and having minimal difficulties from asd are those with only one problem with the vaccines and ours who are still a mystery and a puzzle are the ones who have all the problems associated and if this is the case will they ever recover? </div> Well that\'s a very plausible theory and if it\'s true remember that it\'s still not impossible.

We just had the greatest conference on Thursday - Brandon\'s teachers say he is now referring to himself as &quot;I&quot; when talking and he is going up to kids in the classroom and on the playground regularly to talk to them (some of it still can\'t be understood).  The teacher said about a week ago he was asked to stop his work and go to speech and he stopped immediately, packed up his things and put them away and went down the hall to speech. He looked in the door and there was another student in there and he was standing by the door as the teacher walked by and said to her, &quot;It\'s okay, I just waiting&quot; and did the sign for waiting. She said she smiled and walked past and was tearing up because she\'d never heard him say something like that or be so independent before. He has always been considered &quot;nonverbal&quot; by the school, I can\'t believe this is probably going to change this year!  At home, he is starting to answer you when you ask him things - even in a typical way, like &quot;mm-hmm&quot; for yes and saying other answers too. So the new language appears to be more than just words, because he has a new social presence too!  I thought I\'d tried EVERY protocol there was for speech, and we are FINALLY seeing results with this combination!! So I am sharing so that maybe someone else can try it and see if it works for their child. I\'m going to post this on my other groups, so if you see it again, you know it\'s the same thing.

And of course there is nothing I ever gave him I didnâ€™t test on myself.   From the best of my knowledge I donâ€™t have HM toxistity, however for future heath risks, I have decided to detox my body anyway. (Can only help)  Just like a healthy diet fasting, plenty of exercise , along with ,colon and liver cleanses. All these can only help the body revitalize to its maximum potential    Personally As of a month ago I have done over a 100 rounds of chelation.  What I wanted to share was how I have learned to listen to my Body if I knew I needed to adjust something. Same goes for my child.  Example To add minerals, antioxidants, probiotics and yes even look at the stool. Im from the old school when cars had carburetors  (maybe a man may relate to this example) but the best way to see the way an engine is running is look at the spark plugs .IMO learning the Dana method  (that some folks here have put down) will be your best tool you have in treating your child.  This is not guess work.   IMO if you learn to listen to your body it will tell you what you need to add change and or adjust. The AC protocol is the safest method of chelation if you do it correctly.  And yes the hard part is the dosing schedule. Just like any other thing that may be beneficial. Proper commitment is always  a key to see results.  But of course they donâ€™t t come over night. Chelation and detox is a process.   Often times itâ€™s a change in lifestyle  JMHO its is just as hard as someone who greatly out of shape always sick on a bunch of meds They will not be well until they are committed to do the right thing for a while and it may not be convenient.   IMO thatâ€™s the way they got overweight ,sick with a bunch of medical conditions in the first place   Hope that helps .This reminded me of a good article and comments .I recently read from Dr Mercolaâ€™s newsletter.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thanks so much for the information.    My son just turned 13.  He\'s verbal, but often switches words, ex:  calls a muffin-cupcake, calls glue-ink (happens a lot-common).  Often he won\'t \"hear\" what you\'ve asked him in that he\'ll respond with an answer which doesn\'t match your question, although similar.  Ex:  I ask:  Did ___ pass out candies with his valentines?  He says: Yes, ____ got a lot of valentines.  So there\'s a disconnect which can be it highly frustrating for me.  He\'s not aware that he does this.  (a lot).  Also he has trouble with school-work.  Very slow at producing the homework requirements, as well as trouble in other areas regarding school.    I was thinking of trying this, as he needs help with communication/cognition.  Now I\'m more hesitant as I hear that the side-effects are pretty certain.      He just began mb 12 two wks ago.  I was so HOPING he\'d be a responder to it.  So far I\'ve seen no difference.  Maybe it\'s too soon to tell.  If mb 12 helped him--it\'s supposed to help in this same area--then I\'d not do the memantine for sure.  So far I\'m not seeing a difference.    Now I feel scared about trying the memantine because of the side-effects.      He\'s in a different place than your son, as he IS verbal.  Yet--he DOES have great need of communication/cognition help &amp; improvement.  I can\'t imagine his future in relationships.  He\'d drive a wife CRAZY (not being able to respond to a question appropriately, for ex.)!!--He could be an engineer, so career-wise he\'d be fine.  His main focus is computer, computer, computer.  He\'s a whiz with all that stuff.  But as far as relationships in the far, yet near future...  Also getting thru school--high school--how will he do all the language related stuff, essays....    Thank you for sharing information on this.  I was scared about it at first when I thought I saw it was a prescription DRUG.  But then--I thought--he needs help in his brain.  Maybe it\'ll help him, making it worth it to take this for him, despite it being a drug.  Now I\'m worried regarding side-effects.  As he\'s older, he\'d be more aware of them, plus he has to go to school, rather than still being a pre-schooler where we could get thru the time before side-effects diminished.    Thanks.

' <div class=\"postbody\">This might be out there, but...  We are doing a round of diflucan right now, and are seeing regression.  My DAN thinks it\'s a strep flare.  Kill off the yeast, the bacteria grows in the &quot;space&quot; that\'s left.  I mention this because I think we have done the same three times here in the winter.  I am seriously wondering why this seems to be a pattern--could strep be a bigger problem in the winter, maybe because of no sun and so little outside play?    Anyway, could there be something like this rearing its ugly head?  We are seeing OCD and anxious behavior from the strep.  I am actually going to call my DAN to see if we should soldier through the round (a full month, and we are still ramping up to full dose) or pull back and do something different.  Edited to add:  We have been working with JeniB\'s &quot;bean diet&quot; and while we cannot eat the beans several times a day, as suggested, we HAVE been able to take soluble fiber (Walgreen\'s version of Metamucil in capsules) several times a day for my kids and me.  It is having a great effect in many ways.  One that I\'m seeing is that it\'s keeping yeast at bay.  The &quot;mold people&quot; say that psyllium soaks up toxins, sort of like activated charcoal, and it is a daily staple for people who are doing toxic mold detox programs.  My kids like to drink the &quot;Tang&quot; flavored kind (sugar-free orange flavor) while my oldest and I swallow two capsules three times a day.  After all these years, I\'m surprised at how much of a good difference something so simple is making for us.  And it\'s natural, so maybe it would not be a problem to add it with homeopathy.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

When we went to 500 mg, we started getting defiant behavior that some have reported, but this went away when we went back to the 250 mg. dose. But what worked for us may not work for you.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Some call it pre-verbal or emerging speech as opposed to non-verbal.    I think children who are &quot;non verbal&quot; in the common use of the phrase are those who don\'t yet have any spoken words, not even scripting or echolalia that they can use functionally.   They might be able to babble, but they don\'t say words or repeat words.   A lot of people use the word &quot;verbal&quot; when what they mean is &quot;vocal&quot;.  We do Verbal Behavior ABA and my child is verbal - she can talk in functional sentences.  However, our analyst says that even children who communicate primarily through sign language or an augmented communication device are considered &quot;verbal&quot; because they are fluent in using those tools to express their innermost thoughts.  They\'re using those tools for functional communication and that\'s what being verbal means.  People who are hard of hearing and who sign consider themselves &quot;verbal&quot; even if they aren\'t vocal.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #800000\">There are many paths to autism.

Can I add baking powder/soda to the bananna pancakes? He hates eggs, so that is why he wont eat them.    I just ordered a legal sac b, acillidophilus, houston peptizyde yogurt maker and starter.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello,  My son is 4y 1m.  He was DX on April 1, 09 after a 45 min assssment with a Ps.  Her exact response to me was he has Austim yea I think that is right.  HFA that will look like Aspergers in the future.  He will need to be retested in a year.  My son did not show any signs of Autism until he was 26months old.  When he just did not want to be around other people and it has gotten worse.  My favorite picture of him is him sitting with the Easter bunny staring straight at the camera with a huge smile on his face.  We had started Biomed TX before the DX because like all of us we knew something was different.    We did a OAT test and he has High Yeast and a few other high markers that our DAN says is because of yeast.  We did a stool sample 1 month later and it showed again high yeast and high bacteria which was not on the OAT test.   I guess that shows you how fast it grows.     My question is how do you know that your son has allergies or high histimines or metals or a low immune system.  My son has a chronic runny nose which stopped after I removed casien and increased Vit C.  He has bad ezcema which he had since birth.  It has gotten better with the biomed TX.  I  am sorry that this is so long, but I gave a history in case any of you really intelligent people can help me.  Thank you..    Take Care   Stacy</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Mary,    Yes, we already started the diet, and yes we have seen gains. However, unless I see regression when stopping it, I\'m worried that I won\'t know for sure that the diet is what has \"caused\" the gains and progress.  Part of me wants to know, simply for the sake of truth, and part of me wants to know as a matter of pride.  The EI team that I am dealing with seems skeptical about the fact that the diet is what has made the difference.  Speaking of pride, I think they would prefer to take the credit themselves.  However, the services I have received for my son to date have been minimal, and the real gains just-so-happened to become evident after changing his diet.  So the short answer to your question <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\" /> is that I want to experiment with reindroducing milk to see if it has a negative affect.  Some suggest waiting, but my thought is that it is better to find out now rather than later.  Just wondering if anyone else has any compelling evidence to the contrary.</div>'

The mutation will not allow the folate to turn into the active methyl form, namely 5-methyltetrahydrofolate which interacts with MB12.  For this, you may have to supplement 5-MTHF.    <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylcobalamin\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylcobalamin</a><!-- m -->  This is also another interesting link covering the MTHFr mutations: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenet ... _reductase</a><!-- m -->   .....after reading this, look at the end for further suggested reading on dietary recommendations.  As for the heterozygous status concerning COMT, Rockhopper is correct that your child might not be able to tolerate too much methyl donors because of an innate tendency to have dopamine fluxes and thus, mood swings.  Hydroxycobalamin, Cyanocobalamin and Adenosylcobalamin may be acceptable forms of b12.    Hope this Helps!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hey Yall. I could use some advice.  My son has been on Valtrex for months at 250mg 3x/day. We really never saw any regression or gains. Because of our DAN\'s ego(IMO) and lack of familiarity with the Valtrex protocol, she would only agree to Amphotericin B daily, which she then weeks later asked \"Why are you on Ampho B?\".  What we did see was a struggle with yeast and a strange clear/white tiny bump rash that we\'ve never been able to get rid of. Ketaconizole cream had no effect.   We\'ve since, at the DAN\'s recommendation(since she coudn\'t recall stubbornly only being willing to go with Ampho B daily), switched to rotating Diflucan, Ketaconizole, naturals and Ampho B. Needless to say, we can only go about a week or so on naturals before getting \"yeasted up\". We just got a refill of Ampho B because we are \"yeasted up\" again.  On 12/1, I increased his dose to 250mg 4x/day. So far we don\'t see any difference. I am seriously considering whether we should drop Valtrex after another month if we don\'t see a breakthrough.  I just ordered charcoal for the first time.    How much charcoal do you folks use and when do you give it?  Have you seen and dealt with a rash like this one?  What kind of diet are you using? Since my son can\'t have eggs, SCD appears to be a bad option.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Parent of  7 YO PDD-NOS 5 YO NT</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Parent of  7 YO PDD-NOS 5 YO NT</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Since you hadn\'t gotten an answer, I wanted to say that we have battled yeast as our biggest issue for five years now.  Biomed and diet were not as well understood then, but we did not know that yeast was something that was THAT hard to beat.      Candida is a very, very hard thing to eradicate.  That\'s why the low oxalate diet is so interesting to many doctors--there is a theory that the yeast is trapped in oxalate crystals in tissues, and is released periodically to reinfect the host.  They aren\'t sure, though; what they are sure of is that yeast is a tough thing to get rid of, and they are not sure why.    Many have had success with Primal Defense (has a different breed of organisms to fight yeast than the usual) and some other probiotics and antifungals, but the reality is that, if you have a bad yeast problem, you will probably have to address it with diet and yeast-fighters for a very long time.  If you have continual backsliding, then I suspect it would be wise to investigate things like the BED and such.    It is my opinion, after over five years of doing this, that you should consider doing the SCD WITH the yogurt.  We did the SCD on and off for 1 1/2 years without it, but with large doses of other probiotics, and never reestablished the good colonies of bacteria.  A waste of a lot of time, in many ways. I have come to believe that the yogurt is necessary.    Just my opinions.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">oh, yeah. you betcha. there needs to be an ND in every town with one!  barbara ketover said it took her about six years of practice to be able to get reliable (i assume reproducible) readings. she said a lot of people come out of a quick training course as &quot;certified&quot; but that doesn\'t mean they are really qualified to use it. there is the aspect of being able to physically locate the meridian points and use the correct pressure, etc. and then there is the aspect of, based on the intake information and other information, being able to choose which of thousands and thousands of triggers to test. you have to know where to look for what you\'re looking for. but they had a pretty good system of testing a larger file folder (say parasites). if it tests positive, then look at parasites A-E, if that tests positive then look within that folder. sounds simplistic but it\'s based somehow on frequencies and for me the proof is really in my daughter\'s stools and food tolerances.  we are doing OK testing less frequently. it\'s definitely not ideal but it\'s still working. i would love it if we could go there every two weeks but obviously not feasible.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Learning to jiggle when shaken.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Learning to jiggle when shaken.</div>'

This is one way that the Liver Life helps.  I\'m really glad to hear your little one is not experiencing any negatives from chelation. Is he experiencing any positives?    I meant to add more to my previous reply but got side tracked. Tums doesn\'t help in preparing for chelation as it just neutralizes the stomach acids (and contains aluminum which contributes to the toxicity), it doesn\'t help to decongest the liver/kidneys and/or balance pHase I and II liver detox pathways which is one of the reasons LL is so helpful in preparing for detox.    Nella,  I personally feel that IV\'s are something that should be worked up to. SO if given the choice between IV or suppositories, I\'d do the suppositories first and see how those are tolerated.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Sugars help things ferment better.  Lots of carrot or squash in our fermented veggies work well for us.    My DS was only on broth and meat for the first couple days.  We slowy added veggies one at a time as per what we usually eat (spinach, carrots, green beans) and what his (new at the time) food allergy test did not show reaction to.  This actually left us pretty limited, as I understand is often the case when you start rotating foods for tolerance.  Then we slowly added fruit, one by one, again based on what we usually eat starting with banana.  We held off on nuts or almond/pecan flour (I ground my own, such a tedious task) until eight weeks in.  By that time his stools were normal and there was no more yeast rash.  Once we started the muffins, he liked them so much he would sneak and get them and was eating primarily almond and/or pecan flour muffins.  He became severely constipated doing this and was in great pain.  After we got him cleared we imposed a no-more-than-once-a-day rule.    That\'s what WE did.  That\'s what works for us.  He does not now have a yeast problem and his stools are formed and the same, at the same time every day.

The booklet or documentation should have given you a prioritization of which SNP\'s to work on first. If you have a CBS defect, you might start treating it first. Also, I would determine whether your defects show whether your child should remove methyl donors or encourage methyl donors. Have you done stage one yet? What are your results?

Problems with Sulfa Family Residue (all the detox systems, problems with liver detoxing so we stimulated the liver to detox), he also showed he was storing toxins in the brain.    Problems with Pertussis, Diptheria, and fungal toxins (large bowel)    Problems with Smallpox (yes, smallpox), cadmium, Rubella, and Dental Chord (which is true, his jaw is misaligned)    We didn\'t get the MMR, but what I have a feeling is happening, our generation that got the MMR first, grow out of their immunity to a part of this vaccine, mainly Rubella, and get it when pregnant. We don\'t show symptoms of it and causing problems with some at birth (my guy has always had the staring thing, but was always very social (except when he regressed this spring). He also began having muscle weakness around 2-3  months old.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I have been asking lots of diet questions lately - here\'s another one.  How long have you noticed withdrawal symptoms lasting?  We have been CF for almost 2 months.  We didn\'t notice any withdrawal symptoms but after about a month saw positives including the beginning of potty training.  We added in GF 10 days ago.  Trevor is accepting the foods, which is great, and we started seeing clearer speech after 4 days (could still be from the CF making the MB12 work better I guess).  However, now that we are also GF, we have been seeing diarrhea every other day and also a return of tough tantrums.  His behavior over the past few days has been very difficult for us to handle.  He just seems so full of rage and anger.  He has happy moments as well and some calm times, but if he doesn\'t get what he wants immediately, look out!  He has always been this way but the tantrums are lasting longer and he has added in hitting and spitting (throwing objects too, which he has done in the past).  He just seems very angry and we don\'t know how to handle it, especially with two other children to take care of as well.  Could these still be withdrawal symptoms after 10 days?  What withdrawal symptoms have you seen with your children and how long did they last?  I should also add that Trevor is on MB12, Dr N\'s vitamins/minerals, CLO, and probiotics (only the probiotics are also fairly new - within the last month or two).  We are looking to start Liver Life - I just need to find the time to actually order it...    Lisa</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I personally would try the zinc espically if you have it on hand.  Are you using anything with Zinc in it.  If so that might rule out the zinc.  If you have some on hand I would try you will know pretty fast if that is the problem.  Should not take much more then about an hour to tell.  My son had so many teeth pulled and was loosing his baby teeth that he stopped grinding his teeth and started clicking his tounge.  If I give him zinc he stops.  That would be a pretty clear indication Zinc is the culprit.  That being said you could test for parasites.  Or if you have a parasite killer on hand try that.  I happen to have both on had at all times. So for me it is pretty easy.  I also have the MannaBears so I can target him pretty fast.  I have stuff that I know works for him.  Zinc is not expensive but grinded up taste like c--- so if your child can swallow pills that could make it difficult.  Mine will take it crushed up but he is pretty good about taking all gross stuff.  He can\'t swallow pills so we do it the icky way.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">The GF/Cf diet was awful for my son, and we did it for a year. He was chronically constipated, and ate all those pre packaged Ktoos, chips, etc... it was killing his system. I thought this diet would eventually help, so I kept doing it. We also consistently treated him for yeast during this time, and it never went away. All of those sugars and carbs in those foods just fuled the yeast. Even though they were rice flours, they are still flour.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Aisha, my kid is 6 1/2 also, a total non-responder to all DAN protocol (I\'ve done all of it).  The 24hrs EEG and the MRI were actually prescribed by my out-of-state DAN, but I had the prescription re-written by a local pediatrician, so that the insurance and the hospital would accept it. The pediatrician wrote in the Dx. &quot;Suspicion of early morning seizures&quot; (even if we never actually had a seizure); I also always ask my insurance company for their Policy Bulletin for EEG and MRI, or other, so that I know in advance which diagnosis codes and which procedure codes will be covered according to my policy. I then ask the pediatrician to code accordingly. That way I do not have bad surprises when the bill comes, and I always get it covered. I did not have to pay for EEg nor MRI.   When I consulted with Dr. Miranda he also required the 24hrs EEG and the MRI (they need to be of a specific format), but as I already did them, he was happy to just have the actual tracing (very important) and interprete them himself. His comments were very different from the ones made by the hospital techinician, Dr. Miranda found many abnormalities, while the hospital found none.  It is important to do a 24 hrs EEG, because 80% of seizure activity happens at night, and no sedation or the results will be falsified. Any EEG shorter than 24hrs might not capture the seizure.  The DEEP-EEG is not medically necessary, it is a nice test to have to decide on drug intervention, I\'ll let you know what the insurance will respond, as well as the doctor.  TAke care</div>'

I cannot even remember the last time he has this many days with normal poop.  Today my husband left for work and he said - &quot;bye daddy I will miss you&quot;  He has never said I will miss you - EVER!!  This afternoon we went to the store.......here are some things he said..........there\'s a bunch of cars mom (looking at the cars in front of us), there are 2 houses (pointing at houses), he saw the sign for Target and said look at the sign - I asked him what it said and he said TARGET!,  then there was sort of a sentence about Manny from Ice Age and the baby Peaches and how they are elephants with long trunks - it didn\'t come out in a complete sentence but I knew exactly what he was trying to say!  Oh yeah and the other day I just remembered that he grabbed some celery sticks off of my husband\'s plate and ate it!  He never eats celery - not sure if this has anything to do with the Cytoflora.  And he asked to go to the House of Bounce (it\'s a place that has a bunch of those inflatable slides and stuff that kids can jump on and slide down, etc - we are in the northeast so it\'s nice for someplace to go in the winter time) and said that he has fun there.  All of these things are new words, new sentences.  It has to be from the Cytoflora.  Thanks to everyone here who posted about their success with it - without this site and this group of people I never even would have known to try it.  I think we are seeing some great stuff here.   I have a question however - I started the first day with 1 dropper - then went to 2 droppers twice/day - maybe I did that too quickly but I really did not see anything but good things from it.  I am still using 2 droppers twice/day.  Should I increase it?  When should I increase and by how much?

' <div class=\"postbody\">Except for the phlegm thing, this is what I go through with chronic fatigue, not as much now since I moved to a better diet.    However, we bought a used car and they detailed it before we took it home and it stuck so bad with some sort of fruit scented chemical spray that I was extremely extremely fatigued the whole night and very very agitated.  My hubby got a huge headache from it when he drove it later that night.   So my guess is it has to do with the bodies inability to process certain toxins of whatever kind.    Things that help me with chronic fatigue: all natural diet (as organic and free range a possible), low grains, raw sauerkraut, kelp, epsom salt orally (not enough to induce diarrhea), juicing fresh juice.  Lecithin gives me a brain buzz however since it feels like my brain is not fully on all the time (people with CF will most likely understand like mental tiredness), I use it sparingly, one cap every 2 days seems to be okay or it keeps me to awake.  High does of vitamin c used to be good for me, now if I take too much I get a sore throat- not sure why.

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">USDA APPROVES CHIP IMPLANTS THAT CAUSE CANCER TUMORS  Over the past couple of years, the OCA has reported on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS), a set of controversial, mandatory regulations the U.S. federal government claims to have abandoned to the states, but in fact is still pushing, specifically, in the 2007 Farm Bill. NAIS would require that all farmers and farm animal owners implant their animals with a computer chip, even those who just own a single cow, horse, chicken or other farm animal. Last week, the USDA approved the use of two new types of chips for the NAIS program. These same chips have already been planted in millions of pets and marketed to pet owners as an ID device to help find lost pets. Increasingly, these same chips are being marketed and implanted into humans. Evidence has now surfaced that a significant number of studies done in the 1990s revealed that lab animals implanted with the devices developed tumors. When the FDA approved the use of the chips for human implanting, these reports were never made public. In an interview with a retired toxicologic pathologist who studied the chips for Dow Chemical,\"The transponders were the cause of the tumors.\"  Learn more: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_7570.cfm\">http://www.organicconsumers.org/article ... e_7570.cfm</a><!-- m -->   ___________________________________   QUICK RELATED FACT:  WHO APPROVED TUMOR-CAUSING CHIPS? The FDA is overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services, which, at the time of the original RFID chip\'s approval, was headed by White House appointee Tommy Thompson. Two weeks after the device\'s approval took effect on Jan. 10, 2005, Thompson left his Cabinet post, and within five months was a board member of VeriChip Corporation, the company who designed the RFID chip. He was compensated by VeriChip with cash and stock options. In his public appearances, he continues to claim the chips are completely safe and urges all citizens get the implants for the sake of the health and safety of their families. To date, neither Thompson nor any member of his family has had the chip implanted.    </div></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #FF0040\"><strong> Save 5.00 on 1st order code VEG287</strong></span> http://www.iherb.com/  *Twins*</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________  Save 5.00 on 1st order code VEG287</div>'

Some say baby spinach isn\'t as bad as other greens but I still rotate just in case.  Like today we are doing romaine lettuce, tomorrow will be baby spinach and the next day I will give sunflower sprouts and buckwheat sprouts then maybe kale or collard greens then I will start the rotation again.  I also add  periodically carrots but they do contain sugar so be careful with yeast.  I also give celery which is great for the liver.  Potatoes are good for stomach ulcers if you juice a small amount of that but at the moment I have had to be very careful with the fruits because of yeast.   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /></div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Aisha, we got to full dose LDN (five lines) after about 10 days only, he was fine with it for about a month. But then he had an infection - don\'t know what it was, probably viral, but he had a VERY high fever, very lethargic and Winnie, this was followed by regression... I read of someone with similar experience, their fever and regression went away after they lowered LDN to half, so we did the same and it worked. We then worked our way back to full dose but two weeks later the same thing happend - again extremelly high fever, and regression that just would not go away. After day three I decided to lower the dose to three lines again that night and in the morning he was his smiley lovely self again...fever gone.    Since then we have tried upping the dose but as soon as we get to about 4 lines he gets very irritable and hard to handle. We just decided that since he did so well on 3 lines to leave it at that. I have since heard a few people noticed the same thing with their kids - fine with full dose for a while, then became very sensitive and did better with less... the important thing to find the right level but it is not that hard.    Re No.1 intervention if you asked me two months ago it would have been LDN but now I would say Inflammation Control. To be honest I think it is probably the combination of those two.
