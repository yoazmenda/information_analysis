I find they come out best on 375 for about 30-35 mins on a baking stone lined w/ parchment paper.  Sometimes I turn off the oven and leave them in for another few minutes to dry out and become crisper.  You can puree a squash for mashed potatoes (maybe mix in some ckn broth) or you can cook cauliflower and then put it in a food processor w/ some salt, maybe some garlic.  Comes out pretty similar to mashers.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to Rosie, 7yrs - ASD Long Island, NY</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to Rosie, 7yrs - ASD Long Island, NY</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello, I started my son on this 2 weeks ago it was the one for $48.  In 2 weeks my sons language has improved, socialization has improved and stools improved within 3 days to being fully solid and he is going 2 times a day and wanting to eat often which before he had very little appetite.  The improvements started immediately and have slowly built as the days have gone by.  All his therapists have been so excited about the improvements they are seeing in him.  His preschool teachers have come to me the last few times excited about his improvements also.  Everyone is noticing them in such a short period of time.  Now for the negatives.  My son reacts to everything and this is no exception I was giving 1/2 capsule 2 times a day and he was not sleeping well at night, sometimes getting up 7 or 8 times and constantly wanting to drink and having a bellyache.  I have decreased it to 1/2 capsule in the morning and now he is sleeping most of the night.  Even at this small dose there have been improvements.  When I increase to 3/4 capsule he gets a terrible belly ache and I have to back off.  This product is well worth the money I think.  I have seen just as much improvement with this as I did with the cytoflora, my son just couldn\'t handle the cytoflora.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Caringdad71 and thank you for replying to my question in such detail. I have read your reply many times and think I understand what you are saying and I have also read the two articles you sent the links for.    At present, I give my daughter 100mg of SAMe every three days in order to help her methylation - I do not give it to her more often as I am trying to avoid a build up of homocysteine as you refer to in your post. Before, I was giving her 150gm of SAMe every day and while we saw good gains at first, after a few weeks she was somehow off. I am trying to avoid this happening again while at the same time trying to balance the amount fo SAMe so it won\'t build up.    You write that later on I can give her methionine to help support the \'long way\' of methylation and you also suggest adding DMG. Do you mean to stop SAMe and just give methionine and DMG  or  to  give SAMe and DMG together while slowly phasing out the SAMe? My daughter\'s last  organic acid test showed she had higher HVA relative to VMA. It seems to me that methylation is a very tricky subject!!!</div>'

Then again we are finally getting more agressive and perhaps smarter about controlling the yeast and Clostridia now (so maybe it was the Sac-B, etc).    Our typical schedule (after ramp up) is as follows:    [School days]    6AM - one threelac + one sac-B    after school - one Culturelle plus one Primal Defense Ultra    9PM  - one threelac + one sac-B or Culturelle  [wake him up if needed so ~2-3 hours after meals and other supplements]     [non-School days]    6AM - one threelac + one sac-B    11AM - one Culturelle plus one Primal Defense Ultra    ~3-3:30PM or pre-Dinner by 1 hour - one threelac + one sac-B    late day - Culturelle plus whatever    The Threelac is a lemony powder that he\'s fine with, and would probably be easier for a kid that can\'t swallow pills.

For instance if the glutathione is low then the whole cycle of how these supplements absord into the body can be thrown off according to Dr. Cave. MB-2, Glutathione, Folinic acid, DMG they all work in a cycle. If you\'re low in one it may block another from working right in the body.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Fuzzyone,  Well, I had wondered in the past about possible diabetes, but she was tested and they said it was not a problem.  It is only recently that I\'ve been considering hypoglycemia.  But I had not tied the &quot;seizure&quot; stuff to that, but only to the fact that she seem to need to eat often, and needs protein.  so I\'m really, really glad you suggested this.  I just got the Bock book in the mail today and he talks about the fact that hypoglycemia is a big issue in the 4-A kids.    I have been letting my dd eat a lot more carbs lately as I\'ve been trying to get some weight on her; I haven\'t been balancing the carbs and protein like I did for years here.  I am wondering if this has lead to the mood swings--and the &quot;seizure&quot; stuff I mentioned.  She is responsive, but is shaking all over, with her teeth chattering.  She says she gets something she calls &quot;scary tummy&quot; before this begins.  I had really thought maybe parasites.  Now this is interesting--I have treated many times for parasites, and the first two treatments helped, but I feel the last couple have maybe made her worse. So I have not treated her recently.  I am wondering tonight if the Vermox, which damages the parasites\' ability to use sugars, does something bad to my dd\'s sugar metabolism as well.  Hmmmm.....  Also wondering tonight if WD\'s &quot;trick&quot; of protein at night to help his son sleep might be due to normalization of blood sugar.  For the rest of my family, carbs at night help for sleep, as suggested by Sidney Baker (that\'s where we got it from, anyway.)  Maybe protein for my dd at night might help.  She is also a sleepwalker, up about 1-2 hours after she goes to sleep.  Thank you again--your suggestion was at just the right time for me to &quot;get it.&quot;  I\'m betting this will be the ticket!

' <div class=\"postbody\">It is unlikely that the COQ10 itself caused any problems as it is very poorly absorbed in a dry form (i.e. requires a lipid).    The chewable tablet is pretty much useless unless it consumed with a fatty meal.  It is better to buy COQ10 in a soft-gel (and cut it open if he cannot swallow) or a liposomal formula.

' <div class=\"postbody\">We use 5-HTP in combination with GABA and Melatonin in the evenings.  I give about 25 mg of 5-HTP to my 30 pound son.  It helps him stay asleep once he gets asleep (that\'s where the melatonin comes in).  We have seen no negatives from this supplement.  It\'s usually recommended that you be giving a B6 supplement along with 5-HTP.  If you give a carbohydrate snack with it, it seems to be better absorbed as well.      The only side effect may be hyperactivity.  If you see that, you probably do not want to use this supplement (since it is having the opposite effect that you would want).  This supplement is basically used to produce tryptophan (the stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy).      I think if you are using any prescription drugs that affect seratonin, you might not want to mess with this supplement either (or stop the Rx drugs during the trial) -- as tryptophan also regulates seratonin.    We use Jarrow brand 5-HTP.  This has worked well for us.  We give GABA 3 x per day, 250 mg per dose.  We do not use the GABA with Inositol as higher doses of inositol caused problems for us.  He gets a very small amount of inositol in his multi (Kirkman\'s Spectrum Complete).  We use Solgar brand GABA.    Taurine is also a very good supplement to promote calmness.  We use about 250 mg per day (also Solgar).</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I had to sit (for hours!) and spoonfeed my son for two years until he was well enough to broaden his diet on his own.  We began biomed at age 4 and I was still feeding him his meals (much to my parents\' horror) when he was six.  But he was not able to make himself eat it on his own.  I mean, REALLY not able.  \"Letting him get hungry enough to eat\" did NOT do the trick--he was at a place where he truly would starve before he\'d eat, and looked like a concentration camp victim.    Maybe your son won\'t eat because he can\'t, like my son.  You might consider working on other things at the same time--zinc, supplements (see the Reliv post above) and a parasite treatment (pinworm medication from the drug store.)  THat might make him feel better and be able to eat.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

To be honest, I wish I could use it more, because from what I have seen with my kiddo, it definitely has helped him, has never hurt him, and seems to clear him up of <em>something</em> within hours.    The only reason why I haven\'t been able to use it consistently is believe it or not - his school. It makes you pee a lot and the urine smells a tad bit, well, like chlorella. They were questioning it, which really pissed me off. Of course, we have the same problem with authia. I put it on him at night, the next morning I wiped the skin area where I applied it to, and didn\'t smell a thing. Lo and behold, the school writes a note stating that the smell from his vitamin cream is making others sick (it looks to me like they want my son to remain autistic forever! I am beginning to hate them! With good reason!).    I actually really like NDF. Especially right after a round of chelation - it seems to literally clean up what is lying around, helps to prevent re-distribution.    I never told our DAN! that we are using it - I just simply use it - and plan to use it more!    Sorry for the long post - Good Luck!</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Interesting the connection with smells ... Hydrogen sulfide (the smell of rotten eggs, putrid water, etc) is quite toxic and REEKS. As long as you can smell it, you\'re OK. But if you STOP smelling it ... you are about to pass out!!!     I used to work with samples in a lab containing lots of hydrogen sulfide. It was bad enough smelling it, but I knew that if I stopped perceiving the stench, I had to get out of there in a hurry ... or be carried out in a stretcher.     Although from what Dana says, it is the opposite way with DMPS. Dana, you have trouble when you smell it? I wonder if the first batch of DMPS was going bad, and you were smelling a byproduct (more stinky) of the DMPS that was affecting you? I know that over time, glutathione (also a sulfur compound) smells more and more ... it is becoming oxidized and less effective. Possibly the same happens to DMPS?

You really have to give it a good five or six weeks without any changes to get your base line.    After the first couple of weeks just ensure that you are providing proper supplementation.  We follow Dr. N\'s protocol.    With us, we really didn\'t have too many negatives.  There were some very early morning awakenings and oral stims were crazy.    We\'ve been doing MB12 for well over a year now.  We even stepped up to daily but honestly I didn\'t see that much more in the way of positives.  Basically now we are at least every other day.    My feeling is that it\'s something that is still contributing to my sons recovery.  He is doing very well.    Greg</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">LnAmon, I think AC actually mentions using EDTA if you\'ve chelated for at least a year to make sure mercury is out-if you are sure there\'s no more mercury, he does have a schedule for it and dosing if necessary, I think he still doesn\'t like recommending it, but if lead is a big problem, you may look into it. Honestly, you may have to take a break from all chelation for a bit. If he\'s getting sick, netrophils may be down and that\'s not good. Being sick alot is a sign of this. DMSA does pull lead, I\'d even consider once you\'ve had a break for a while, using DMSA again but with modified citrus pectin. There\'s a study on it and it\'s very effective at pulling lead specifically. I use it here at the end of a round. It went on to say that 500% of lead was being dumped after 7 days on MCP <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" /> . Pretty impressive.   I won\'t lie and say that I\'m not a bit concerned about going on to use EDTA. If it\'s the stall or sickness that is preventing progress, maybe take a break and see if he starts to feel better this summer and start again after some good sun exposure and he\'s not around so many kids at school. I will also say that I think suppositories can be traumatic for some kids. I still remember my mom doing it for me when I was 3. Autistics have so many strange feelings around their bodies and putting this in as often as required for chelation can cause regression, imo. But, I look at that kind of stuff alot for treating my kid. We don\'t even draw blood anymore.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Diane,  I just changed the twins to daybed style in their cribs with one of the sides gone and replaced it with a toddler bed siderail.  My girls also share a room and will wake the other one up if fussing etc.  My girls have also been good sleepers all along...and really nothing has messed with that much.  They now can get out of their beds and therefore have basically eliminated their naps except for about every 4th day.  They are still sleeping at night, but are very tired (maybe over tired)and sometimes wake up talking or slight fussing.  If your twins\' sleep issues are not due to the LDN...it could be the phasing out of naps or nightmares.  My older 4 all went through a nightmare or scared wakings at night around 3 years old...and they were not exposed to anything but videos I chose.  I think it is a normal phase for some kids especially when their imagination kicks in etc.  It could be normal.    On the other hand...I don\'t know what the half life of the LDN is...we are going to be starting it within the next several weeks or month.  But I understood it to affect the Circadian rhythms and I wonder if it could still affect the sleep/wake cycle after the med was no longer given for a while.  I really don\'t know.  I think it would be good to figure out though.  Maybe after the sleep issues subside - then I would try to reintroduce the LDN in tiny doses and if the same sleep issues occur...you have found your answer.  Hopefully as very tiny dose will give good results without many side effects...this stuff sure seems to be hard to regulate at first.    I know exactly what you mean about keeping the twins straight.  I actually have a chart that is in a 2 inch binder that has tabs for meds/supps, stools, food diaries, behavior changes etc...and I have to check off things as they happen or I give them - I made the charts on a spread sheet with the help of my friend...because if I had to write every single thing down everyday, I would go even loonier than I already am!!  You might want to try something like that.  For so long the girls were on the exact same things, but not really anymore...atleast not the same doses etc...so I have to keep it all straight!!!

Just start out gradually with 1 drop, then increase to 1 drop 3 times a day, then 2 drops 3 times a day - gradually increasing the doze.  Monitor your child\'s reaction.  Make sure you give NCD separate from vitamins and minerals. It can by put into liquid or food - doesn\'t have a taste or smell.  Very easy to use.  A doctor would usually order a Urine toxic metals test both pre and post-NCD, just to see how much metals it pulls out.  You can order this test yourself with Direct Laboratory Services.

He says that we need to take in higher levels like the Japanese.  These are high doses for instance the WHO recommends 1mg and from what I\'ve read Japanese women take in 12.5mg/day and have less breast &amp; uterine cancer.  I don\'t know if I can post his website for you to look at or not.  Anyways my research on iodine indicates that it chelates mercury, kills yeast and bacterias, stores in the body and bumps the junk out of the way so it can store its self there.  Iodine has also been associated with intelligence.  Everything I\'ve read says to be careful supplementing kids with Iodine.  Does anyone know why that is or have any experience in this area?  Of course he recommends thryoid monitoring and testing during use.  I\'m just wondering because the side effects of chelation sound scary, but this he\'s used with a lot of success in adults.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Jen78fl,  I\'ve always been been awed and amazed by your dedication, perserverance, and willingness to try new things.  I remember how scared I was that my son talk much and being so frightened by the people who said if he didn\'t have therapy by age three and didn\'t talk by age five.......     I think they are often very wrong and there isn\'t a window or door that slams shut at five.  My son\'s progress didn\'t really start until 3 1/2 and really only took off between 4 1/2 and 5.    One of the kids at my son\'s preschool uses PECS sometimes, but he does talk.  When I was talking to his mom about how cool the PECS were, she said he didn\'t say a word or make  a sound until he was four.  He\'s five and he\'s enrolled in a regular preschool now.  It\'s going pretty well from what I can see.  I\'ll find out tommorow since he is coming to my house for a play date with S.    Have you tried PECS or sign language?  I also was going to suggest Leap Frog and baby bumble bee videos.    Liz</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Rosiemom - so great to hear you\'re seeing good things from working with Mary Coyle. I think she\'s very well respected within the homeopathic community. She hosted her own show on Autism One for about a year I think. Anyone interested in listening to those archived shows should be able to do so by googling her name along with Autism One. I listened to all of her shows as well as Amy Lansky\'s when I was first thinking about homeopathy. She (Mary C.) had Cindy Griffin and Lindyl Lanham from HCH as guests on one hour where they discussed homotoxicology and sequential therapy. I\'ll see if I can\'t find that link and post it here. Very informative for those interested in learning more about homeopathy.  HCH uses homotoxicology to detox as well. I think they use different products than Mary does but they are both attempting to go about opening the detox pathways and strengthen the immune system. Her story regarding recovering her son is an inspirational one. I believe he was pretty severe at 5 years old before she started working with Greg Ellis from PA to detox him. I think she\'s taken what Ellis did (over ten years ago at this point) modified it a bit, and came up with her own method. I looked at her website and wasn\'t aware she did sequential therapy as well. Aisha - she may be a better resource for you than HCH given the cost factor and that you need help with two children. Rosiemom - will she eventually work with you in clearing vaccines?   FYI to all: there is a European homeopath by the name of Tinus Smits who has been using sequential therapy with autistic kids for awhile now. He has been training homeopaths throughout Europe and a few in the United States I believe on his CEASE (Complete Eradication of Autistic Symptom Expression) method. Here is an interesting interview where he discusses his work:  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.hpathy.com/interviews/tinus-smits.asp\">http://www.hpathy.com/interviews/tinus-smits.asp</a><!-- m --> and here is his website where you can read more about him as well as case studies of autistic kids: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.tinussmits.com/3847/about-dr.-smits.aspx\">http://www.tinussmits.com/3847/about-dr.-smits.aspx</a><!-- m --> Exciting stuff for sure!! Looks like he mixes some classical homeopathy in with sequential. Whatever works to make kids better from this scourge!  Homeopathy Center of Houston is cost prohibitive for many but there are others who do what they do. One just has to investigate and get referrals, etc.   For those wanting to know more about HCH, I received permission from a mom currently working with HCH since the spring to post a link to her son\'s recovery blog:  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://drewsautismdiary.blogspot.com/\">http://drewsautismdiary.blogspot.com/</a><!-- m -->  Joanna does a great job in explaining the HCH protocol (check out her archives) and her son\'s reactions as he goes through the clearing process. Her son is a doll baby and he\'s really doing great! He\'s gone from non-verbal to 40 words in a matter of months. Hope those of you interested find it informative.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ ******************************** Mom to recovering ASD boy - 5yrs</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ ******************************** Mom to recovering ASD boy - 5yrs</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Our son is having horrible allergy symptoms already!    We have seen a pattern of regression every spring/early summer for the last two years.  I am talking BIG regression where he stops talking, loses all focus, wants do nothing but rip leaves, and tantrums/aggressive behaviors like biting.    His nose is bothering him so much, and he is getting extremely agitated.    We are about to get our 4th LDA shot and are hoping to eventually erradicate this problem, but it is obviously not helping yet.    We also started 1 line of LDN recently.  I know that sometimes this can bring viruses out, but the only symptom my son has is a stuffy nose, and my sinuses have been bad as well.    Zyrtec did NOTHING to help him yesterday, and we have had no luck with OTC meds for him like Benadryl.    Does anyone have suggestions for how to help him?  We cannot even teach the poor kid how to blow his nose!    He has been progressing rapidly with HBOT, MB-12, Zeolite, the supplements on Dr. Neubrander\'s supplement review form, and a new VB program...he is more \"with us\" than ever, talking more than ever, and he is even playing independently and initiating \"chase\" games with his little brother.    We know that HBOT will help with inflammation in the brain from the histamines, but his sinuses were so bad last night, we were afraid to put him in there!    I do not want him to have ANOTHER big regression, and I am afraid that is where we will be heading if we do not find something NOW to get this under control.    Thanks in advance for any advice you have to help us to be procative!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ M.S.    \"I will leave no stones unturned to help my son reach his potential.\"</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ M.S.    \"I will leave no stones unturned to help my son reach his potential.\"</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Thank you both for your responses. I really appreciate it. What is CLO?   I took him for our neighbors son\'s birthday party today evening (just after few hours ) and he behaved fine there. I was so nervous about taking him there but he is totally fine. Our neighbor\'s son is one year younger than my son. He is gentle with another boy who is 10 months old. Even when the 10 month old boy tried to tap my son\'s cheeks he did not react badly. Kari, your thought is good, he might be getting better with his receptive language because he hit the same birthday boy yesterday when they are playing outside when the other kid tried to take his car. Before he used to just give his toys to this other boy if he wants to take it. We have an IEP in place, they recommended ST, OT and PE for him. We are moving to another state in few weeks and the new state is going to consider our current IEP. Even though school district classified my son as moderately autistic, the children center in our city dismissed it and they diagnosed it as Mixed Receptive Expressive Language Disorder. I am going to get him checked again in NYC once we move there for the second opinion. If Multi are improving his receptive language is it advisable to stop them and see? If I continue and if he becomes violet then the new school might put him in a restrictive environment. If I stop this multi should I try another brand\'s multi. Please advise.Thank you for your time.</div>'

Prior to starting chelation, our DAN doctor sent us the Autism Research Institute\'s consensus paper on detoxification for us to read.      If you look at page 17 of the paper, which I\'ve linked below, it says, under the section labeled Mineral Supplementation, that \" Because of poor nutrition (often due to idiosyncratic food preferences), poor absorption, and other, poorly understood factors, autistic children usually have numerous mineral deficiencies. Chief among these deficiencies is zinc. Zinc supplements should be given prior to, during and after detoxification therapy.\"    Here\'s the consensus paper on detoxification.   <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.autismwebsite.com/ari/vaccine/heavymetals.pdf\">http://www.autismwebsite.com/ari/vaccin ... metals.pdf</a><!-- m --></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #800000\">There are many paths to autism.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi,  1mg of p5p = 5 mg of regular vit B6.  Therefore, p5p being the active metabolite of pyrodoxine is 5 times more powerful.   B6/p5p has many diversified roles including serving as a coenzyme for neurotransmitter synthesis like serotonin, epinephrine and GABA to name a few.  Specifically, b6 is required for the transformation of tryptophan to serotonin and later eventually downstream, to niacin (vit B3).  Some of the serotonin is \'saved\' and when it is methylated, some melatonin is produced by our pineal glands.  Melatonin is a hormone that regulates our body clock in that it sets our sleep cycle.  It also serves as an antioxidant.  You may wish to add in some more magnesium steadily to help relaxation as well as cooperative work with the b6.  Additionally, you may consider lowering the dose of p5p.  Finally, you may try administering it at breakfast in the morning.  The b vitamins in general can be energizers and thus, cause alertness/wakefulness, vitamin b6 being no exception.  Furthermore, excessive b6 can enhance neurotoxicity (common problem in ASD kids), since it drives the transformation of kynurenate(normally calming) to quinolinate (excitatory).  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolinic_acid\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolinic_acid</a><!-- m -->  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KP_pathway.jpg\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KP_pathway.jpg</a><!-- m -->  (diagram)  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kynurenine_pathway\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kynurenine_pathway</a><!-- m -->  If you have your child\'s recent OAT test, check to see the levels of kynurenic acid and quinolinic acid to see if they are in range.

He was doing good when you saw him before but now it seems like he\'s just sailing through life.  Nothing bothers him anymore. He still doesn\'t like to be told he can\'t play his playstation, but I doubt any kid would like that.    He was in the bathroom today and we had just bought a generic brand of toilet paper that I had never bought before.  He said, \"Mom, this is Tempo.\" (Brand of toilet paper) I am so amazed at how he can figure out pretty much any word now. And he has so much fun doing it.     Oh and two days ago we were driving home at about 9pm at night. So it was really dark. And him and his sister started making up stories.  His sister said, \"We are falling from the sky.\" Then he said, \"And we have parachutes.  There\'s one, two, three parachute.\"  (Three of us in the car.)  Then I said, \"Oh no, we hit a bird.\"  Then Gavin said, \"Watch out we only have two parachutes now.\"  THen my daughter said that we were landing in the ocean on a ship.  Then Gavin says, \"And we are going down now in a submarine.\"  It was amazing how they both were just pretending to do these things together.  I don\'t know if life gets better than this.   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />  But I look forward to the new ideas he is sharing each day!

I also have the option of switching to hardshell hBOT but that\'s available only at 1.5 ATA 100%oxygen. I\'ve noticed that when I do 5 days at a stretch i see very good gains.

I am soooo sad to hear your response.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" />  I have relied on your advise many, many times. (Since I am not divulging my identity, I know you can\'t really understand how much so). Please don\'t take this as an attach, because it certainly is not meant that way, but I am truly flabbergasted that someone of your obvious intelligence would buy into this treatment. I too have read the testimonies of the people who claim that NAET worked, and I can only say that I believe that they were either brainwashed or fools themselves. I know that the mind has a tremendous amount of influence over the body, but come on! Please tell me that you do not truly believe that a person can tell you your personal allergies just by having you hold a vial containing that substance and then pulling on the other arm to test for weakness? I do understand how accupuncture works and I wouldn\'t disregard its effect on pain. But the whole idea of performing accupuncture/accupressure on someone while they look at the offending substance.........??????? I am sorry, but there is no way that I can swallow that. It defies all logic. Besides, the lady that came up with this method claimed that she cured herself of allergic reactions to Vitamins B, C, and A.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" /> Does anyone really buy that a person can be allergic to essential vitamins? Yes, a person may be unable to tolerate high doses, but again.... Come on!  I can\'t even get into the surrogate testing. There\'s not enough time in this day to express my complete opinion on that subject. I guess if you believe in this treatment, I can\'t change your mind. (although I wish I could) <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /> I would hate to see anyone spend money on something that I believe is total BS. But to each his own.    As far as my DAN! goes, he/she could not even explain what goes own, AND HE/SHE IS DOING THIS FOR THEIR OWN CHILD!!!! When we pressured for answers, we were told that all he/she could say was that he/she \"thought of it as voodoo.\" Well that\'s what I want for my child. (NOT!) How can a doctor recommend something that they can\'t give an explaination for. If I wanted voodoo I would take my son to a voodoo doctor. This is not what I expected from a professional. My husband almost walked out on the meeting.  Maybe I should just overlook it if it\'s something that other DAN! are buying into. But I think this whole thing will just give the biomed critics another reason to call us quacks.    Again, please don\'t take any of this as a personal attach. I would never purposely offend anyone.

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">I gave him Benadryl yesterday morning, which seemed to take the edge off of his behavior and mood a little. My gut feeling is that he is having a yeast flare-up and/or a histamine reaction. I\'d appreciate Dana, Tami or anyone else\'s take on this. It\'s frustrating because cognitively he is doing well and this \"issue\" is really holding him back and making him (and the rest of us) miserable. </div>    Dana R,  Since you already noticed a positive reaction to the Benadryl, it\'s probably pretty likely that he\'s got high histamines.  The histamines don\'t cause Gavin to lose any cognitive functions.  They do make it hard for him to focus and give him many symptoms like aggression, saying bad words, \"boy behaviors,\" yeasty behaviors (yeast increasing histamines so this makes sense), itchy skin, and frustration.    The things we were prescribed were cal/mag, zinc, B6, MB12, methionine and TMG (though we discontinued this because of the MB12).   The things that are most helpful are 1)NDF PLUS...behaviors went away after very first dose.  This was two years ago.  The school was about to take him out of his regular class because of his behaviors.  Added in 4 drops of NDF PLUS. NExt day it was gone.   Though we later on still had ups and downs with histamines. It never got to that extreme point.  2)methionine  I gave this to him everyday.  Definitely definitely helps.  ANytime he has obvious histamines, I just up the dose for a while.  3)MB12 at one time took Gavin\'s remaning sensory issues away.  But we have notice that it does cause yeast flare ups which aggravates the histamines.    Avoid folinic acid at all cost.  It really seems to aggravate the symptoms.  I\'d say go with your mommy\'s instinct.   Hope this helps and let us know how he does!

' <div class=\"postbody\">Any mercury chelated directly by ALA will come out in the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><em><strong>POOP</strong></em></span>.  You could test that too, but you don\'t have a baseline there so I\'m not sure what you\'d compare it too.  The urine will now probably only contain the mercury that the DMSA picked up after it got dropped by ALA (before making it all the way out of the body).   Again though, my bet is that you\'re in a &quot;stall period&quot;.  Basically, you\'ve gotten the easy stuff out of the places that the DMSA can reach - i.e. kidneys, blood, etc.  The DMSA doesn\'t go very deep into the body or into cells, etc.  The ALA does do exactly that.  However, it takes the metals more time to make their way out of the deep tissue, brain, etc.  Stop leaning on the urine test as a measure of progress.  It will only tell you what came out in the urine (via DMSA) and mostly from the kidneys and other easy stores.  Sadly, even Cutler says there really aren\'t any good measures of full body burden of mercury.  Each test has some pretty pronounced flaws.  [As an alternative to urine tests, you could also try porphyrin or hair tests, though those are inconclusive too.]    As hard as it is to rely on, the best measure of progress is your kid and how he behaves over time.  Be patient and keep plugging.  We did minimal testing.  We were getting pretty frustrated just before the 1 year mark.  Just then the yeast began to clear, and the improvement became much more obvious and things have been slowly getting even better since (in fits and starts).  From what others have posted on the Yahoo! A-M group, that may be pretty typical.  The pattern that I think I see before we see more progress is that he gets foggier/spacier (as the metals are coming out again from a deeper store), then he comes out of it and is better than before.  [1-2 steps backward, but then 2-4 steps forward.]   If you keep at it for long enough, I think you\'ll see some of the permanent gains you\'re looking for.  The &quot;stall period&quot; is a expletive removed though, and you\'ll question yourself (whether it\'s working, whether you\'re doing the right thing, etc) many times before he comes out of it.  Patience and perseverance.   Best wishes to you and yours.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Folks,    I wanted to share an updated with our HDD trial, and see how other folks were doing.    a) We are now 2.5 weeks into the new protocal.  We\'ve seen modest progress with alertness.   He\'s modestly more responsive and aware, we think...    b) On the down side, we\'ve also continued to see a jump in stimming.  What he does is \"babble\" as we say, where he speaks to himself in a sing song voice...  There\'s definitely been a jump in this.  Also, in general, there\'s been hyperactivity, he\'s more wiggly.  We\'ve also seen a jump in his frustration level in general.  He\'s less patient....    So it\'s unclear at this point, what our final read is here.      But our assessment is complicated by a few other factors.  Remi started about 1.5 weeks ago his second cycle of HBOT dives.  I think, for example, we may be seeing yeast die-off associated with the dives (it happened the first time).  So I don\'t know if some of what we are seeing is this.      There\'s also been a cold going around my children in the family, from going back to school, and I think Remi may have been fighting off that.  At times, with illness, Remi will regress.    So anyway, I\'m bit confused, and am going to hold steady for another week or two, probably, through the first month.     Thanks,    Adam</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Copper is bad because a lot of people (and many ASD kids) are low in zinc/high in copper. Copper prevents zinc from being absorbed. Estrogen (in pregnancy or from other sources) increases copper. So you probably don\'t need more. But extra zinc is really good. Iron is really poorly absorbed in supplement form and can feed bad gut bugs so getting iron from food sources is much better. (Everything from food sources is better! But a good prenatal covers your bases.)  If it was me I\'d use a higher potency multi-strain probiotic. If cost is a factor it is more cost effective if you use it as a starter to make your own ferments.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />  Edited to add: I didn\'t know this until recently but zinc is also a huge factor in many birth defects.

' <div class=\"postbody\">ORAT,  Natasa posted a long time ago about how calcium channel dysfunction was a core issue in her kid\'s autism; you could search through the old posts and read her thoughts.  I did find this:  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">My rough take on all this would be: impaired methylation/gluthatione/detox leading to viral/bacterial/metal overload which in turns affects ion signalling (calcium in particular) and Central Nervous System function - I know this is all very simplified and only circumstantial at this point, but my mother\'s instinct is telling me I\'m right on this one and would bet all I\'ve got on it being the cas).   I believe dysfunctions in calcium homeostasis are probably at the end of the chain of events that lead to symptoms of autism, but a very important/strong factor, and if only we knew it for sure we would be then able to treat symptoms FIRST, GET OUR KIDS BETTER FAST and then slowly work on removing the real causes! in my dreamworld.   There are many things that regulate calcium channels, these are I believe mostly used in cardiac problems, where most of the research and trials on these is carried out. Not sure how much is known on their use in CNS.   There are many drugs and substances that regulate calcium metabolism in one way or another, of course no research so far on their use in autism, again not sure about general CNS research. I\'m thinking here e.g vitamin D and its synthetic analogues, and other synthetic derivatives.   On the other hand, I spend last few days researching things that seemed to help my son\'s symptoms the most, and most of them have been proven to regulate calcium metabolism/absorbtion in one way or another: SCD (see below), LDN (Naltrexone regulates calcium, most probably through L-type calcium channels it seems!), milk thistle, l-carnitine, low oxalate diet (actually medium ox diet in our case!). </div>   Also, she posted that Inflammation Control by Vitamin Research Products had an herb that was a calcium channel modulator &amp; her son had great improvement with it.  Might be worth looking into.  Renae</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">When Sasha\'s gut was at it\'s worst we did scd and it did help tremensously. We only did it for about 3-4 months but when we did I went cold turkey. His Oxalate levels did rise during that time b/c of all the almond flour I was using. His gut healed from what it was in a very short amount of time. He went from runny rank smelling poop to formed stools.   During the time he was on it I was also giving tons of diflucan and flagal prescribed by his pediatrician. We did about 3 OAT\'s during that period and his levels did improve tremendously.     For me it was very hard to stick with it. I continued to give ThreeLac every single say (2 packs a day) and I honestly think that the ThreeLac kelped him come off of SCD b/c it\'s keeping his yeast under control. That is just my guess though. He still eats high carb foods but I do keep rice and potato flours out of his diet for the most part. Even potato chips, I now give beet chips which are pretty good.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Aisha--The only new thing I started was the ALA this weekend.  I like to space out new supplements to really see what is working and what\'s not working, so I know the ALA made a difference right away.    If you can, Google all the info you can on Andy Cutler and his DMSA/ALA chelation protocl and schedule.  He recommends dosing schedules and amount of chelator per pound of the child.  His method is very low and slow.  Here is his schedule:  <strong>Dosage:  DMSA (alone or in combination with ALA): 1/8 to 1/2 mg of DMSA per pound of body weight, per dose  ALA (alone or in combination with DMSA): 1/8 to 1/2 mg of ALA per pound of body weight, per dose </strong>    The DMSA has to be given every 4 hours for 3 days.  ALA every 3 hours for 3 days.  I believe you have to let the body rest for the same amount of time you chelate.  I think most people follow 3 days on, 11 days off.    What has worked best for us is detoxing the body as best as we could before really going at chelation.  It\'s so true that you have to have the liver and colon and kidneys working efficiently so when you do chelation, these organs can filter out the yucky stuff so it doesn\'t redistribute and make things worse.      For the past 7 months I have been giving my son green lemonade, which is just juicing a mixture of green veggies (lettuce, kale, broccoli, cucumbers, etc.) with one lemon every day.  If you do research on lemons, they are fabulous liver cleansers with antiviral and antiparasitic properties.  I also add green powder to it for an added dose of green alkaline power.  I believe getting our bodies as alkaline as possible helps the body function better and reduces inflammation.  Robert Young\'s book \"The pH miracle\" is a great reference.    I give my son Primal Defense Ultra every day and coconut kefir for probiotics which has been great is getting his stools normal.  He poops twice a day now and has never been constipated since drinking the green lemonade.  My daughter drinks it too and within 30 minutes she poops! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" />     Have you looked into the ProEFA for speech?  I give my son 1 capsule daily of this and we have been using it for about 3 months now.  It is supposed to help with expressive speech.    I also use homeopathy and cranial sacral therapy.  I think both are a must for detoxing.  My son is a like a different kid after his adjustment. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />  My homeopathy does phone consultations if you want her number.  I think her website is up and running too.  Her name is Sally Williams.    My son is still nonverbal, but his desire to communicate with us is increasing, which is exciting for us.

Or, what if he\'s getting better, but the aluminum\'s not moving?  For us, we are putting our eggs into the - it\'s the aluminum - basket.  If we, through chelation, get all of the aluminum out yet he still has symptoms, we need to look elsewhere for the remedy. But how would we know we got all the aluminum out without an analysis?</div>'

I haven\'t decided or even got the results back from the tests! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" />   All I know is that Drew is a happier, healthier child thanks to the DAN! protocol!  No more constipation, aggressive behavior, no more screaming in pain from sensory issues, no more night terrors, he is reading, riding a two wheeler, laughing, singing, playing pretend, making friends, almost up to par with his speech, no more rashes, drooling, vomiting, staring into space, crying non-stop...   So if I am such a bad parent for wanting a healthy, happy child and one of a \"few\" that is vocal for our children, then sue  me!    Hi! Kathleen    Hope you enjoyed my post.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Last year during the time I was revamping my sonâ€™s vitamin regimen. (Also seeing what he no longer needed)  At this time we were running trials to see which new vitamin he likes as well as considering the dose amounts of supplement and how to increase some in other areas.    Anyway we had a period during these trials that my son started to become wacky/ silly at night and could not figure out what may have caused it. We were not doing anything different besides multies trials at that time. I though yeast yeast yeast and went crazy. Then I stated to change other things, which made it worse.  I had asked a few biomoms who I respect very much. And low and behold after 2-3 e mails one mom told me about a study that showed some children do not tolerate P5P and  it may bring about the same signs as a phenol issues.  I know those days because that was one of the first things we went through cleaning up my sons gut years ago.  Soâ€¦. we dropped the one multi that contained the P5P and the symptoms stopped the next day never to return.     Im not sure if that was the ONLY culprit considering how many things we changed when it happened.  But I can tell you we did isolate something and it is still highly possible    This is just a hunch based on what I had heard and saw with my child . Sorry  I never retried that multi again with  the P5P after we found one that worked well with my son.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Jen,  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Anyway, so she suggested that I should either try to make the same things they are serving at school, which really I dont think I would be able to manage that, and it probably wouldnt work since hed still know the difference... Or that maybe we should try a week of letting him have cafeteria food and see how he does.</div>  I think my interpretation is a bit different. It sounds to me that your son is and has been outwardly showing that he really wants the same thing that the other kids are eating. And she recognizes that as a problem not only for him but for the other kids. So in an attempt to try to come up with a solution, she is asking you to see if making similar foods would appease him to the point where he doesn\'t try to take the other kids foods or if it would be okay to attempt the school food. She probably doesn\'t understand (even if you\'ve explained it to her) that even small amounts of gluten and dairy can be extremely aggravating for him. Most people don\'t.  It doesn\'t sound like she\'s saying that she is not supportive of the diet but is asking for assistance in this situation trying to encourage him to eat his own food.     I have always made my son the same thing we were eating. If we had pizza, he had GFCF pizza. If we had spagetti, he had GFCF spagetti. There really is a GFCF version for everything now adays and if you need a recipe, let me know. My son used to be upset when the other kids would eat things he loved. So I would make him similar foods when this was the case. It may just be something simple like you get some GFCF pretzels or GFCF cookies and have them keep them at school for the teacher to give him when needed.  This made my son very happy as he felt more like the other kids. Our kids are smart and being different is not easy.  Giving them something similar may seem silly to us, but to them it really can make a difference. I would consider it.   I was very appreciative of my son\'s teacher asking me to bring some things into school to keep for special treats so he could have the same thing the other kids have (or close).     I think teachers are similar to us; trying to make sense of a situation there really is no handbook to. Even if she did not have the right answer, the fact that she\'s keeping the communication open with you is great. She is your eyes into his day at school and right now she\'s telling you that the food situation is not working out well. It\'s your move to tell her to deal with it with behavior modification or offer to send some GFCF foods that may make him less likely to steal the other kids foods.   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Tami</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Tami</div>'

Our son also had fine stools, with few signs of any digestive problems (had a bit of a distended belly earlier, but nothing conclusive).    We started him on MB-12 and within a few days we saw some very positive signs.  More flexibility, more spontaneity, better language, etc.  Teachers at his school noticed as well, w/o our letting them know what we were doing.  [e.g. We started MB-12 in May, 5 weeks before school let out.  Independently, the Speech Therapist commented, \"Your son has really been doing much better the last 5 weeks or so...\"]    Gains since due to MB-12, diet, and supplements have been impressive and I think we\'re being pretty objective.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello all,    Well I just wrote this morning on the enhansa thread on how well my son has been doing on the enhansa and everything else.  Of course the school nurse calls this morning and Mick has a weird rash all over his body.  Not the normal rash I am used to everytime he has die off.  This is bloachy (sp??  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarassed\" /> ) red spots all over his neck, face, arms, hands, back and some even on his legs.  It is absolutely HORRIBLE.  He is also very itchy and very uncomfortable.  The doctor for all the schools was there and he checked him out.  He believed Mick might be having an allergic reaction to the Flagyl.  He is on day 9 of it and only had 1 more day to go.      Okay his DAN doc just called back and said it is probable just a allergic reaction to the Flagyl and since he was almost done with it and it probably did what it needed to do, to stop it.  I was told to give him a warm bath with oatmeal (for the itching) and to give benedryl and that should help.

' <div class=\"postbody\">At one of our MANY visits to the constiaption clinic, castor oil was a topic.  Yes it is effective, but it does pose a danger with kids.  The reason it is not recommended any more is due to the risk of inhalation and suffocating.  I myself at the age of 36 took a teaspoon of rx cough syrup and inhaled it (36, you think I\'d be safe lol).  It was the most terrifying experience of my life and my (future) DH said even he thought I was going to die.  Just wanted to warn you, I know there are amazing benefits and for some this certainly is a choice to give and a helpful one at that.  Just wouldn\'t feel right if I didn\'t warn is all.  I have had great success with Senna and Ducosate Sodium.  Eventually able to wean off the Senna, and now even on a every other day with the Ducosate, which is HUGE for my son after severe constipation for years.

Here\'s my two cents because I have a gut kid who is overrun with yeast issues and had c diff as well. I would ramp up the probiotics. My daughter is 30lbs and 2.5y/o she takes 3-4 Klaire Detox Support (50 billion each), 2-3 sacc B, 4-5 culturelle, 1/2 teaspoon of therabiotic infant formula, 75  mg of diflucan and also amphotericin (I can\'t recall the dose on that...125 maybe) and I do transdermal OoO. I\'m still not convinced I do enough, but it\'s all helping quite a bit. When I was doing closer to what you are doing it got slightly better but then got worse.   Super Nu Thera is really hard for kids to tolerate. My dd didn\'t tolerate that either. Have you checked out either DRN or the vitamins by BrainChild? I would do a good multi first. if you do a search  you\'ll come up with a few threads of vitamin recommendations.

After the OSR (8 months or so) Mercury was finally coming out in the hair test.  ( a small amount but some is better than none) also Urinary Porpheryn Test was also much improved.

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">I am now thinking along the same lines regarding biomed. If i \"think\" my son is ill, am i encouraging it somehow, on a subconscious level by spending so much time on biomed, worrying about this or that, or missing out on this or that? </div> I think if you have negative thoughts/actions, negative things tend to come your way. (Just my belief). But please don\'t let anyone misunderstand that I do not IN ANY WAY believe that our negative thoughts bring upon autism. I think there were many things at work that does that, much outside of our control.  I just think that the more good thoughts you have, the more you see good things and good stuff comes your way.  Anyways, the first prayer I taught Gavin (and he still says it to this day) was before he could say much at all and he was still very sick. I wanted him to already assume he was fine, he was well, God had healed him.  The prayer is short cause I wanted him to be able to repeat it after me without getting frustrated,  \"Dear Jesus, thank you for healing me, I love you A-Men.\"   Autism changed my family, my beliefs, my outlook on life, on the idea that everyone is basically good.   I am an optimist at heart and so the best thing I did when I found out about my son is I removed as many of the \'negative\' influences in my life that were going to take any energy away from my work in getting Gavin well.  My uncle who said, \"Autism CANNOT be cured\" or my friends who looked at me like I was on drugs- I just stopped being in touch with them. I embraced those who believed as I did, \"RECOVERY IS POSSIBLE\" and that became my goal.    Without my friends, my family, my faith (which was nonexistent before Gavin), there is no way that we would be where we are. I remember the first time I prayed in years was when I realized I couldn\'t do this all by myself. I just begged God to help me. I promised that if he just showed me the way to Gavin\'s recovery, I would help anyone he put in front of me. Little did I know that the journey to recovery would be this long and this hard and it would literally be me who had to make the journey. I would find myself lost and then pray for help and within one week I would have a new path to take, a new thing to try, and many times- they worked. So I was able to trust that if I just did my part, we would find the way. I believe that the road I\'ve been given is the road that is/has been leading Gavin to good health, mental functions and an incredible future.  I believe that we all have our unique situations which we are meant to learn from and our lives will be enriched. But I have to say, it\'s really hard to see that until you get to the point where your child is no longer sick and no longer suffering.  We just have to support eachother as much as possible until that day comes.    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">The reason I ask is that when we received our new home, there is only carpeting on the stairs, for safety reasons...no carpeting in any other areas.  Kiernan\'s eczema cleared up overnight. He has not had one bout of it since. Like magic...no carpet, no eczema.   There are alot of toxins in the carpet fibers and alot of little critters (mites).

' <div class=\"postbody\">My grandson started kindergarten this year, having some of his classes with the special education teacher.  In  the last month he has become aggressive at school - hitting, kicking, pushing.  It is not just isolated to one class room, it can happen at any place.   Noah is on GFCF diet and various supplements, that haven\'t changed at all.  He had started taking the metho-B12 &amp; TMG but was taken off of that to see if that would help cut down the aggression, but that didn\'t seem to help.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Karen S,  I just wanted to let you know that there is thimerosal in the thimerosal -free flu vaccine.  It may be reduced from the amounts before and they don\'t have to list it as an ingredient because they add it in the process of manufacturing, not as a preservative.  But the fact is that trace(who says what trace amounts are?) amounts are STILL in the flu vaccine.  So don\'t think for one minute you\'re getting something that\'s thimerosal free.   This is another LIE that the pharmacutical companies \"comfort\"us with so we\'ll just go with the program.  The MMR vaccine doesn\'t contain thimerosal. If they added thimerosal to this LIVE VIRUS vaccine, it would be killed.  The dangerous thing about the MMR is that it\'s usually administered to kids that have a compromised immune systems (from previous vaccines or are non excreters of heavy metal) and it can wreck havoc in the intestines futher depleting immune system function.  In some cases the measles virus will just take over.....</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #FF0040\"><strong> Save 5.00 on 1st order code VEG287</strong></span> http://www.iherb.com/  *Twins*</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________  Save 5.00 on 1st order code VEG287</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi all,    I have a couple recipes that I have gotten my son to eat and I thought I would share. They are pretty easy to make and my son eats them up and he is a pretty picky eater. I\'m lucky that he will eat most fruit, but he won\'t eat veggies by themselves so like a lot of you I have to sneak it into his meat dishes. I hope your kids will like these too!      <strong>SQUASH MEATBALLS</strong>    1 lb. Mixed raw meats  1/2 a cup of pureed squash  1 egg  1/2 cup almond flour  salt to taste    Combine all ingredients.  Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes til done.  I bake them on parchment paper so they don\'t stick.      <strong>TURKEY TOTS</strong>    1 cup of finely ground cooked turkey (better boiled then baked)  1/2 cup of ground green beans (or another veggie/s)  2-3 ground or cut raw garlic cloves  Palm or Coconut oil  Salt  Spices (optional)    Combine the chicken, green beans and garlic in a bowl or you can also  grind the chicken, green beans and garlic together in a food processor.  Add spices or seasoning if you like. It should come out moist and pasty like tuna salad.   Roll into little meatballs and flatten like patties.  Add sufficient amount of oil in a pan or they\'ll stick.  Fry trhe little patties on both side untill brown - medium heat  They should look like tiny breaded burgers.  Sprinkle with salt and enjoy.  (I use a thin metal spatchula to flip them because with a regular plastic spatchula they tended to break. They are sort of delicate before they are all the way cooked.)      <strong>COCONUT OMELETTES</strong>    1 egg  1/2 TBL honey  1 TLB coconut flakes    Beat egg and honey together, andd coconut flakes and mix well.  Prepare as pancakes.    This is the only way I have gotten my son to eat eggs. I can get him to eat this because it is sweet. I don\'t make it all the time because of all the honey. I mostly just make it on the weekends.        Both of these recipes (except the coconut omelettes) I cook up in batches and then freeze the rest so on later dinners I just pop them in the microwave and heat up. It helps make life a lot easier.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #BF0040\"><strong>Knowledge Without Experience Is Just Information ~ Mark Twain</strong></span></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Knowledge Without Experience Is Just Information ~ Mark Twain</div>'

A local hospital lab ran the tests and we had the results in 3 days. We had him tested for Giardia, yeast as well. Family doctor actually thought that Giardia may have been the problem even though he tested negative for it. Treatment for Giardia is Flagyl as well.    BH is very hard to get rid of. I am planning on continuing grapefruit seed extract for a couple of months after Flagyl. We may ask to retest, just to be sure.     I did notice that my son\'s anxiety was higher as well. He begged to sleep in our bed. We actually let him. But it was for a totally different reason. We painted his closet prior to him getting sick and were thinking that the fumes were causing his sickness at night. Well, he slept in our bed for several nights and still kept getting sick.

After that, he developed migraines, that got so bad they were continuous.  He lays in his room all day, can\'t go to school, just a mess.  They went to MANY doctors, and were finally referred to a psychiatrist (!).  They have done it all--lots of alternative stuff, foot baths, great diet, many supplements, on an on, without anything making a dent.  At the end of last year, they drove to Philadelphia to get an IV of vitamin C.  He was pain-free for several hours, for the first time in years.  They were unable to get another for maybe 2 months--not sure why.  But it is the only thing that has ever made a difference.    So, I know he has an imbedded infection....so do many of our kids.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I think it\'s good that you are seeing that much more mercury coming out than before using the NDF PLUS.  I can\'t say if it\'s a good pull because I don\'t know if he\'s been pulling that much or more all along.  Or how toxic he is/was.  It appears that your child is able to excrete more now than prior to NDF Plus.  I think we have to base most of the \"is it working\" on the child\'s response rather than the actual numbers we are seeing in the tests.  Though they are very helpful in getting us to know if we are on the right track.    I would recommend testing your child\'s first morning urine pH.  IF it\'s above 5.8-6.2, I would highly recommend adding in Liver Life.   This should allow your child to excrete even more without aggravations.  You should be able to ramp the dose of NDF PLUS a bit quicker as well.  The more you are able to give (without aggravations), the deeper the detox, the better the results.     LEt me know what you see if you do test the pH.  I\'m very curious to know.      Can you sign this under a certain name, description so I can look for your posts and updates.

' <div class=\"postbody\">i<div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"> dont know what else to do. he is testing fine for ph so i dont believe liverlife is needed for him </div> Just so you know the pH is only 1 of many things the Liver Life helps with.  Are you familiar with Th1 and Th2?    Here\'s a really interesting piece of info <span style=\"color: green\"><strong>Resistance to infections is a Th1 immune system response as the cells activate macrophage and neutrophils to deal with the infections.  If Th2 response is dominant, you cannot fight infections as the Th1 immune response is inhibited.</strong></span>  Clinical studies have established that medicinal mushrooms are able to rebalance the TH1 and TH2 immune states, modulating the immune system.   And here... <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">http://www.anapsid.org/cnd/diagnosis/cheneyis.html  Th0 are the naive cells of the immune system. They are resting, just waiting for an invader. When infection occurs, they convert to either Th1 or Th2, depending on the type of threat. When the resting cell is exposed to a virus, cancer, yeast, or intracellular bacteria (like mycoplasma or chlamydia pneumonia), the Th1 response is initiated. (The weapons of the Th1 system include cytotoxic T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells.   On the other side are normal bacteria, parasites, toxins, and allergens. These trigger a predominately Th2 response. Its weapons include eosinophiles (Eos), polymononuclear cells (PMN), and antibody secreting cells (Ab).   How does the naive cell know which pathway to take? It depends on the cytokine information received. The presence of any organism from the left side triggers production of a cytokine called Interleukin 12. IL-12 causes the Th0 cell to move down the Th1 path. On the other hand, organisms on the right side trigger the production of Interleukin 10 (IL-10), which causes the Th0 cell to move down the Th2 path.   Viruses, especially herpes viruses like EBV, CMV and HHV6, make proteins that mimic IL-10. The virus deceives the immune system into thinking that the threat is coming from the opposite side! So the immune system shifts from the Th1 mode that attacks viruses to the Th2 mode that does not. The virus increases its chances of survival by diverting the immune system. It is now thought that many, if not most, pathogens have this ability.  </div>  Though chelation, for my son, was his biggest piece of the puzzle, I think regulating the immune system, restoring liver function, establishing a healthy gut, dealing with virals, parasites, chemicals, yeast and bacteria are very important as well.    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">and have not been at chelation long enough to want to switch to IV or even DMPS or DMSA but i am worried that this is it even with the chelation he will forever be functioning at this level and i just dont think i can handle that.</div>  My personal feeling is, if you are not noticing improvement, it\'s time to make a change to the protocol.  If progress stops for a short while, I think that\'s to go with the territory, but to get no progress for a longer period of time, I\'d opt for a revamping of my son\'s protocol. <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">i have hoped and fought for so long and i hate to be so ungrateful for gains he has made but i want more for him. </div> This doesn\'t mean you are ungrateful by any means.  You are happy he\'s better, you just want it to continue.    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">he is 8, potty trained, can speak though rarely chooses to, is ocd, is resistant to change, has echolallia(sp?), loves swimming movies and music and most recently ninetendo, will visually and verbally stim, for sure motor planning difficulties, fine and gross motor deficeits, rarely plays with toys, sensory issues, presents some aggression when overwhelmed or pushed too much.</div> If he\'s got OCD, maybe look into things that can increase serotonin. This is my current focus right now.  OCD is often the result of low serotonin.  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">gains he has made, likes to be praised, interacts with his brother, finally eating a variety of food, does not spin self and objects at all anymore, is now affectionate, greets and says goodbye appropriately, can be talked out of being upset or when things are not his way, comprehension and understanding is enormous gains</div>  Those are wonderful gains!!!  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">and im sure there are more i am just wondering why this process is sooooo slowwww?</div> It may be harder for you cause you have two boys to compare.   There are some kids who do take longer to respond than others.  I know there are many different reasons for that.  I wish it were easier.  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">perhaps the kids who are getting better functioning and having minimal difficulties from asd are those with only one problem with the vaccines and ours who are still a mystery and a puzzle are the ones who have all the problems associated and if this is the case will they ever recover? </div> Well that\'s a very plausible theory and if it\'s true remember that it\'s still not impossible.

We just had the greatest conference on Thursday - Brandon\'s teachers say he is now referring to himself as &quot;I&quot; when talking and he is going up to kids in the classroom and on the playground regularly to talk to them (some of it still can\'t be understood).  The teacher said about a week ago he was asked to stop his work and go to speech and he stopped immediately, packed up his things and put them away and went down the hall to speech. He looked in the door and there was another student in there and he was standing by the door as the teacher walked by and said to her, &quot;It\'s okay, I just waiting&quot; and did the sign for waiting. She said she smiled and walked past and was tearing up because she\'d never heard him say something like that or be so independent before. He has always been considered &quot;nonverbal&quot; by the school, I can\'t believe this is probably going to change this year!  At home, he is starting to answer you when you ask him things - even in a typical way, like &quot;mm-hmm&quot; for yes and saying other answers too. So the new language appears to be more than just words, because he has a new social presence too!  I thought I\'d tried EVERY protocol there was for speech, and we are FINALLY seeing results with this combination!! So I am sharing so that maybe someone else can try it and see if it works for their child. I\'m going to post this on my other groups, so if you see it again, you know it\'s the same thing.

And of course there is nothing I ever gave him I didnâ€™t test on myself.   From the best of my knowledge I donâ€™t have HM toxistity, however for future heath risks, I have decided to detox my body anyway. (Can only help)  Just like a healthy diet fasting, plenty of exercise , along with ,colon and liver cleanses. All these can only help the body revitalize to its maximum potential    Personally As of a month ago I have done over a 100 rounds of chelation.  What I wanted to share was how I have learned to listen to my Body if I knew I needed to adjust something. Same goes for my child.  Example To add minerals, antioxidants, probiotics and yes even look at the stool. Im from the old school when cars had carburetors  (maybe a man may relate to this example) but the best way to see the way an engine is running is look at the spark plugs .IMO learning the Dana method  (that some folks here have put down) will be your best tool you have in treating your child.  This is not guess work.   IMO if you learn to listen to your body it will tell you what you need to add change and or adjust. The AC protocol is the safest method of chelation if you do it correctly.  And yes the hard part is the dosing schedule. Just like any other thing that may be beneficial. Proper commitment is always  a key to see results.  But of course they donâ€™t t come over night. Chelation and detox is a process.   Often times itâ€™s a change in lifestyle  JMHO its is just as hard as someone who greatly out of shape always sick on a bunch of meds They will not be well until they are committed to do the right thing for a while and it may not be convenient.   IMO thatâ€™s the way they got overweight ,sick with a bunch of medical conditions in the first place   Hope that helps .This reminded me of a good article and comments .I recently read from Dr Mercolaâ€™s newsletter.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thanks so much for the information.    My son just turned 13.  He\'s verbal, but often switches words, ex:  calls a muffin-cupcake, calls glue-ink (happens a lot-common).  Often he won\'t \"hear\" what you\'ve asked him in that he\'ll respond with an answer which doesn\'t match your question, although similar.  Ex:  I ask:  Did ___ pass out candies with his valentines?  He says: Yes, ____ got a lot of valentines.  So there\'s a disconnect which can be it highly frustrating for me.  He\'s not aware that he does this.  (a lot).  Also he has trouble with school-work.  Very slow at producing the homework requirements, as well as trouble in other areas regarding school.    I was thinking of trying this, as he needs help with communication/cognition.  Now I\'m more hesitant as I hear that the side-effects are pretty certain.      He just began mb 12 two wks ago.  I was so HOPING he\'d be a responder to it.  So far I\'ve seen no difference.  Maybe it\'s too soon to tell.  If mb 12 helped him--it\'s supposed to help in this same area--then I\'d not do the memantine for sure.  So far I\'m not seeing a difference.    Now I feel scared about trying the memantine because of the side-effects.      He\'s in a different place than your son, as he IS verbal.  Yet--he DOES have great need of communication/cognition help &amp; improvement.  I can\'t imagine his future in relationships.  He\'d drive a wife CRAZY (not being able to respond to a question appropriately, for ex.)!!--He could be an engineer, so career-wise he\'d be fine.  His main focus is computer, computer, computer.  He\'s a whiz with all that stuff.  But as far as relationships in the far, yet near future...  Also getting thru school--high school--how will he do all the language related stuff, essays....    Thank you for sharing information on this.  I was scared about it at first when I thought I saw it was a prescription DRUG.  But then--I thought--he needs help in his brain.  Maybe it\'ll help him, making it worth it to take this for him, despite it being a drug.  Now I\'m worried regarding side-effects.  As he\'s older, he\'d be more aware of them, plus he has to go to school, rather than still being a pre-schooler where we could get thru the time before side-effects diminished.    Thanks.

' <div class=\"postbody\">This might be out there, but...  We are doing a round of diflucan right now, and are seeing regression.  My DAN thinks it\'s a strep flare.  Kill off the yeast, the bacteria grows in the &quot;space&quot; that\'s left.  I mention this because I think we have done the same three times here in the winter.  I am seriously wondering why this seems to be a pattern--could strep be a bigger problem in the winter, maybe because of no sun and so little outside play?    Anyway, could there be something like this rearing its ugly head?  We are seeing OCD and anxious behavior from the strep.  I am actually going to call my DAN to see if we should soldier through the round (a full month, and we are still ramping up to full dose) or pull back and do something different.  Edited to add:  We have been working with JeniB\'s &quot;bean diet&quot; and while we cannot eat the beans several times a day, as suggested, we HAVE been able to take soluble fiber (Walgreen\'s version of Metamucil in capsules) several times a day for my kids and me.  It is having a great effect in many ways.  One that I\'m seeing is that it\'s keeping yeast at bay.  The &quot;mold people&quot; say that psyllium soaks up toxins, sort of like activated charcoal, and it is a daily staple for people who are doing toxic mold detox programs.  My kids like to drink the &quot;Tang&quot; flavored kind (sugar-free orange flavor) while my oldest and I swallow two capsules three times a day.  After all these years, I\'m surprised at how much of a good difference something so simple is making for us.  And it\'s natural, so maybe it would not be a problem to add it with homeopathy.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

When we went to 500 mg, we started getting defiant behavior that some have reported, but this went away when we went back to the 250 mg. dose. But what worked for us may not work for you.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Some call it pre-verbal or emerging speech as opposed to non-verbal.    I think children who are &quot;non verbal&quot; in the common use of the phrase are those who don\'t yet have any spoken words, not even scripting or echolalia that they can use functionally.   They might be able to babble, but they don\'t say words or repeat words.   A lot of people use the word &quot;verbal&quot; when what they mean is &quot;vocal&quot;.  We do Verbal Behavior ABA and my child is verbal - she can talk in functional sentences.  However, our analyst says that even children who communicate primarily through sign language or an augmented communication device are considered &quot;verbal&quot; because they are fluent in using those tools to express their innermost thoughts.  They\'re using those tools for functional communication and that\'s what being verbal means.  People who are hard of hearing and who sign consider themselves &quot;verbal&quot; even if they aren\'t vocal.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #800000\">There are many paths to autism.

Can I add baking powder/soda to the bananna pancakes? He hates eggs, so that is why he wont eat them.    I just ordered a legal sac b, acillidophilus, houston peptizyde yogurt maker and starter.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello,  My son is 4y 1m.  He was DX on April 1, 09 after a 45 min assssment with a Ps.  Her exact response to me was he has Austim yea I think that is right.  HFA that will look like Aspergers in the future.  He will need to be retested in a year.  My son did not show any signs of Autism until he was 26months old.  When he just did not want to be around other people and it has gotten worse.  My favorite picture of him is him sitting with the Easter bunny staring straight at the camera with a huge smile on his face.  We had started Biomed TX before the DX because like all of us we knew something was different.    We did a OAT test and he has High Yeast and a few other high markers that our DAN says is because of yeast.  We did a stool sample 1 month later and it showed again high yeast and high bacteria which was not on the OAT test.   I guess that shows you how fast it grows.     My question is how do you know that your son has allergies or high histimines or metals or a low immune system.  My son has a chronic runny nose which stopped after I removed casien and increased Vit C.  He has bad ezcema which he had since birth.  It has gotten better with the biomed TX.  I  am sorry that this is so long, but I gave a history in case any of you really intelligent people can help me.  Thank you..    Take Care   Stacy</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Mary,    Yes, we already started the diet, and yes we have seen gains. However, unless I see regression when stopping it, I\'m worried that I won\'t know for sure that the diet is what has \"caused\" the gains and progress.  Part of me wants to know, simply for the sake of truth, and part of me wants to know as a matter of pride.  The EI team that I am dealing with seems skeptical about the fact that the diet is what has made the difference.  Speaking of pride, I think they would prefer to take the credit themselves.  However, the services I have received for my son to date have been minimal, and the real gains just-so-happened to become evident after changing his diet.  So the short answer to your question <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\" /> is that I want to experiment with reindroducing milk to see if it has a negative affect.  Some suggest waiting, but my thought is that it is better to find out now rather than later.  Just wondering if anyone else has any compelling evidence to the contrary.</div>'

The mutation will not allow the folate to turn into the active methyl form, namely 5-methyltetrahydrofolate which interacts with MB12.  For this, you may have to supplement 5-MTHF.    <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylcobalamin\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylcobalamin</a><!-- m -->  This is also another interesting link covering the MTHFr mutations: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenetetrahydrofolate_reductase\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenet ... _reductase</a><!-- m -->   .....after reading this, look at the end for further suggested reading on dietary recommendations.  As for the heterozygous status concerning COMT, Rockhopper is correct that your child might not be able to tolerate too much methyl donors because of an innate tendency to have dopamine fluxes and thus, mood swings.  Hydroxycobalamin, Cyanocobalamin and Adenosylcobalamin may be acceptable forms of b12.    Hope this Helps!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hey Yall. I could use some advice.  My son has been on Valtrex for months at 250mg 3x/day. We really never saw any regression or gains. Because of our DAN\'s ego(IMO) and lack of familiarity with the Valtrex protocol, she would only agree to Amphotericin B daily, which she then weeks later asked \"Why are you on Ampho B?\".  What we did see was a struggle with yeast and a strange clear/white tiny bump rash that we\'ve never been able to get rid of. Ketaconizole cream had no effect.   We\'ve since, at the DAN\'s recommendation(since she coudn\'t recall stubbornly only being willing to go with Ampho B daily), switched to rotating Diflucan, Ketaconizole, naturals and Ampho B. Needless to say, we can only go about a week or so on naturals before getting \"yeasted up\". We just got a refill of Ampho B because we are \"yeasted up\" again.  On 12/1, I increased his dose to 250mg 4x/day. So far we don\'t see any difference. I am seriously considering whether we should drop Valtrex after another month if we don\'t see a breakthrough.  I just ordered charcoal for the first time.    How much charcoal do you folks use and when do you give it?  Have you seen and dealt with a rash like this one?  What kind of diet are you using? Since my son can\'t have eggs, SCD appears to be a bad option.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Parent of  7 YO PDD-NOS 5 YO NT</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Parent of  7 YO PDD-NOS 5 YO NT</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Since you hadn\'t gotten an answer, I wanted to say that we have battled yeast as our biggest issue for five years now.  Biomed and diet were not as well understood then, but we did not know that yeast was something that was THAT hard to beat.      Candida is a very, very hard thing to eradicate.  That\'s why the low oxalate diet is so interesting to many doctors--there is a theory that the yeast is trapped in oxalate crystals in tissues, and is released periodically to reinfect the host.  They aren\'t sure, though; what they are sure of is that yeast is a tough thing to get rid of, and they are not sure why.    Many have had success with Primal Defense (has a different breed of organisms to fight yeast than the usual) and some other probiotics and antifungals, but the reality is that, if you have a bad yeast problem, you will probably have to address it with diet and yeast-fighters for a very long time.  If you have continual backsliding, then I suspect it would be wise to investigate things like the BED and such.    It is my opinion, after over five years of doing this, that you should consider doing the SCD WITH the yogurt.  We did the SCD on and off for 1 1/2 years without it, but with large doses of other probiotics, and never reestablished the good colonies of bacteria.  A waste of a lot of time, in many ways. I have come to believe that the yogurt is necessary.    Just my opinions.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">oh, yeah. you betcha. there needs to be an ND in every town with one!  barbara ketover said it took her about six years of practice to be able to get reliable (i assume reproducible) readings. she said a lot of people come out of a quick training course as &quot;certified&quot; but that doesn\'t mean they are really qualified to use it. there is the aspect of being able to physically locate the meridian points and use the correct pressure, etc. and then there is the aspect of, based on the intake information and other information, being able to choose which of thousands and thousands of triggers to test. you have to know where to look for what you\'re looking for. but they had a pretty good system of testing a larger file folder (say parasites). if it tests positive, then look at parasites A-E, if that tests positive then look within that folder. sounds simplistic but it\'s based somehow on frequencies and for me the proof is really in my daughter\'s stools and food tolerances.  we are doing OK testing less frequently. it\'s definitely not ideal but it\'s still working. i would love it if we could go there every two weeks but obviously not feasible.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Learning to jiggle when shaken.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Learning to jiggle when shaken.</div>'

This is one way that the Liver Life helps.  I\'m really glad to hear your little one is not experiencing any negatives from chelation. Is he experiencing any positives?    I meant to add more to my previous reply but got side tracked. Tums doesn\'t help in preparing for chelation as it just neutralizes the stomach acids (and contains aluminum which contributes to the toxicity), it doesn\'t help to decongest the liver/kidneys and/or balance pHase I and II liver detox pathways which is one of the reasons LL is so helpful in preparing for detox.    Nella,  I personally feel that IV\'s are something that should be worked up to. SO if given the choice between IV or suppositories, I\'d do the suppositories first and see how those are tolerated.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Sugars help things ferment better.  Lots of carrot or squash in our fermented veggies work well for us.    My DS was only on broth and meat for the first couple days.  We slowy added veggies one at a time as per what we usually eat (spinach, carrots, green beans) and what his (new at the time) food allergy test did not show reaction to.  This actually left us pretty limited, as I understand is often the case when you start rotating foods for tolerance.  Then we slowly added fruit, one by one, again based on what we usually eat starting with banana.  We held off on nuts or almond/pecan flour (I ground my own, such a tedious task) until eight weeks in.  By that time his stools were normal and there was no more yeast rash.  Once we started the muffins, he liked them so much he would sneak and get them and was eating primarily almond and/or pecan flour muffins.  He became severely constipated doing this and was in great pain.  After we got him cleared we imposed a no-more-than-once-a-day rule.    That\'s what WE did.  That\'s what works for us.  He does not now have a yeast problem and his stools are formed and the same, at the same time every day.

The booklet or documentation should have given you a prioritization of which SNP\'s to work on first. If you have a CBS defect, you might start treating it first. Also, I would determine whether your defects show whether your child should remove methyl donors or encourage methyl donors. Have you done stage one yet? What are your results?

Problems with Sulfa Family Residue (all the detox systems, problems with liver detoxing so we stimulated the liver to detox), he also showed he was storing toxins in the brain.    Problems with Pertussis, Diptheria, and fungal toxins (large bowel)    Problems with Smallpox (yes, smallpox), cadmium, Rubella, and Dental Chord (which is true, his jaw is misaligned)    We didn\'t get the MMR, but what I have a feeling is happening, our generation that got the MMR first, grow out of their immunity to a part of this vaccine, mainly Rubella, and get it when pregnant. We don\'t show symptoms of it and causing problems with some at birth (my guy has always had the staring thing, but was always very social (except when he regressed this spring). He also began having muscle weakness around 2-3  months old.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I have been asking lots of diet questions lately - here\'s another one.  How long have you noticed withdrawal symptoms lasting?  We have been CF for almost 2 months.  We didn\'t notice any withdrawal symptoms but after about a month saw positives including the beginning of potty training.  We added in GF 10 days ago.  Trevor is accepting the foods, which is great, and we started seeing clearer speech after 4 days (could still be from the CF making the MB12 work better I guess).  However, now that we are also GF, we have been seeing diarrhea every other day and also a return of tough tantrums.  His behavior over the past few days has been very difficult for us to handle.  He just seems so full of rage and anger.  He has happy moments as well and some calm times, but if he doesn\'t get what he wants immediately, look out!  He has always been this way but the tantrums are lasting longer and he has added in hitting and spitting (throwing objects too, which he has done in the past).  He just seems very angry and we don\'t know how to handle it, especially with two other children to take care of as well.  Could these still be withdrawal symptoms after 10 days?  What withdrawal symptoms have you seen with your children and how long did they last?  I should also add that Trevor is on MB12, Dr N\'s vitamins/minerals, CLO, and probiotics (only the probiotics are also fairly new - within the last month or two).  We are looking to start Liver Life - I just need to find the time to actually order it...    Lisa</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I personally would try the zinc espically if you have it on hand.  Are you using anything with Zinc in it.  If so that might rule out the zinc.  If you have some on hand I would try you will know pretty fast if that is the problem.  Should not take much more then about an hour to tell.  My son had so many teeth pulled and was loosing his baby teeth that he stopped grinding his teeth and started clicking his tounge.  If I give him zinc he stops.  That would be a pretty clear indication Zinc is the culprit.  That being said you could test for parasites.  Or if you have a parasite killer on hand try that.  I happen to have both on had at all times. So for me it is pretty easy.  I also have the MannaBears so I can target him pretty fast.  I have stuff that I know works for him.  Zinc is not expensive but grinded up taste like c--- so if your child can swallow pills that could make it difficult.  Mine will take it crushed up but he is pretty good about taking all gross stuff.  He can\'t swallow pills so we do it the icky way.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">The GF/Cf diet was awful for my son, and we did it for a year. He was chronically constipated, and ate all those pre packaged Ktoos, chips, etc... it was killing his system. I thought this diet would eventually help, so I kept doing it. We also consistently treated him for yeast during this time, and it never went away. All of those sugars and carbs in those foods just fuled the yeast. Even though they were rice flours, they are still flour.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Aisha, my kid is 6 1/2 also, a total non-responder to all DAN protocol (I\'ve done all of it).  The 24hrs EEG and the MRI were actually prescribed by my out-of-state DAN, but I had the prescription re-written by a local pediatrician, so that the insurance and the hospital would accept it. The pediatrician wrote in the Dx. &quot;Suspicion of early morning seizures&quot; (even if we never actually had a seizure); I also always ask my insurance company for their Policy Bulletin for EEG and MRI, or other, so that I know in advance which diagnosis codes and which procedure codes will be covered according to my policy. I then ask the pediatrician to code accordingly. That way I do not have bad surprises when the bill comes, and I always get it covered. I did not have to pay for EEg nor MRI.   When I consulted with Dr. Miranda he also required the 24hrs EEG and the MRI (they need to be of a specific format), but as I already did them, he was happy to just have the actual tracing (very important) and interprete them himself. His comments were very different from the ones made by the hospital techinician, Dr. Miranda found many abnormalities, while the hospital found none.  It is important to do a 24 hrs EEG, because 80% of seizure activity happens at night, and no sedation or the results will be falsified. Any EEG shorter than 24hrs might not capture the seizure.  The DEEP-EEG is not medically necessary, it is a nice test to have to decide on drug intervention, I\'ll let you know what the insurance will respond, as well as the doctor.  TAke care</div>'

I cannot even remember the last time he has this many days with normal poop.  Today my husband left for work and he said - &quot;bye daddy I will miss you&quot;  He has never said I will miss you - EVER!!  This afternoon we went to the store.......here are some things he said..........there\'s a bunch of cars mom (looking at the cars in front of us), there are 2 houses (pointing at houses), he saw the sign for Target and said look at the sign - I asked him what it said and he said TARGET!,  then there was sort of a sentence about Manny from Ice Age and the baby Peaches and how they are elephants with long trunks - it didn\'t come out in a complete sentence but I knew exactly what he was trying to say!  Oh yeah and the other day I just remembered that he grabbed some celery sticks off of my husband\'s plate and ate it!  He never eats celery - not sure if this has anything to do with the Cytoflora.  And he asked to go to the House of Bounce (it\'s a place that has a bunch of those inflatable slides and stuff that kids can jump on and slide down, etc - we are in the northeast so it\'s nice for someplace to go in the winter time) and said that he has fun there.  All of these things are new words, new sentences.  It has to be from the Cytoflora.  Thanks to everyone here who posted about their success with it - without this site and this group of people I never even would have known to try it.  I think we are seeing some great stuff here.   I have a question however - I started the first day with 1 dropper - then went to 2 droppers twice/day - maybe I did that too quickly but I really did not see anything but good things from it.  I am still using 2 droppers twice/day.  Should I increase it?  When should I increase and by how much?

' <div class=\"postbody\">Except for the phlegm thing, this is what I go through with chronic fatigue, not as much now since I moved to a better diet.    However, we bought a used car and they detailed it before we took it home and it stuck so bad with some sort of fruit scented chemical spray that I was extremely extremely fatigued the whole night and very very agitated.  My hubby got a huge headache from it when he drove it later that night.   So my guess is it has to do with the bodies inability to process certain toxins of whatever kind.    Things that help me with chronic fatigue: all natural diet (as organic and free range a possible), low grains, raw sauerkraut, kelp, epsom salt orally (not enough to induce diarrhea), juicing fresh juice.  Lecithin gives me a brain buzz however since it feels like my brain is not fully on all the time (people with CF will most likely understand like mental tiredness), I use it sparingly, one cap every 2 days seems to be okay or it keeps me to awake.  High does of vitamin c used to be good for me, now if I take too much I get a sore throat- not sure why.

NAIS would require that all farmers and farm animal owners implant their animals with a computer chip, even those who just own a single cow, horse, chicken or other farm animal. Last week, the USDA approved the use of two new types of chips for the NAIS program. These same chips have already been planted in millions of pets and marketed to pet owners as an ID device to help find lost pets. Increasingly, these same chips are being marketed and implanted into humans. Evidence has now surfaced that a significant number of studies done in the 1990s revealed that lab animals implanted with the devices developed tumors. When the FDA approved the use of the chips for human implanting, these reports were never made public. In an interview with a retired toxicologic pathologist who studied the chips for Dow Chemical,\"The transponders were the cause of the tumors.\"  Learn more: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_7570.cfm\">http://www.organicconsumers.org/article ... e_7570.cfm</a><!-- m -->   ___________________________________   QUICK RELATED FACT:  WHO APPROVED TUMOR-CAUSING CHIPS? The FDA is overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services, which, at the time of the original RFID chip\'s approval, was headed by White House appointee Tommy Thompson. Two weeks after the device\'s approval took effect on Jan. 10, 2005, Thompson left his Cabinet post, and within five months was a board member of VeriChip Corporation, the company who designed the RFID chip. He was compensated by VeriChip with cash and stock options. In his public appearances, he continues to claim the chips are completely safe and urges all citizens get the implants for the sake of the health and safety of their families. To date, neither Thompson nor any member of his family has had the chip implanted.    </div></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #FF0040\"><strong> Save 5.00 on 1st order code VEG287</strong></span> http://www.iherb.com/  *Twins*</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________  Save 5.00 on 1st order code VEG287</div>'

Some say baby spinach isn\'t as bad as other greens but I still rotate just in case.  Like today we are doing romaine lettuce, tomorrow will be baby spinach and the next day I will give sunflower sprouts and buckwheat sprouts then maybe kale or collard greens then I will start the rotation again.  I also add  periodically carrots but they do contain sugar so be careful with yeast.  I also give celery which is great for the liver.  Potatoes are good for stomach ulcers if you juice a small amount of that but at the moment I have had to be very careful with the fruits because of yeast.   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /></div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Aisha, we got to full dose LDN (five lines) after about 10 days only, he was fine with it for about a month. But then he had an infection - don\'t know what it was, probably viral, but he had a VERY high fever, very lethargic and Winnie, this was followed by regression... I read of someone with similar experience, their fever and regression went away after they lowered LDN to half, so we did the same and it worked. We then worked our way back to full dose but two weeks later the same thing happend - again extremelly high fever, and regression that just would not go away. After day three I decided to lower the dose to three lines again that night and in the morning he was his smiley lovely self again...fever gone.    Since then we have tried upping the dose but as soon as we get to about 4 lines he gets very irritable and hard to handle. We just decided that since he did so well on 3 lines to leave it at that. I have since heard a few people noticed the same thing with their kids - fine with full dose for a while, then became very sensitive and did better with less... the important thing to find the right level but it is not that hard.    Re No.1 intervention if you asked me two months ago it would have been LDN but now I would say Inflammation Control. To be honest I think it is probably the combination of those two.    Best of luck and fingers crossed for you - keep us posted.

Many of the minerals are greatly increased b/c my son is not absorbing them correctly.  The only way we can do chelation is if we increase them a lot.  But hopefully this problem will be healed when we have Dr. Buie do the colonoscopy and endoscopy on him and we do HBOT.  (We will prob. save a lot of money on the supplements too!!!  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />     I definitely think you should try the MB12 again.  Mickey was very, very hyper and chewed on everything for many weeks.  Then he improved.  He will still chew every so often, and then it stops again.  This helped so much with his speech.  When my son started babbling, it did take a while for him to make it to the next step, but he did.  It is amazing how just a little over a year ago he was completely non-verbal.          Mikselva,       My son did tons of oral exercises since about 16 months old when he started speech services.  He didn\'t really start improving until we started Biomed.  He continues to do oral motor exercises in his speech pull-out at school.  I know they do a lot of blowing bubbles, blowing those magic paint markers, little horns, straws.

' <div class=\"postbody\">We had a good round and, wanted to posts and update but was busy this weekend. Ohh!! I was gona remind folks who are doing AC protocol that this was the easy daylight saving time of year. BC we turn clocks ahead . So you donâ€™t have to figure out the dosing schedule and math during the AM doses. After your last late night dose turn you clock ahead and the next dose you can do early by an hours or so. More frequent is easier and not have to worry about nor figure out the math. Always safer and more convenient to keep within the guidelines of the half-life of the chelator.   HTH  Oh Btw My son and I had a wonderful weekend together. He touched so many folks at bunch of stores we went to.   From just joking around to sharing testimony, vaccine dangers.  He even blessed a few people by Introducing himself that opened up a conversation with his humor.   In fact I had met a father at the Home depot &gt; we started with mercury in light bulbs, spoke about epidemics and health issues which led to sharing he had a kid with Autism.  We spoke for about 20 minutes about his son, his condition and progress.  The conversation led to biomed and his asking for more info. We exchanged hone numbers.   Ya never know whom you may bless or meet when you are doing a round. Stay with it slow and steady wins the race.

If he\'s not detoxing, then his pH is pretty darn good.  (5.8-6.2 is healthy range).    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">When should I start giving the LL (if at all)?</div>  If you have it there and haven\'t started anything within 2 weeks, you can start it now.    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Do I need to consistently test pH for a while before starting? </div> No, you just want to get a baseline to get an idea where he\'s at.  It\'s not mandatory just a helpful tool.  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Also, once on LL, do you recommend that their urine continues to get tested every day? </div> If the urine pH\'s are high, yes until you notice them going into range.

I\'m just not really sure what the numbers mean, etc.</div>  It means that he\'s draining acids.  When this happens, it decreases the chance for detox reactions.  All detox agents (chelator, virals, antibacterial, antifungals) increase the rate of acid excretion.  So if you aren\'t able to drain acids efficiently, you would experience more reactions (coldlike symptoms, rashes) when you increase the rate of acid excretion.   You might also consider testing the first morning saliva pH to see if he\'s at a good place with his body\'s pH.  Unfortunately it doesn\'t tell us anything about the rest of the liver functions.  So LL is still recommended and found beneficial for those who have perfect urine/saliva pH\'s.      Hope this helps.

You can avoid it by planning ahead and bringing in a GFCF version of what they have. I do that with my son, have for 8 years and he knows that it\'s because the other foods make him feel bad. Initially he didn\'t understand but since he got something as well, it wasn\'t a big deal. They have GFCF cookies, ice cream, pretty much anything that can be substituted.  It is challenging getting it all in place but once everything is, it actually runs pretty smooth. His school notifies me ahead of time when there\'s a birthday or something special coming up.

We have been using the Houston enzymes- currently we have taken him off of them until I figure out what to do.    Alex\'s mom, from reading other posts of yours, our sons sound very similar! My son started new autistic behaviors after I started enzymes that I have never seen him ever do!  Most of what I read about enzymes is very positive, I just finished the enzyme book and it seemed so encouraging. I mean enzymes are even good for people that are not ASD just for overall digestion.

The remedies, both made by Lanzhou Traditional Herbs, are called Emperor\'s Tea Pill and Hepatico Extract. Their labeled uses are to help \"maintain the body\'s natural balance\" and \"promote a healthy liver and maintain regularity.\"     Health officials discovered the products\' high lead and mercury levels while investigating the case of a city resident who got lead poisoning.     Lead and mercury are poisonous metals that can damage the brain, nervous system, reproductive system and other parts of the body. Pregnant women, their fetuses and children are the most vulnerable.     The city Health Department has ordered store owners and distributors who sell these products to remove them from shelves and post signs warning customers against taking them.     Anyone who has either product at home should return it to the place of purchase, get tested by a physician for lead and mercury poisoning and keep the product away from children, health officials urged.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">We are i believe starting to have the same problem. We just got back from Florida, my guy has been doing so well and after being there a week he is getting very hyper and he has been peeing like crazy! Soaking his diaper every morning and on our ride back to NC, he went through 3 pairs of shorts. We have also started avoiding fruit and I\'ve seen the hyploglycemic symptoms with this before. But, if he has it, he is in a constant state of yeast growing and dying (on and off good and bad, it is very frustrating) I imagine that if they have seasonal allergies, things like yeast get more out of control because their immune system is weakened by the allergy and possibly causing increased inflammation as well. The symptoms sound so much like intolerance or yeast to me. When I read your post, first thing that popped in my mind was the 7 month regression. I bet that is a big part of it. How has his poops been looking? Sorry you\'re having a rough time. It comes and goes so much and it\'s so heart breaking when you\'ve had such a great improvement. I\'m anxious to start chelating. I really think the biggest thing for us is this. We tried the Pectasol Chelation complex, mostly to mop up the die-off (we only used it about 7 times) and we have finally had some gains that have STUCK, even with the yeast flares. Much more talking and aware, pointing and asking for things. This tells me that metals are a big problem for us. The downside to this stuff is that it is a polysacchride. illegal on the diet, but I\'m going to use it in small spurts here and there because I think that he needs it to get ahead eventually. I can\'t keep feeding him this way, with no fruit....it is very hard and I think bad for him. I worry about this hyploglycemia I\'m getting right now. He sweats a lot too. I really hope that chelating finally clears up this bad yeast/bacteria/allergy problem we have. We are on a strict diet and using prescription anti-fungals and we still have a terrible time with yeast.     Jen</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Just wanted to say that I bought the oral lipoceutical glutathione from Brainchild at the DAN! conference and have given it to Cameron for the last 2 days (only 1/2 tsp per day).  Tonight, he was pretend playing with a new toy that my wife bought him -- putting Dora  the Explorer and Tico the Squirrel into a car and driving them around and over a bridge.  He was giving the car to Mom to have a turn, pointing and saying bridge (well, his approximation).  I know that might sound trivial, but we haven\'t seen pretend play much up to this point even though we\'ve been driving it into his head through ABA and one on one with my wife and me.     We have not chelated for the past 3 weeks because we were waiting for urine results, so we have not changed anything except the glutathione.      Maybe he needs the sulpher in it -- I don\'t know.    The only side effect that I did notice was that he\'s developed a bit of trembling in his hands -- like he\'s overly excited -- not flapping, just shaking.  I\'m a bit concerned about that, but it didn\'t seem to me like seizure activity -- he was playing straight through.    He was VERY interactive tonight.

This can be true but we as parents need to inspire our children to be all that the can be.  I won\'t be surprised at all if the children that are affected with Autism are leaders running our country and the world in the future.

' <div class=\"postbody\">This is exciting to me!  This is a post from Andrea Fabry\'s blog.  She\'s the woman I\'ve mentioned whose whole family (7 kids!) got VERY sick in their Colorado home from toxic mold. They had to leave the home and moved to Arizona for mold treatment and to start a new life.  I think they\'ve been treating their mold sickness for about a year and a half; don\'t remember exactly.  Google &quot;Fabry Mold&quot; and you\'ll find her blog.  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Family Experiment Weâ€™ve been conducting a family experiment this month. Itâ€™s a dietary experiment. The experiment involves a no grain/no fruit eating plan drawing on such diets as GAPS, SCD, BED, Paleo, Phase 1 Antifungal, and Bee\'s, as well as other candida diets.  Weâ€™ve been following a diet free of sugars and processed foods for quite some time now. One of my daughters and I tried a hard-core version of GAPS (Gut and Psychology Syndrome) several months ago. Her digestive tract was severely hit by the mold, and GAPS offers a way to slowly heal and rebuild the gut flora and cellular structures surrounding the lining. The diet revolves around homemade bone broth, vegetables, and probiotic foods such as sauerkraut, kefir, and fermented vegetables.  I noticed an immediate improvement for myself. The increase in energy was followed by a severe period of die-off. This occurs when the fungi/viruses/bugs, etc. die and leave the body. It is common to feel much worse. (See this previous post.) My daughter noticed improvement in her brain/gut connection, but also experienced intense die-off.  The diet felt too restrictive for the others in our family. Suggesting it to the remaining 9 members seemed out of the question.  Until my friendâ€™s 5-year-old son had open heart surgery. He came through the procedure well, and in the hours following the surgery he could not drink water. I watched as his mom painfully dabbed water onto his thirsty lips.  Then it happened. I had an awakening. Water is a good thing. For the sake of her child and his fresh incisions, however, she held back until he was healed enough to drink.  I thought of my 10-year-old son with type 1 diabetes. What if we removed sugar in the form of fruit and grains for a period of time? What if this gave his body the opportunity to heal and stabilize in a way mold avoidance and whole foods has not?  If a doctor told me to take sugar out of his diet, I would listen. I decided to listen to my instincts.  My husband, my 10-year-old, and the remaining members of the family agreed to a one-month trial. Some had already experienced the healing benefits of the bone broth and were eager to move forward. Removing the food source for our fungus-infested bodies made sense.  We began the experiment on Sunday, August 1. We fasted on chicken soup for 24 hours. Nothing but soup for 11 of us!  Several members of the family had severe die-off response immediately. One even vomited. Others felt intense sugar cravings. There were fits of rage. High levels of irritability. Rashes appeared in the days following the fast.  I kept picturing our little friend in the hospital. &quot;Do the hard thing,&quot; I told myself. My husband and older kids agreed.  Then something amazing happened. For the first time in the three years since Colin was diagnosed, he went an entire day without a shot. His blood sugar stayed in range all day.  Weâ€™ve added more foods since that day. Some of our family members are sensing the need to stay with the limited bone broth/probiotic foods, adding avocado, different vegetables, specific oils, and wild caught salmon. Others have graduated to seeds and salads. All of us are refraining from fruit and grains.  This week our acupuncturist commented on the improvement he has seen in us. Specifically he noted the change in me. &quot;I can see evidence that the lining of your digestive tract is indeed healing,&quot; he said.  I cannot believe the change in my energy level. My skin is much softer.  Iâ€™m grateful for the extra energy, because the demands of this diet are enormous and the expected time frame for healing the gut flora is two years or more. For some of my kids I can see that it will take at least this long.  I have been in tears numerous times in the kitchen this month just trying to keep up. Iâ€™ve questioned and doubted. Wondered what mistakes Iâ€™m making. I cut my finger severely two weeks into the diet and felt defeated.  Somehow weâ€™ve made it through. Everyone has become an expert on cutting vegetables and creatively using them in recipes. The behavior of our two youngest has improved dramatically. (Though Iâ€™m not suggesting theyâ€™re angels.)  Colinâ€™s insulin use has decreased by 70% since the fall of 2008 when we left the home. His blood sugars are the most stable weâ€™ve seen. He still experiences sugar cravings but loves to make his vegetable stir-fry snack.(He has written about this experience on his blog.)  Weâ€™ve decided to continue with the no grain/no fruit for two more months. A three-month period makes sense because of the nature of healing and regeneration in the body.  Three months puts us at Halloween. A perfect time for a treat. Like a strawberry fruit smoothie.</div>  Is this what you saw, JeniB and others who\'ve done GAPS?  I\'ve been gearing up to give this a go; I think I will take a shot at this for myself and my dd with blood sugar issues.  She has me worried more than any of my kids right now.  This is encouraging that it has such a good effect on her son\'s diabetes.

' <div class=\"postbody\">It sounds like you found one of the \"good\" guys -- his having a child on the spectrum was probably his initial motivation, and gives him a special insight into the lives of his patients with autism.  Good info to pass along online!</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi!  We still give my son carconosin. I was about to switch and start trying the vaccine clearing remedies, but thankfully my homeopath convinced me to give it some more time. Our homeopath is Dr. Robert Ullman who is one of the leading homeopaths in the country and wrote the book A Drug-Free Approach to Autism and Asberger\'s. He explained it to me that you stick with a remedy as long as you keep seeing gains. Once the gains taper off, it is time to up to the next potency. You will know you have the right remedy because he will continue to show improvements small or large, but steadily. The time period between potencies will vary from person to person and even for each person from potency to potency. For example my son will stick with a potency for 3 weeks making gains before it will even out, sometimes longer or shorter. It helps to keep a journal to note any changes, good or bad. Your homeopath should schedule follow ups every 6-8 weeks. The notebook will come in handy when making decisions about changing potencies or remedies.  My son made great changes but the gibberish was still present and although he recovered in almost every area, language was still delayed. I started to get desperate and wanted to try a new remedy. Our homeopath explained that eventually you will get a potency which they call the sweet spot. It will be the right dose for your child and that is when you will see the big WOWs! This happened for us, this last potency. For chronic conditions like autism you generally need to stay on the remedy for about 1 year, sometimes longer depending on the severity. We usually stay on a potency for about 3-6 weeks before we up it, but it all depends on if your child is making steady growth. The longer you do it the more you will get a feel for when it is time to up it.     <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Nikosmom, I have been reading all of your posts and I am so happy for you about your son\'s progress. That is so amazing! I am just curious, how long did you have to give the carcinosin? Did you give other remedies also? And how long did it take to see major improvements, like talking? I know I probably need to just be patient because I know this isnt a quick process. Id appreciate it if you could give me some more info though! </div>  We are still giving him Carconisin. We saw lots of small but definite improvements with each potency (just like you described) until we hit the \"sweet spot\" potency. That was when language started to take off. We never gave any other remedies. Give it time and try to keep a daily journal of improvements or aggrivations. It is great to flip back through it and realize just how much progress is being made over time.   <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">we started homeopathy in july. our homeopath has given some medicines though we dont know their names.  small improvements are there but since we have also started b6, and also cilantro + garlic we do not know what is causing them</div>    Homeopaths treat chronic conditions differently than things like a cold or allergies. When my kids start getting sick I treat them with a homeopathy kit. This is different then the LM dosing they recieve for their chronic disorders. I would make sure your homeopath has experience with treating children with autism.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I posted about how happy I was that my younger sons blood work was all normal, and here I am freaking out about my oldest son.  He is not autistic, but has ADHD/ODD and a mood disorder that developed after his 7th grade boosters.  We have been doing biomed with our DAN for two years now since he had a SPECT scan that showed scalloping and severe hypoperfusion of the brain.  He\'s 17 years old and refuses to follow a diet, so I give him enzymes as much as I can.  He has improved tremendously since we started with our DAN (mood wise) but is still very sick and suffers from severe fatigue, has circles under his eyes so bad people think he\'s dying.  Since we started biomed we have discovered he has all the problems my oldest does (heavy metals, leaky gut, inflammation, etc.) and that he has food intolerances (32 of them) and hypothyroidism and lyme.  In February we started chelating and our DAN ran a CBC with diff at the time.  His iron levels were just barely over the top- range was 10-110, and his ferritin was at 116.  Now, at Thanksgiving his ferritin levels were 169 (I think, now I can\'t find the results).  He also had another blood thing that was elevated (hemo something..dang I wish I could find that paperwork) both times. His liver enzymes have been elevated for two years, although they have come down some since we\'ve been able to take him off of Seroquel and Lamictal. We have done IV\'s with him once a month February through May, and every two weeks since then.  Wouldn\'t that cause his iron to go down?  Instead it has risen.  We also got his red blood cell elements test back and he was very, very low in chromium, manganese and boron despite the fact that I\'m constantly cramming minerals down his throat to compensate for chelation.  Since we found out he had Lyme and hypothyroidism I\'ve chalked up his fatigue to that.  However, treatment for both has not helped his fatigue and aches and pains and frankly I feel like he\'s getting sicker. Anyone have any ideas on high iron, and low minerals and elevated liver enzymes (thinking now that might not be entirely due to meds)?  Any ideas at all would be appreciated.  Thanks!</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">My son will be starting Chelation soon &amp; we will be using the DMSA suppository method. We did a trial run before to test for metals &amp; it seem to give him a little tummy ache each time he had a bowel movement.

He didn\'t like the suppository &amp; neither did my husband &amp; I. The Doc suggested that this was the better route because of less side effects. Is this true? What have been your experiences?  Plus, we are having problems with him pooping on the potty. He can do it but is afraid to let it out. I\'m afraid the suppository will make this situation worse. Please chime in.</div>'

It\'s a delicate ecology in the gut. But as far as the SPD goes, you might see huge improvement virtually overnight in this with just adding a few things. MB12 nasal spray/sublingual (to bypass the gut, but start with maybe 250-500 mcg and work up) and I highly recommend a B complex transdermal cream (Lee Silsby makes a great one). And add good fats.

Bedtime has been so easy, and he\'s sleeping all night, for 12 hours!  Stimming is reduced, he\'s more able to focus on other things rather than seeking that continual sensory input.  Things like playing with me!  Talking has increased,  but I think that\'s more of him being able to calm down and focus on talking rather than attributing language gains to this supplement combo.    I\'m excited to see how he does when he returns to school (we\'ve been closed due to inclement weather down south here) Also, interested to see how speech therapy goes today.  His speech therapist has long said he has the language to talk, but is just too wrapped up in his sensory needs to get it out.  Other than probiotics and multi-vitamins, which we have used for a long time, these are the only supplments I\'ve yet added.  I think I\'ll give this a few weeks then chose the next supplement, so I can tell which exactly is having influence on him.  I\'m thinking carnosine.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mimi  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://cadesmom.wordpress.com/\">http://cadesmom.wordpress.com/</a><!-- m --></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mimi  http://cadesmom.wordpress.com/</div>'

I\'m gonna copy and paste my reply here.      <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">I already have NCD and NDF Plus. I was wondering if I just decided to chelate with those 2 products, would I still have to run any blood tests to check liver counts, e.t.c?</div>  I do think it\'s a good idea to do occasional liver enzyme tests to see if they are in normal ranges with any kind of detox. With DMSA, we did check the liver enzymes more often because the drugs are harder on the liver. With the NDF plus, we check, maybe once a year.  I think that if the liver enzymes have tested high before starting the NDF Plus/NCD, then you would want to check to make sure they are going down into normal ranges.  Are you currently using Liver Life? If not, I would strongly suggest starting that before incorporating the NCD or the NDF Plus. The Liver Life is really effective at helping to normalize liver enzymes, drain acids, restore a healthy pH, decongest the liver and kidneys and restore a healthy functioning liver. Liver Life enables the body to detox much more efficiently. <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">I thought I read that the natural chelators are gentler on the body so I wasn\'t sure if the blood work will be necessary (of course I would still do urine and stool to see what they are pulling).</div>  There are no side effects with NDF Plus unlike the drugs. You do want to ramp up slowly to avoid a \'healing crisis\' but since it\'s a whole food, dietary supplement your body will metabolize it as a food, not a drug.   <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Also, just to verify, NDF Plus does cross the blood brain barrier, correct?</div>    There are no objective studies to show that any ingredients in the  NDF\'s cross the blood brain barrier. We do know that the NDF Plus  raises both beta and theta waves (improves brain wave function)  within 5-113 minutes of ingestion. But this is subjective and does  not prove that metals are being removed but rather that brain  function is improved.      My best,  Tami    Hope this is helpful.

' <div class=\"postbody\">...Not on an empty stomach! I\'ve learned this lesson the hard way and I wanted to pass it on. Our second DAN has made some suggestions that have set us back. The first was FOS. It supercharged yeast and bad pathogen bacteria instead of colonizing good bacteria. It also gave us an eczema flair up that has not gone away, along with the bad bacteria behaviors that we had not seen for a while. This set us back weeks, if not months. We\'re still not over it.  The second suggestion is he insisted we always take our probiotics on an empty stomach, as do most of the probiotic manufacturers. In fairness to him, we were already doing this. The result is months and months of little to no good bacteria colonization and 0\'s on our CDSA for Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Clearly the billions of probiotics we were giving were DOA. Why? As you can imagine I have been very frustrated and depressed about it. On the surface, it would make sense to take probiotics on an empty stomach, but clearly this wasn\'t working.   How could this be?   I did a lot of digging to understand why my son kept showing little to no good bacteria. Now I know why. All of the probiotics are being killed in his empty stomach, IMO. I ended up finding one probiotic manufacturer(HLC/Pharmax) that suggested taking their probiotics with food. Why? That got me to dig further.   If you look at this study of stomach and duodenal pH here, we can establish:  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/41548/1/11095_2004_Article_305803.pdf\">http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream ... 305803.pdf</a><!-- m -->   <span style=\"color: #BF0000\">1. The median fasting pH( <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH</a><!-- m --> ) in the stomach is very acidic at 1.7. That would likely kill all, if not almost all of the probotics in a capsule. 2. With the arrival of the first food, the pH at the duodenum(the opening of the small intestine) has a brief drop in pH, suggesting a quick and brief influx of acid. 3. Within a few minutes of food, the pH in the stomach rises to up to the 4-6 range, much less acidic, but still mildly acidic. It starts to drop again around 15 minutes in. 4. Within the first few minutes of food, the pH in the duodenum drops mildly to the 4-5 range, but quickly rebounds. Figure 4 in the study clearly shows when the safest time to deliver probiotics is. The best time would be a few minutes after starting to eat, when the stomach acid is buffered and the pH is raised to a more survivable environment. My theory is that if they are given, say 5-10 minutes into a meal, the acid is buffered by the food, the pH is raised and the probiotic capsules should make into the small intestine at the very least. My other thought is having food in front of and behind it should help buffer more acid and escort the capsules deeper.</span>  Therefore, our new strategy will be to give probiotics only with food, within the first 5-10 minutes of a meal, without digestive enzymes. I believe this will work and the next CDSA will prove it.  I believe we have clearly established with my son that probiotics won\'t make it out of the stomach. The pH study above also supports this. You know the saying...&quot;if you keep doing the same things, don\'t expect a different result&quot;.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Parent of  7 YO PDD-NOS 5 YO NT</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Parent of  7 YO PDD-NOS 5 YO NT</div>'

I would call some homeopaths in your area and ask if they do vaccine remedies. It is a non-traditional method so alot of homeopaths don\'t do it but I have found even if they don\'t agree with the method they don\'t mind letting you try since there is no side effects or harm in trying.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi,  Some signs of high glutamate include more stims/irritability/insomnia...oversensitivity to sounds,sights, poor eye contact.  While higher than average levels of glutamate are implicated in increased learning and memory(the fact that you can read this post proves that you are using glutamate), excessive amounts overexcite the neurons.  If in excess, the glutamate causes an ion channel to open in the neuron which is then fired by calcium.  Under normal conditions, this is fine and the ion channel is closed after the impulse is given.  However, in an excitotoxic  situation the channel doesn\'t close and the constantly open channel  continues to let in calcium which can then damage/kill the neuron.  So, excessive glutamate acts as an excitotoxin.  Interestingly enough, this is the situation in patients who have suffered a stroke, oxygen deprived or suffered brain damage as a result of head trauma.  There is evidence suggesting that autistic children have an excess of glutamate receptors, particularly NMDA type receptors.  If glutamate is in excess, you will want to limit calcium and promote the closing of that channel.  Magnesium closes it on a temporary basis whereas zinc(but not too much(zinc&lt;40/mg/day)...cause it can also excite NMDA receptors if in excess) can do it on a longer term basis.  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/16/4/157\">http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/ ... l/16/4/157</a><!-- m -->  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=bon82046\">http://content.karger.com/produktedb/pr ... e=bon82046</a><!-- m -->  Gaba is the calming opponent(inhibitory neurotransmitter) to glutamate;kinda like a person\'s brakes like in a car.  It is important to speech as well; it is said to put the spaces between our words.  If Gaba is either insufficient or dysregulated, you cannot focus on one thing.  If Gaba receptors are not \'occupied\' by Gaba, \'wild\' signals bombard the individual.  It is not unlike being at a loud discotech and trying listen to someone whispering to you.  Rather than a qualitative test, you should strive to get the amino acids test done where you see the quantitative  levels.  Try Genova, Doctors Data, Metametrix...and then, strive for consistency in follow-ups by using the same lab.  As far as the pedialyte is concerned, I don\'t think that this is the best option.  It is an electrolyte drink containing  undesirable things.  There must be some quality alternative that your doc can prescribe as an addition to the diet so that risk of hypoglycemia is minimized.</div>'

When we stop, he is normal and then gradually gets worse again. On yeast meds, he\'s not so good the entire time, there\'s no \"die-off\" period for us, just off and on bad and good. It has to be for us a metabolic thing....Can you say, rock....hard place! Anyway, how far up do you have to go while taking it? And what happens when you reach the maximum dose?

' <div class=\"postbody\">Anybody have experience with this one?  I found an old post that talked about it, but not sure what anybody\'s responses were?  We just started our son on it three days ago and he is definitely a responder.  Some of it is good and some of it is bad, but it\'s working for sure. The bad:  He\'s hyper, hyper, hyper!  I read that is a side effect that will disappear in a couple weeks so we will push on.  His teacher is going to hate me.  The OCD is still in check for the most part except he\'s making his blowing noises again. He absolutely will not sit still or be quiet!  He\'s back to touching things, but now it\'s only to label them. He\'s labeling everything and echoing everything he hears.  Also odd, he began sucking on his finger tonight.  I\'ve seen him bite his nails before but sucking on his finger is definitely a first. The good:  He wont be quiet!  He\'s labeling everything in site.  After he labeled my &quot;shirt, belt, pants&quot; for the fiftieth time during a movie tonight I told him to be quiet so we could watch our movie, and to put his hands down.  I told him, &quot;No more shirt, belt, pants for now&quot;.  He teared up and said to me, &quot;Not nice&quot;.  Then he cried and buried his head in my shirt.  He said over and over again &quot;I\'m so sad, I\'m so sad, I\'m so sad&quot;.  WOW!  Ok, so I felt like an ogre then.  He\'s never said &quot;Not nice&quot; or &quot;I\'m so sad&quot; EVER before.  yes, that is all new.  He also was thrilled to see his friends (sons of my friend).  He imitated everything they did last night and smiled so big and laughed when he saw them. He is also kissing me constantly and hugging me.  I\'m thrilled with that one! We had friends over last night and he talked constantly.  They said they had never seen him say so much, and I never told them about the GalantaMind.  Last night we ate out and he refused to eat.  I asked what he wanted and he said, &quot;I pray&quot;.  He closed his eyes and said &quot;Love you Jesus, Amen&quot;.  Okay, also a big first!  Then today he was singing &quot;Jesus loves me&quot; in between his blowing noises while working a puzzle.  All of these are firsts.  He can label words in picture books but doesn\'t do so spontaneously, or didn\'t until now.  In the last month we\'ve worked on &quot;I want&quot; before he says what he wants (limited to drink, candy, or train because that\'s all he ever wants).  But at dinner he told me &quot;I want bread&quot; while pointing to my bread. I am amazed at how quickly he has responded and is talking up a blue streak, but he is so hyper with a capital H.  He\'s not agitated though, which is good, and his sleep hasn\'t been affected by it.  Him telling me &quot;not nice&quot; and &quot;I\'m so sad&quot;.....priceless.  Does that mean we\'ve reached a new level in noticing and expressing emotions?  I\'ll deal with the hyper for awhile and see what else we get! Much thanks to Recoveringnicholas who recommended this.  I am not disappointed!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">DMSA chelation does not deplete Mg and Ca per se.  If you look at the chemistry of MgS and CaS solid, they decompose into free Mg, and Ca cations and generate H2S gas as soon as they meets with water.  On the other hand, sulfide ion reacts with Zinc to precipitate ZnS.  This means DMSA chelates Zinc in the body.  Mg is needed to produce glutathione.  By increasing Mg, you boost the production of glutathione.  The increased glutathione reduces the stress caused by something else (bacteria, virus, etc).  Based on my son\'s experience, it\'ll gradually lose its efficacy.  <div class=\"quotetitle\">fontanalucy wrote:</div><div class=\"quotecontent\">We had an episode just like you describe with our daughter during round 11 (I believe) of AC chelation.

We just got the test results back and it was not strep related.  Now I\'m positive it was magnesium deficiency because the symptoms are very similar to PANDAS, she has had two of those episodes one during a round and another one a day after a round and the only thing that helped her calm down was the magnesium cream and liquid magnesium.  I increased her magnesium dose on and off round and that has helped so much, she\'s really much calmer and the anxiety is GONE!  I did try adrenergize but it did not help her at all.</div></div>'

I am just so proud, and since I have an *older* child (a few weeks shy of 9) I feel it is important to let everyone with tough nuts or older kids know that it IS possible to make gains, get words, and take academic leaps forward.    2 stories:    Last night he laid in my arms, this hypersensitive child who finally hugged me last weekend, last night sat on the couch beside me.  He leaned in, set his head in my lap, wrapped his arms around me and looked up at me with his angel eyes and a sweet innocent smile.  He kept looking at me, then he would pull my head down so he could kiss me, he did the over and over.  He even rubbed noses (eskimo kisses).  All FROM him, not prompted by me in any way.  He laid in my arms for the longest time, it was reminicent of holding him as a baby, you know, craddled in my arms.  I cried.      Today:    After school I picked him up in his classroom, he saw me standing outside the door.  He walked over to me and said, \"Mama, Bye Bye\"  I flipped!  I asked the aid, \"Did you hear him?!!!\"  We use the term bye-bye when we are leaving, ie: Let\'s go bye bye.  So he was acknowledging me and telling me he was ready to go!!

As I haven\'t found any evidence of the DAN chelation protocol using ALA, and he isn\'t familiar with Cutler\'s, which of course does use ALA, all I can think is that he just doesn\'t know it has chelating properties. I can\'t stress enough how thorough and knowledgable our doctor (who is actually a D.O.) has been up until this issue, so the fact that we\'ve hit this major bump in the road is surprising. Obviously this will be discussed at our next appointment, and as a result I may just do our own thing with chelation. We\'re starting NDF+ very soon, so hopeful about those results.    I do have another question -- williams_dad mentioned that because ALA burns the throat when opened from the capsule, his DAN doesn\'t recommend it.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Aisha,  I don\'t think SCD would be anymore overwhelming for one child versus 2, but making the switch can be overwhelming.  There are two ways to look at diet a - keeping the bad stuff out and b - getting the right nutrients in.  You can start SCD by keeping the bad stuff out.  You can buy antibiotic/steroid free meats and wash all the pesticides from fruits veggies w/ a wash.  When you are ready you can take the turn to grass fed and pastured meats and eggs.  This does add an expense but you do get a nutritious bang for your buck.    In the beginning of SCD you should cook down fruits/veggies so they are easier to digest.  However these don\'t need to be eaten in this form.  I used to mix pear sauce with ground pork/beef for sausages, mashed carrot or string beans mixed with beef for a hamburger.  We ate LOTS of meat patties in the beginning.  Once you are a month or so in (depending on their digestive health) you can start introducing well cooked but not pureed stuff.  If memory serves you can give well cooked carrots in the beginning (it doesn\'t all need to be pureed).  If your boys can have eggs, that is a relatively easy meal and you can eat as much as you want in the beginning.      In the beginning there really isn\'t too much you can buy from the store.  Now I buy organic frozen berries and those are an \"easy\" snack.  The first month will be the toughest b/c it is when you are most limited.  Snacks in the beginnng were applesauce, bananas, homeade Jello and ice pops.  Once we added nut butters I started making the Cashew Butter muffins which continue to be a great snack.  The intro (2 days max) and the stage 1 will be the toughest but once you get through that you should notice your boys being open to more textures and hence different foods.      (a summary from Nourishing Hope)  An oxalate is a salt of oxalic acid that binds to certain minerals such as calcium at which point an oxalate crystal is created.  These can be damaging moreso to those with leaky gut.  If these are absorbed at high levels they can end up in the blood, urine and tissue.  Once they are are in the tissue they can create inflammation on pain.      High oxalate food includes Spinach, nuts and seeds, most berries (if you search oxalates on this site I believe someone had included a long list a while back).      A low oxalate diet is good to try for urinary problems, GI or other pain within minutes/hours after eating, craving high oxalate food, continued constipation/diarrhea or gas not relieved by other diets.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to Rosie, 7yrs - ASD Long Island, NY</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to Rosie, 7yrs - ASD Long Island, NY</div>'

We also have been rotating from Diflucan to natural antifungals like GFSE, Pau D\'Arco, and most recently Oregano and back to Ketaconizole. We\'ve kept Nystatin constant.

' <div class=\"postbody\">What are the problem behaviors?    I\'ve noticed that whenever I see good gains with my boy, he also starts to act out more.  He sort of missed out on terrible 2s, so I supposed they\'re due whenever he starts feeling better.  Every time we have a marked improvement, we first have to deal with tantrums and aggression.  Every-time.  So I\'ve learned to look at these behaviors in a positive light.  \"Oh, he pushed his sister!  Well, that\'s peer interaction!  So yay!\"      Cod liver oil increases brain activity, so being more aware of the things he is taking in might also make him more aware of the things he doesn\'t like.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello Aisha,    Yes my son is now talking in pretty much complete sentences (ranging from about 3 to 12 words).  He\'s using \"I\" now for 75% of the time where he used to use \"me\" all the time.  However, he does speak and it is understandable by most people, it is still not perfectly clear yet (some words are and others are pretty close).  He has severe apraxia (well I guess we are prob moderate now).  He still has trouble with \"s\" and \"f\", however he can use them on certain words and not others.      The first thing that we started in the beginning was <span style=\"color: darkblue\">enzymes</span> by houston neutraceuticals.  He begin to babble slowly.  This was around 3.5 yrs old.  We then added culturelle next and still was babbling more.      A couple months later we added in <span style=\"color: darkblue\">MB12</span> (Jan 2007).  This was a BIGGIE for us or should I say WOW!!!  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" />   He started to babble more and was beginning to start to say words (or with his apraxia I should say parts of words).  MB12 we saw both receptive and expressive gains.  I have to say the MB12 seemed like it was waking up his tongue.  We started off with every three days, then went to daily for a few months but was making him super hyper and now are at every other day which seems perfect.    Since then we have tried lots and lots of things for both his speech and hyperness.  I would have to we definitely saw an improvement in speech with the following:    <span style=\"color: darkblue\">LDN</span> (however made him hyper, but would like to try this again at a later date)    <span style=\"color: darkblue\">Coromega</span> (gave 2 packs a day and just bumped it up to 3 a few weeks ago)    <span style=\"color: darkblue\">Ketoconazole</span> (everytime we use this his speech improves - he uses other antifungals, but this is the one we see the most with)    <span style=\"color: darkblue\">Glutathione cream</span> (prescription - better speech the higher dose, but makes him hyper - takes 2 ml twice a day instead of the prescribed 5ml.)    <span style=\"color: darkblue\">Valtrex </span>(sentence structure improved greatly with this)    <span style=\"color: darkblue\">Chelation</span> (this will be our 7th week of chelating and we have definitely noticed an improvement in speech, both in sentence structure and clarity)    <span style=\"color: darkblue\">Liver Life</span> (improvement all around)    <span style=\"color: darkblue\">DMG </span>(language is very good - however he can not take this b/c even a sprinkle sets him off the wall)    <span style=\"color: darkblue\">Monavie</span> (I believe this has helped a little with speech - it has coincided with many other things, but even though it is expensive I do believe it is helping him)    Our Dan Doctor really believes that Micks speech will clear up with the chelation and with HBOT.  We have caved in and decided to do HBOT and will be starting in a couple of weeks.      Mick is also having a colonoscopy and endoscopy done on Oct.2  by Dr. Buie.  He believes treating the GI will help him also.  Mick is not absorbing the supplements correctly - for some he is on triple the dose.  So hopefully once we get this corrected, we can decrease a lot of the supplements.    I have to be honest that I really did not think he would ever talk.  Writing this to you really shows me how much he has improved and how close we are getting there.  Is your son babbling at all yet?  Please don\'t give up hope.  It has been a looooonnnggg road and still have ways to go, but each day look at how much progress he is making and you will know he will get better.  I laugh as I tell you this b/c there are so many days that I come on here looking for support because Mick has had a really bad day.

' <div class=\"postbody\">have you tried benfothiamine for brain barrier? this helped big time here, since we have arsenic. Is there a chance you have arsenic? this breaks down cell walls. DMSA pulls arsenic but arsenic depletes thiamine which is what makes stomach acid to fight infection. Kids with really low thiamine showed mental decline and rise in bacterial infections. if you had high arsenic being pulled this can explain the strep flair. But you need ot get arsenic out to prevent more bacterial infections. Arsenic lowers netrophils and too much DMSa can cause netrophilia. I think it\'s pull on arsenic will trigger this. Thiamine is the main B vitamin for forming the blood brain barrier. Read some of doglover\'s post on another thread. it clicked with me and some issues we have. My dog before getting very ill, had an ear infection we could not get rid of, lots of fungal infection. I think we all have been exposed and are showing gut problems too.   Glad that IVIG seems to be helping though. It\'s something in the back of my head incase I feel it\'s necessary. Do you think that IVIG will work temporarily and that if metals are still in there the same thing could happen again later down the road?

' <div class=\"postbody\">After 2 sets of Vermox (three days each), my son is having the BEST days that I can remember in awhile.  His cheeks are filling out--started noticing a difference in maybe two days.  His expressive language is great, he\'s engaging others, his play is appropriate for his age (11), and most surprising, he had wheat cake and cheap junk ice cream at a party yesterday and I am not seeing any effects at all.  He is as normal as the day is long.      Could this possibly be due to getting rid of parasites??    I am dumbfounded, and upset to say the least.  It\'s possible that this new level of healing is due to something else, or is one of those great periods that appear out of nowhere and then go away (we\'ve had many of those), but I was hoping someone on this board could comment... has anyone seen huge gains by beating back parasites?    My son has had two stool cultures over the several years we\'ve been seeing a DAN, have not had parasites show up in either, and this is the first time we have treated for them.  After the discussions about how they do not necessarily show up, and how they hide in soft tissue, I am feeling sick wondering if parasites have been a huge problem for a long time, and maybe all his life.  As I think back, there are a lot of pieces that fit that scenario, right back to his infancy.  He always, always has been WAY too thin--it has been a lifelong fight to keep weight on this boy, and that\'s the major reason we had to abandon the SCD and some other diet interventions we\'ve worked on over the years.  He would just look skeletal after a short time, and I would have to revert to things he reacted to but would eat in large quantity.  Also, he was born in a home that we bought as a fixer-upper, and were still in the early stages of working on--and the family had 15 animals that trashed it before we bought it.  Not looking like such a bargain to me right now. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" />     Nobody ever checked for parasites, or even suggested them.  They just weren\'t even on my radar screen.      I have also added in, just this week, vitamin E and borage oil.  Couldn\'t find the ProEFA yet.  His Liver Life, after beginning a couple of weeks ago, is up to just six drops daily, so I can\'t imagine that is causing such a gain.  It just has to be the Vermox.  Does Vermox do anything else important besides kill parasites?    Here\'s that tricky part we\'ve been talking about on other boards--I guess now I just have to wait and see if there\'s a regression about the time the new eggs would hatch (Yuck!!!  This is just making me crazy!!).</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">So far today he has had 3 doses and is doing fine.  What should I look for ?  The RX is in capsul form and I just open them and mix with juice or something and give him orally with a dropper.  It is C-Nystatin 500,000 IU.  That what it says on the bottle and I\'m directed to give him 2 capsules by mouth, four times daily.      His arabinose was slightly elivated - I think the range was 0-47, and his was 51.05.  This was the only yeast issue that came back.  Everything else was fine.  He\'s also on a probiotic twice a day for high bad bacterial growth.      We have been on a low-sugar diet and was using Diflucan since the end of November.  We noticed no behavioral changes or regression with the Diflucan, thus the DAN\'s recommendation to try Nystatin.  I\'m guessing maybe the yeast really isn\'t an issue for him - possibly.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mybuddy12</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mybuddy12</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Dana,  Sorry it took so long to get back, my husband is working today and Jessica is \"doing the dishes\" at the kitchen sink.  I should take a picture and when she\'s a teenager and I can\'t get her to do anything, show her the picture of when she wanted to be a little helper.  She probably has water all over the floor but she\'s having so much fun.  Who cares?    The NCD with LL is such a great combination!  I\'m seeing new things both kids are doing everyday, just little things like taking the iniciative to do something they wouldn\'t have thought of before.  Usually, when they wake up in the morning (if it\'s not a school dayand I wake them up) they both would just lay in their bed and start talking and making noise until the other wakes up.  Then they both start talking and making noise until I wake up and go in their room.  That\'s how it\'s been since they got their big kid beds.  This is what they\'ve done also when waking up from their nap, just lay in the bed and talk and make noise until I come in their room.    Now, when they wake up whichever one wakes up first it doesn\'t matter, both of them are coming out of their room on their own.  There are so many other examples of abstract/critical thinking going on.  In the middle of dinner, Jessica could all the sudden realize she misses her daddy (he\'s been working so much lately)  and start crying.  She\'s NEVER displayed any type of missing someone when they\'re gone.  They both have recently been going through separation anxiety, they never went through this as toddler\'s.  I could drop them off anywhere no crying or anything.  Now I\'m dealing with Jessica tantruming when daddy or mema leaves.  So I guess it\'s a good thing really.  She doesn\'t have any transition tantrums anymore, they\'ve pretty much gone away unless she\'s having  a chelation regression and then it\'s only temporary.  Instead of coming to me, taking my hand and dragging me to what he wants, Luke is looking at me telling me what he wants.  His eye contact has always been poor, but now he looks at me and WANTS my ATTENTION.  He\'s never really cared whether or not I\'m giving him my attention, but now it seems like they\'re in competition for it!  They\'re both just displaying more and more typical behavior everyday.  I\'m so happy but I hope I\'ll be able to live through it if you kwim! Right now, they\'re both grabbing on my arms trying to get into my lap.  They want to go outside and play, I thought it was going to rain but now the suns out.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi all. Well I just wanted to post this and see what others would say. I have been doing biomed for awhile now, though havent seen any HUGE improvements, but have seen many smaller ones. Recently with starting Liverlife I have seen some improvements like my son being calmer (some of the time), and OSR, which has made my son hyper/irritable at times but I think I am seeing some small improvements also.  But my husband isnt really as into biomed as I am and he seems to just get irritated when something I give our son makes him irritable/hyper. I keep trying to remind him that it will all be worth it in the end, but I dont think he is looking at the bigger picture.. He is just more negative and thinks our son will never improve and doesnt want to deal with any negative effects of biomed.    Anyway, I think he is stressed out with our situation.. He usually is sweet to our son, but the other day he was telling him to get away when zach was just trying to be sweet. I had never seen him do this before. I think he is getting really frustrated with the way things are at this point and he just doesnt want to believe that biomed is going to be the thing to help our son. He is at least pretty open to me trying new things, up to a point.. If I start spending alot of money on supplements, he gets kind of annoyed with that! lol  He did say that hed be willing to do IV chelation... we\'ll see if he means it...     Anyway I just wanted to see if anyone else is in this same type of situation.. I seem to be the only one in my family who actually thinks biomed treatments are actually going to help him...It does take alot of faith to keep up with it when you are not seeing huge gains, just small, steady ones..  My mom is a little more open to it but I dont know if she is a full believer in it..

' <div class=\"postbody\">If you are concerned then I would  do separate baths as the skin is the largest organ  of the body.(It does soak up as well as release toxins. ) Btw we used to use 1/2  cup of baking soda along with 1 cup of  Epson salt  Very relaxing  good luck   Kenny V    Her is short exert on Epsom salt baths   â€“ Most people use about one to two cups per tub. Dissolve the salts in hot water first and then fill the tub to about waist deep, as warm as possible. The amount of salts you may find works best will depend on the individual tolerance, the temperature of the water, and the size of the tub. The warmer the water and larger the tub, the more salts will dissolve. If you see negative reactions, such as irritability or hyperactivity, then decrease the amount of salts. You may need to start with as little as one tablespoon of salts, and work up gradually. Epsom salts baths are very calming for most people. This works well just before bedtime. Most guides say to soak for about 20 minutes or more. It is okay to let the salts dry on the skin. You may notice a dry clear-white powder. If it is too itchy or irritating, just rinse it off. If the skin feels too dry, use lotion or oils to moisturize. Diarrhea or loose stools may result if children drink the bath water.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Always Hope For Recovery</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Always Hope For Recovery</div>'

We were also doing Valtrex at the same time and that also helped.  The very first stool test showed a high level of strep and the second stool test done several months later after we removed the strep strains indicated there wasn\'t any strep in her poop anymore.      The Klaire probiotics were helpful to her.  She didn\'t have a high number of good bacteria in her first stool test.  However, after doing the Klaire probiotics (minus the strep) for a few months she had 4+ levels of several strains of beneficial bacteria.   I give two probiotic capsules at night.

I believe some children do recover without chelation but only because through MB12 shots or antivirals or some other biomedical treatment their detoxification systems are working properly again and they\'re excreting toxins from their bodies.    There was a mom who posted on this board a few months ago that she has talked to many parents with recovered children and those kids who were heavy metal toxic and not chelated later turned out to have anger management issues in their teen years.

' <div class=\"postbody\">For any of you using the Cutler protocol, did anyone just do it on their own?  I have the book, and it looks so correct and sensible.  I believe you can buy all the components without an Rx.  If we went REAL slow, would it be ok to just go it alone?    We have a DAN doctor, and I am not sure if I want to approach her with the idea of doing things \"Andy\'s way\" instead of using the things I know she routinely uses (c-EDTA, etc.) that Andy calls out as being harmful.  My son had a mouthful of metal amalgams, so I am fairly sure there\'s some metal to be rid of.  I did get the French porphryn (sp?) test; I could post the results here; my doctor did not seem to think the numbers were high enough to warrant jumping right into chelation, though the test commentary said the numbers did show issues with metals.    Any thoughts on the safety of the Cutler protocol would be welcomed.  I also think my youngest might benefit as well, though she is \"only\" ADHD and not officially on the spectrum.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi, I wanted to post that I\'ve been digging around in nutrition books for awhile now and have been reading about food combining.  It is a very old concept.  It isn\'t really complicated, just that you don\'t eat grains and proteins at the same meal, as they will not digest well.  You also do not eat fruits with anything--you eat them alone.  Vegetables are fine with anything.  We have been doing this for maybe 6 months now, and it has made a huge difference with my own ability to digest foods, with my dd\'s tummy aches and also with constipation overall.    We follow a hypoglycemia diet, and what this looks like for us is protein in the morning and noon, with very little or no grain at those meals.  Lunch is the meal where it seem to matter least.  It has really helped at dinner to eat mostly just grains and veggies--heavy on the veggies--and then just a little meat at dinner.    And we eat fruit alone, about 2 hours after meals, for snacks.  The sugar will mess up digestion when eaten with other foods, but alone it is digested quickly and will not cause the problems with yeast and such that it will otherwise, and will not ferment the food in the gut.  This has made it possible for my kids to have melon, bananas and pears for snacks regularly.  We are no longer avoiding fruit, and I am more comfortable nutritionally now because of it.    This was, for us, more  of a &quot;tweak&quot; to our diet and not an overhaul.  If you can\'t do it for one meal, no big deal--just try to do it the next time.  No pressure, which helps me.  The SCD killed me in that way--I felt the sky was falling if we had to eat out or whatever and we got off diet!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

Not sure if it\'s a detox reaction or really just a coincidence but we are not giving him anything at this point.  He\'s been home from school since Thursday, laying on the couch, puking, being lethargic.  Hasn\'t eaten much (2 small meals) since Wednesday night.

Many parents on the NCD yahoo group have reported cold/flu like symptoms.    With L and J, I worked up to 6 drops 2x per day in the beginning and Luke had terrible cold/flu/fever reaction.  His nose was running like crazy. J really didn\'t have much of a reaction only more echolalia than usual.   I lowered the dose down to 3 drops 2x per day and that\'s pretty much where we\'ve been since then.     I\'m using the NCD as redistribution prevention for the most part.

Also, it would be important that they are not having to remove or replace an amalgam in order to fill the new cavity.      The doctors who are knowledgeable in this area will know what to do if you need to have dental work done.  Also, there are windows of development for your child during which you would not want to have anything done; I think these developmental periods should be \"findable\" on the internet.  Or maybe ARI could help you out.  Somebody has a book, I think, on managing a pregnancy in order to avoid problems.      Don\'t worry--somebody has already thought this through!  We\'ll just have to find out who, and where they put the info.

One of the things they noted was that it was really important to fix the gut first, get the supplements and enzymes working, do MB12, then get going on HBOT, perhaps some IV glutathione and lastly do chelation.  I am just wondering if your DAN has tackled other issues your child may have prior to jumping head long into Hbot...  Lots of people were doing a big heavy sigh of frustration at the DAN conference over this, they had tried HBOT for like 200 hours, but they weren\'t doing anything else (ie: no mb12, no supps, no enzymes etc).</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I\'d do just DMSA for a few months. Mostly because you want to get body burden down first and then think about getting what\'s in the brain out. Many kids have lots of lead and other metals as well besides mercury.   It\'s important to use the supports on round. Vitamin C and E are very protecting from the metals moving around and being escorted out. Protects from organ and other damage that is possible. Don\'t worry too much about one round causing trouble at that low of a dose. Just next time, have all the supports in place. Yeast will definitely hide any gains you might get. So treat that.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Jen (mom of 3)  <strong><span style=\"color: #00BF00\">iherb referral code: HOF516</span></strong> <em>save $5 on first purchase</em></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Jen (mom of 3)  iherb referral code: HOF516</div>'

It neutralizes stomach acid, and stomach acid is a major protection against the growth of pathenogenic organisms. Please do not give him baking soda. Baking soda in a bath, though, is awesome as it neutralizes blood acidity through the skin. You want the blood to be slightly alkaline. You want the gut to be slightly acidic. This is critical for the body\'s ability to fight pathogens and for nearly every body function.   For reflux liver support has been the best thing, in combination with GAPS diet/getting pathogens down, and really helped her to be able to sleep. She would wake up in the middle of the night and not be able to return to sleep because when your body is detoxing a lot in the middle of the night, this is what happens. I find this also true when we are mineral deficient (as this affects the body\'s ability to detox... and also a low stomach acid environment interferes with mineral absorption.)

Is it  clearly doing ? Regardless of what the test and doc says   Has it ever helped? Did I ever see a reaction from it?     IMO you have to go back make sense of this before proceeding further.  You mention allot  â€œbig guns hereâ€  (stuff that doc is prescribing) and if you donâ€™t isolate what caused the change most likely  he is going to give you more stuff or tell you to drop last one but you may not ever isolate the real culprit.

' <div class=\"postbody\">This is why raw butter from grass fed cows is so good for our kids. It has all the minerals and vitamin K (which is needed to absorb any calcium). In supplement form, our bodies have a hard time processing it and using it correctly. If you give a calcium supplement to a child with gut dysbosis (where the bio-available form of vitamin K comes from) then you\'ll have excess unavailable calcium forming calcium crystals (oxalates) in the soft tissues and not in the bones. The form of calcium in greens is very hard for young children to use also. Maybe consider the x-factor butter oil that has no casein in it. This along with the codliver oil together is very good for mineral absorption. VSL #3 has been proven to help reduce oxalates (combo of bacteria I imagine helps the body break calcium down and use affectively in the gut). Zinc and calcium compete, I don\'t think mag competes with zinc. I don\'t know why they put them all together in supplements. Many doctors just don\'t know enough about nutrition unfortunately, even the good ones. A nutritionist may help more.

Sometimes someone will make a comment like \"isn\'t that a lot of work?\" to which I will usually respond \"yes, but it is helping him so much that it is totally worth it\".    Unfortunately, we have had to change our pediatrician because he was not supportive of it at all.  We consulted with another pediatrician (who, although is not a DAN doctor, had knowledge of biomedical) to get started, and when we told our regular pediatrician about it, he got upset and said that if we were going to use the other pediatrician for that, then he could just take our son as his patient totally.  Thankfully, it worked out that the new ped. could take him.      We also had some negative remarks from an ABA therapist.  Apparently, she  knew of a parent who had started their child on the GFCF diet and the child got so sick, she had to be hospitalized.  I\'ve never heard of any other child getting sick from taking gluten and casein out of their diet, so I can\'t help but wonder if maybe the child got a virus or something right at the same time she started the diet.

My husband said that Cam\'s teacher said \"Did he just ask you to unzip his jacket .. because inside .. I could have sworn he just said something like zip it zip it ...\" (and then I guess she looked kind of embarrased for saying it because my son is non-verbal and that would be stupid to possibly think he\'d say something like that.  (She was kind of shaking her head like - nahhh couldn\'t be).  And my husband said \"Hey if that\'s what you heard, I believe it .. he has been saying a lot of little things under his breath lately and we have seen this kind of stuff lately\".  In his communication book today she wrote \"Very lovey dovey and silly today\" .. she also verbally told my husband he had an \"excellent day and was very endearing and just perfect ... awesome day\" ...  Two weeks ago we were getting data on  number of aggressions each day .. they even had to call in some behavior specialist to help them out ... now ... nothing .. no aggressions at all.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thanks so much for your reply, Tami. It\'s amazing how you find the time to respond to every single post concering LiverLife in so much detail!    To answer your question. I never quite tracked my son\'s urine pH that closely. When his CSA showed an acidic stool pH, I bought a test kit at the local Vitamin Shoppe (manufacturer is Test Medica, product is called Acid Balance pH Monitor). I remember someone (perhaps our DAN) saying you want to get the morning pH up to the 6.5 - 7.0 range. We never quite accomplished that till we started him on LL, although I must admit I didn\'t test him for 2 months prior to the LL (so it\'s possible something else like the MB12 could\'ve caused his pH to increase).    Anyhow, we\'ll hold off on the NDF+ as you suggested. Today I gave him his LL along with his afternoon supplement cocktail. Will continue to monitor his pH...    Thanks again.</div>'

It wipes out the clostridia completely, but all the extra gut space it leaves can kick up some nasty yeast, so have some support in place. You do need to get the Vanco compunded, as the pill only treats the upper intestine vs the lower, I may have this reversed <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" />   Also, make sure you have some naturals in the system, like Capryllic acid and Molybedum while on this.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Oh, dear.  That sounds as if he\'s allergic to something in the powder.  Try leaving it off and giving some Benadryl (long before he has to be awake).  See if that helps.      It\'s probably not a reaction to the Nystatin itself -- it\'s probably a reaction to whatever base it is in.  You may want to try leaving off Nystatin and giving GSE/Probiotics for a while to see if everything stays level.  It may be that you can control the yeast without prescription drugs (preferable and possible with some kids).  If you get another flare up that GSE doesn\'t seem to handle, you can try 2 products from Kirkman -- one is Yeast Aid (which has worked very well for us) and another is Saccharomyces Boulardii -- which has been shown to be a very effective yeast killer.    Remember to give your probiotics apart from these yeast killing agents as they will probably also kill the probiotics.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</div>'

The peanut butter is great because its distinctive taste masks the taste of the DMSA (anything with sulfur will taste and smell strongly) and, in addition, it is gooey ... so it binds the powdered DMSA (or any other supplement) very well.

I think I paid 18.97 for 2oz.  I\'m going to use it on my son and daughter two days before the next full moon(that\'s when the parasites lay there eggs) which will be March 10th.  I\'m hoping this will help my son not be hungry all the time.  I had them one time after doing Dr. Natura colonics program.  I couldn\'t believe it!!  I know my children probably have them too.  EEHHHHH!! Anyway, I hope my son does well when I treat for parasites too.

' <div class=\"postbody\">i just want to say hang in there. When things started to turn around you will feel much better... I was one of the lucky one to see immediate changes with diet. But stimming, attention, social deficits are still very much present. Biggest change so far with ac chelation, improving her short term memory and general processing. It is good that you can afford ABA as i am a believer in good traditional therapies too, granted we can afford t hire good therapist. ABA helped my DD to gain lots of good skill. Teaching skill in break down steps are great and i use the same technique to my nt daughter now. If I can afford ABA again i would love to restart again. I am hoping that you will see result soon. Take a breath and slow down but please don\'t stop.. We are here to encourage one another.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Sleep was our Holy Grail for about 8 years as I recall.  IF I can recall--those years are a blur.  When my NT dd was about 5, and my son was in the thick of sickness, she asked me, &quot;Mommy, why don\'t you and Daddy ever smile?&quot;  After my son recovers, I will smile when he runs through the house with a bunch of friends, even if they break a lamp.  I will cheer when he gets a C, or even a D, in a regular algebra class.  He\'ll want to try things on his own, to learn on his own, experience life on his own without me sitting across the table making him do it.  I will look forward to spending my days on nothing more mentally taxing than cooking and cleaning and making sure there\'s shampoo in everyone\'s bathroom.  I won\'t spend my days poring over medical articles, or all my money on new supplements and treatments.  Mostly I\'ll be content to have the life I once thought would be so boring when I was young and ignorant--just a regular life.  And there will be lots of smiles in our home.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

We have seen improvement with CLO with vitamin A (not all have A) and Bethanecol. He got sick and refused all supps and the behavior got worse again. Mary Megson has some interesting stuff on Vitamin A and Bethanecol if you google her. She thinks it is important to use a natural source of A. Kirkman\'s, Garden of Life and Blue Ice High Vitamin CLO are natural. Some CLO remove the natural A and add in synthetic. I found an A from CLO without the CLO.

My son never had the ridigity about roads, but the anxiety was really hard.  He would get really upset if someone came to our house and cry and say no at the top of the stairs.  Anytime we went to someone house or grandparents he  would cry and scream because he thought we were leaving him.   It will get better....  He doesn\'t do it anymore and actually ask to go to peoples houses now.  Sounds like your daughter is making great gains.  Taurine and tryosine have been really big here with anxiety..

Who am I to complaint???   Also I read that you can do a longer protocol but If I am not mistaking I read 11 days max... (maybe I read it wrong...) Not sure if my child and myself can resist 11 days ... Remember you have to wake up in the middle of the night... 2 or 3 times  Lulubelle: The positives that I am seeing: My son always has be a very mild case of autism. Not tamtrums, not screaming (except when the yeast it\'s out of control), but normally I can go out with him to the mall, to the party and he will be perfectly fine.. I go to disney at least every two month and he loved it.. but he just fall asleep at 8,00 and sometimes has a power nap which never happen when we are at home... I wish... but nope... But he never sit still... Unless he is in the car seat.. or I put him in a high chair.. he stays.. but if not he wakes in the chair, play, eat, and if I let him he will escape, then run, come to me, eat a little more.. so.. that\'s him.... He can watch a 2 hours movie or more with no problems but for instance if I want to read an story to him? not even 20 sec.  With the protocol that behavior CHANGE for a better one. He sit and stays the whole time.. sometimes he tries to wake up in the chair but If I tell him not to do it.. he stops!   After the first round, my husband was out of town and he came back, my other daughter went running to give him a hug and my son did the same. NEVER BEFORE   The eye contact.. it\'s improving.. Sometimes he is so out, in his own world and sometimes he is very very tuned with us...  He is saying a few words.  Like when we say : READY, he says set and go (that\'s new) and every time that he does he smile and look at you in the eye.  Yesterday we went to a store and he wanted a toy, and he gave me the toy and told me O-PEN first time..  So when you hear something like this you think.. wait a minute.. he says that? Or Am I just pretending that he says.. it\'s tricky but I am seeing better socialization with us...  Not to the point that I consider recovered but I think we are on the right track!! And you know what? I was thinking just yesterday in the morning that I didnt want to continue with the ala and dmsa together.. because I see more engagement with the dmsa in the first 3 round.. But when I added the ala, he was more &quot;autistic&quot;  But yesterday was the first 24 hrs off the 5th round and he was SUPER FINE... So that\'s our experience...</div>'

Was it with a one drop dose or did you give a larger dose to start?  Thanks!    I gave Gavin 1 drop to start.  Noticed increase in stimming for a few days but nothing more.  Then increased to 3 drops, twice a day and didn\'t see anything. Then increased to 5 drops, once a day and thought that his desire to converse with his sister increased. (for example: asked his sister \"How\'s it going Lindsey?\" after school.  He always was able to do this, but his desire to was definitely not really there.)  So I gave him a second dose and he came down with the stomach flu.  Not sure if it\'s a detox reaction or really just a coincidence but we are not giving him anything at this point.  He\'s been home from school since Thursday, laying on the couch, puking, being lethargic.  Hasn\'t eaten much (2 small meals) since Wednesday night.

This is the major issue with store bought juices, since everything is pasteurized here in the US.  Tomatoes are the only produce that get healthier when cooked.  But it\'s still better than buying store bought juice.  Is there anyway you can can below 118 degrees? This is when most enzymes are killed, and enzymes imo are the biggest benefit of juicing.</div>  Mimicry, I\'m not sure. From what I read, it seems as if I can do everything without heating until the finally processing stage. It appears that I have to keep the contents boiling for ten minutes.  I agree that it\'s healthier than store bought juice and I\'m looking forward to the summer!</div>  I certainly won\'t discourage you from doing it, I think it\'s wonderful.  It\'s not just healthier physically, but economically and environmentally.  I\'ve only canned green beans and made freezer jam.  So I wasn\'t too familiar with all types of canning.

The conversation basically turned to me and my diet.  I\'m relatively thin, was always active - gymast, dancer and ate a pretty lowfat diet.  I had some gut issues and had trouble digesting eggs, cheese, dairy so I avoided them in my 20\'s.  Through the preganancy I drank soymilk for calcium.  I did not take any CLO or EFA\'s.  I had none of these Essentials to pass along to dd.       My doc seems to feel that these good fats not only aid in growth but also have a protective quality.

' <div class=\"postbody\">My DAN mentioned nicotine patches at our last appointment as an anti-inflammatory as well.  As someone who has struggled my whole adult life with nicotine addiction, I would be very loathe to put any child on the patch, no matter how small the dose.    I\'ve posted some recently about my son\'s great response to Kirkman\'s Gastromune.  My son was struggling with constipation and bloody/mucousy stools and this really got him moving and the blood and mucous stopped.  (Good language &amp; social gains, too).  It contains a few natural anti-inflammatories, including curcumin and cat\'s claw, as well as quercitin (which reduces the IGE allergic response).    It was actually when I described his great response to the Gastromune that the DAN suggested trying the nicotine as an additional anti-inflammatory.      I should note that he reacted really negatively to the Gastromune at first (increased aggression &amp; irritability), so much so that I stopped it in spite of the gains.  A couple of months later, my DH convinced me to try it again, so I did, and we got more gains without the negatives.    I hope this helps.  Renae</div>'

When I talked to the assistant yesterday, she made suggestions for us to take our time calling anyone for psychiatric help or drugs. This is not what the doctor was saying at the meeting. All along I felt that the assistant and the psychologist were on different pages and then the school didn\'t keep us well informed.... I also believe that the assistant knew and understood b more than the psychologist who only saw him for a few seconds compared to the assistant who saw him for 7+ hours spread over a couple days. So I\'m following the assistance advise. Still this is what added to our frustration. One says one thing and the other says another.     Thanks ladies for being there through this!

He also had the \'smears\' in his underwear and huge breakdowns/problems when it was getting bad (and he needed to go).  We never got to the root of what was the problem, but the b-12 shots helped a lot--he got to where he pooped the day after he got his shot.  I don\'t know if it was a sensory issue, or if there was some sort of better understanding or what it was, but it became very obvious that the b12 shots were helping in some way where pooping wasn\'t scary.  He was still pooping in a diaper too, so there was also some shame/embarrassment involved.  We started upping the rewards for pooping, then it became he only got the reward for pooping on the potty, and then one day, it became no big deal.  I don\'t know what clicked, but it did.

Bio-7-dATP can be used to produce biotinylated DNA probes in a variety of labeling reactions, including nick translation, random primed DNA synthesis and 3â€™-end labeling reactions.  The resultant biotin-labeled probes can be used in various hybridization techniques including Southern blots, Northern blots or dot blots. The probes can also be used for in situ hybridization applications. The biotinylated probes have been shown to hybridize to homologous nucleic acid at the same rate and to the same extent as non-biotinylated probes.  The hybridized biotinylated DNA probes can be detected by their interaction with biotin-binding proteins, such as avidin, streptavidin or antibodies coupled to fluorescent dyes or color-producing enzymes.

But other than that, it\'s not that hard. You get into habits and routines, and life just gets better and better after you get the hang of it all. That\'s how I\'d describe it.  But it\'s not for the dull, the ones who\'d rather be shopping at the mall, or at the gym, or whatever, or sitting night after night on the couch watching sitcoms or reading the latest novel.  It\'s hard work - it\'s lots of research and reading, and lots of experimenting and being tuned into your child, looking  at poop, etc.   But so worth it. Today as I was volunteering and in work groups, I watched in delight as my Joey was the FIRST one in the group to get an answer right. Of course, it isn\'t always that way, but to see that possibility - to see it once makes me realize it\'s possible that it will happen more in the future. That is so worth it all!!

' <div class=\"postbody\">This past summer we attempted diflucan. The second day she was slapping herself in the head, was lethargic and all around miserable. We used charcoal, but could never get her to the full three time a day dose. We moved to keto, she could still only do a once a day dose without charcoal, but then started spitting it all out. We kept nystatin in three times a day the whole time. Nystatin seems to reduce her bloating substantially.  Fast forward, got our MOAT back, high 5 out of 8 yeast markers and clostridia. We started flagly. After the second day we started getting die off manifesting as headbanging, hitting and fussiness. About two days later it started getting better and we started Amphotericin B, got more die off, same symptoms. She started pooping three times a day and there was die off evident-some black specks, yellow color, funky texture. We waited about a week for that to stabilize. She finally woke up smiling-rather than headbutting me. We started to add half a dose of diflucan (our doctor put the daily dose in one teaspoon rather than three). Seemed okay, but then she didn\'t poop. Second day we gave 3/4 of the dose. She pooped a very small amount (very odd after the three time a day we saw with the other two meds) About ten hours later she was up for four hours in the middleof the night banging her head, hitting us and looking miserable. She\'s out of it, her eye contact, normally very good, is not good. She\'s not responding to her name like she was. All this started wtih the diflucan. I wondered if it was that she can\'t tolerate the med or if it\'s serious die off. There is an aggressiveness and a misery for her that is at a level we\'ve not seen before...and we aren\'t even at full dose. We are still on flagyl, though we will take a 5 day break after tomorrow\'s morning dose. And we are still on amphotericin.  What should I do? She can\'t seem to function. Should I keep going and see if it gets better? Should I stop because we are on amphotericin anyway and we did get some die off with that? I could add nystatin back in? SHould I lower the dose and see if that helps? I can use AC, which I\'ll give her in a bit, but given all her current meds it\'s super hard to time the charcoal so it doesn\'t absorb something important-and because she is 2.5 she naps so there are limited day hours. This is such a bummer because she was just starting to be her old happy self again.   Help?</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">There are opinions on both sides here.  I DO give Zinc on chelation days to avoid Zinc depletion (and I give extra Zinc on the chelation days).  There may be some wasted Zinc with the DMSA, but I think Cameron has fewer side effects on minerals than off (that\'s based purely on observation, though) when we are chelating.  I did hear some other DAN! practicioners at the last conference say that they advised giving minerals through the chelation as well.  Cameron\'s own DAN! doc advised us to leave off the minerals on chelation days.  I tried that on the first couple of rounds,  but I added them back after doing some research on the issue and found that he tolerated the next round better.    Sorry that there isn\'t a more clear cut answer here.  It\'s probably best to ask your doc what he/she thinks if you are unsure.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">We have been using it for 2 months.  I am one of those mom\'s that are soooo scared to try new things.  Our DAN wanted us to start it and I waited for 2 months doing research prior to starting it and then was still to scared.  I started her out at 1/4 of a 100mg capsule and gave that to her for 2 weeks.  I talked to the DAN again and told him where we were at with it.  He said, &quot;You are slower then molasses!&quot; LOL  I know I am.  He told me to do 1/4 of a capsule for a week and increase 1/4 until we are to the full capsule dose.  We have seen more and more language.  She is using words she has never used before, stricking up conversation, picking up words and using them appropriately.  The other day I picked her up from school and the teacher said she had a pocket full of acorns because all of the kids were picking them up during outside play.  Later in the car she told me she was going to show her dad the acorns and then she said, &quot;Dad is going to freak!&quot;  My 15 yr. old daughter and I looked at each other and cracked up laughing.  She just said it like she talks like that all the time.  Her OT told me she about fell over because she told her, &quot;I like your hair&quot;....&quot;Your flower earrings are pretty&quot;...&quot;Mrs. Elise you are beautiful&quot;.  Mrs. Elise had her hair in braids and it was the first time I remember seeing her hair done like that.  Her OT has said that she is hearing her say more and more typical things and we are also seeing this.  We haven\'t done anything different with any other herbs or supplements except for OSR.  I just wished I wouldn\'t have been as scared and I would of done this sooner.  She also had the opposite of the yeast issues with it.  I know some people say that it stired up yeast in their kids.  She is extremely gut/yeasty kid and it did not kick up any yeast in her.  She is more even killed like she is when she has been on Diflucan and stuff.  We did start doing some homeopathy and Brain Child Intestimend for about 3 weeks prior to starting the OSR and I do know the Brain Child has that molyb stuff in it which people say you should take with it.  I also give it to her at the same time I give her a cod liver pill because they say you should also give it with oils.

There is also a compounding pharmacy in Mulberry, FL who does mb-12 injections.  If you decide to do these, the closer you are the better because all of the compounding pharmacies charge a cold shipment fee because the injections needed to remain cool and be overnighted.  So if you can find one in town, that would be better.    On a side note - Wellness is a good compounding pharmacy.  I know nothing about their glutathione cream.

I have heard of children increasing in negative behaviors as they regain senses that were numbed before; for instance they may start mouthing, licking or biting as they regain feeling around their mouth.  Eventhough that looks bad it\'s a good sign.  Hopefully, Rick or someone will be able to answer.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Daughter 5, atypical autism</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Daughter 5, atypical autism</div>'

He will get OCD if we don\'t have his supps in place to control his histamine reactions.  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">But the antihistamine has bumped him up to having REALLY good days, for almost a week now. It seems to be doing more than just muting his seasonal allergies. </div> Great indicator that you are on the right track!  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">So, I\'m assuming the antihistamine is addressing general inflammation, inflammation that\'s probably been affecting his brain. I know many of you use antihistamines on a regular basis. Is this what your doctors are prescribing them for? I\'ve been anti-medication as much as we can be, but BOY! if we could keep good days like this, I\'d have him on daily antihistamines in a second. </div>  I hear you. When histamine levels are too high or too low they affect the production of neurotransmitters such as seratonin in your brain - these neurotransmitters affect your moods, memory, thought patterns, learning ability, and other functions.    When we keep his histamines under control (methionine, b6, calcium, mag, LL, NDF Plus, vitamin C, inositol, zinc all help)- he does amazing.  When we don\'t we see more mood swings, frustration, irritability, etc.  Things like benadryl (if used too much), claritin, singulair all make him worse so we can\'t use those long term.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Tami</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Tami</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I cannot even begin to say how much I envy those of you who can consider the SCD diet.  My son is GF/CF/SF/low sugar too - and it is getting harder and harder to do this diet as well - because as you mentioned, he is becoming more \"aware\" of the other food choices and is CONSTANTLY going to the pantry and just standing there grabbing for things he is not allowed, and refusing the choices I am giving him.  And he\'s only THREE!!!  The past week or so he\'s been eating a lot more and more frequently.  He is limited to only 2 meat choices and will only eat fruits or veggis on occasion.  I just can\'t get passed that \"hump\" of getting him to eat these healthy things - I just can\'t.  No matter how hard I try, how hard I pray, nothing.  It\'s so discouraging.      Just complaining out loud I suppose and at the same time, letting you know how lucky all of you are that can make that diet work for your child.  It\'s so discouraging.

VSL3 is a pro-biotic known to be effective in degrading oxalates, for which my daughter has tested very high (Great Plains OAT).  Every time I give the VSL3, oxalates would be degraded, releasing yeast, since oxalates bind to yeast. This would explain the stims and yeasty behaviour. So begins a cycle of giving probiotics, releasing yeast, giving anti-fungals, killing yeast, giving probiotics, releasing yeast etc etc.  Maybe another probiotic would not have the same effect on oxalate and thus not stir up yeast?</div>'

Just seems like as it helps the gut heal, you could move to a maintenance dose and eventually phase it out.  I have two children I am giving it to, so it is expensive. I am only doing two droppers twice a day. I\'m not sure if I should up the dose or not, but if I do, boy I will go through a bottle quickly!!  After the first dose, my 2 year old had his first formed poop in forever!  We have been doing it only since Saturday and I got some actual sentences from my pretty non-verbal four year old (I walk with you and I want something to eat!).   I haven\'t had a lot of die off, but still good results. My older son had a small fever, acted flu like and urinated a ton the first day. No die off in the little one.

' <div class=\"postbody\">It has been our experience over the years that yeast and mold die-off looks an awful lot like yeast flare.  When we did a full-boat anti yeast and mold diet for our family (the Feast Without yeast diet) we all STUNK of yeast for about a month.  Our tongues were heavily coated white, out breath was horrible, stools, urine and breath all smelled the same horrible smell--my son smelled so bad overall that I had to make him take a shower before we went anywhere.  It was die-off, and not a flare.  I could weather it because I could see that while I myself smelled, I was also feeling better.  If I were you, I\'d pick a yeast diet and follow it, along with antifungals and probiotics, for a month and try not to second-guess what\'s going on.  If you have taken our all sugar and honey, and most fruit (though I don\'t think all fruit for nutrition reasons) and are eating only well-boiled grains, veggies and some meat, you are not feeding the yeast.  You will have die-off if you have a systemic infection, as we did.  Oh--if you have severe die-off, then the yeast metabolites will be heavy in the stool tests.  I don\'t ever see that talked about.  The stool test doesn\'t differentiate between dying yeast and thriving yeast.  Bacteria is the thing really worth checking for on a test.  and we treat for parasites on a regular basis just because they are so common and we always get a bump from treating for all in our family.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">HI,  Indeed, you are right!  This grain is very healthy.  It has the right, balanced mix of amino acids which means it has the \'complete proteins\' much like meats have.  Of course, like the other poster stated that it can be harder to digest for ASD kids.  It has a rice-like structure, but more chewy, spring-like.  I simply cook it longer.  I use it in risotto like dishes or stir fries with vegetables perhaps, marinating with fresh lime juice/rind at the end.  It also goes great in cold salads with vinaigrette dressing.  It is encouraged to mix with other grains like rice or wild rice to enhance nutrition as well as flavor.  Since it is a seed, perhaps it would be prudent to break up the cooked grains (outer seed membrane) with a stick blender in a course fashion (not fine paste).  This way it still has some texture like rice rather than a soggy puree.  We also give our child a flatbread which is a mix of rice and quinoa flours.  It goes well with spreads like guacamole, meats:  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.glutenfrei-supermarkt.de/Blumenbrot+knusprige+quinoa+schnitten+150g.htm\">http://www.glutenfrei-supermarkt.de/Blu ... n+150g.htm</a><!-- m -->   Although I haven\'t tried it, there might be quinoa flour available on the market so that parents can make a gluten free mix in order to bake bread for their child.    One important thing about quinoa is that this seed is naturally coated in a \'bitter\' substance which is supposed to protect it from being eaten by wild animals.  Although some better brands already rinse the seeds before packing, some brands sell the unrinsed variety.  Therefore, one should give the quinoa seeds 3-5 rinses with cold clean water to make sure similar to the way one would do with rice.  Otherwise, one might be turned off by the bitter aftertaste.  Best Health!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Is it a real tree?  It is very, very common to have big allergies to Christmas trees.  I am one of those people.  For most of my life, I have HATED Christmas--I would love to decorate, but as time wore on, I would fall into a deep depression, hate everything about the final days leading up to Christmas, and couldn\'t wait to get everything down after the holiday.  And then I would feel so great after I got it put away!  A few years ago I read an article about Christmas tree allergy and accompanying mold allergy.  We switched to a fake tree and I am fine.  It is kind of an insidious thing--the allergy will be minor for the first days, and will get worse as time goes by; if you\'re allergic to the tree, the molecules will take time to permeate the environment, and if the mold is the problem, then the spores begin to multiply exponentially after about 1 1/2- 2 weeks.    I would at least consider the possibility that it\'s the tree.  Especially with our kids with such damaged immune systems, that kind of thing can be a huge problem.

My son can\'t even tolerate fruit at all because of the sugar content; when we took it away we saw amazing things!   I\'m a firm believer that diet can help these children tremendously!!  Right now we are battling the tree pollen at the moment and are losing ground.  I haven\'t seen these types of behaviors for a long time!!

He has done wonders on the SCD Diet, but now that the pollen, mold, and airborne allergens are back,  here we go again.  The seizures have started back again!!  I could just cry!!

' <div class=\"postbody\">I\'ve had eczema all my life. For the past few years I have not had any flare ups, I attribute the lack of flare ups to a couple of things. First is using creams instead of lotions. Lotions have a lot of alcohol in them, and if you put lotion on eczema or very dry eczema prone skin it will sting badly. I use Cetaphil cream usually, or the generic cetaphil they sell at WalMart works just as well. Use this cream all the time, even when there aren\'t any flare ups, especially in the winter. I don\'t like petroleum based creams/lotions for the most part, however I will use them on my hands if I am washing my hands a lot since the petroleum has a protective quality. (I don\'t like Aquaphor at all though, usually I use a product by Avon (Intensive Hand Cream) or Neutrogena Norwegian Hands formula.    The other thing that has helped is not using any harsh soaps or detergents. When I use household cleaners of any kind even dishwashing soap, I always use gloves, vinyl gloves not latex. (This is probably not an issue for kids though.) For bathing if I have a flare up I use the Cetaphil wash product, if I don\'t have a flare up I use a mild liquid soap or Dove bar soap.    One other thing, the antibacterial waterless soap, or \"magic soap\" as my son calls it, is extremely irritating. It stings and is very drying, stay away from it as much as possible.    I haven\'t had to use a steroid cream for a couple of years now using these preventive strategies.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I got that with SCdophilus a few weeks ago.  The more I gave her, the crankier she got and it was brutal.  I thought it was die-off so I gave activated charcoal and nothing.  It was so horrible!  It looked like she was experiencing clinic depression.  Maia normally sleeps through the night but she kept waking up and crying like the most sad thing in the world had happened to her and just became all around very unhappy, sad and unusually moody.  I really really looked like depression and not die-off.  I stopped the SCdophilus and later found out that it contains leucine.  My son tends to react to leucine so I wondered if my daughter was reacting to the leucine component or if she had a problem with the acidiophilus.    It took about a week for her to get back to normal after I stopped the SCdophilus.  I had been up to a cap and a half, along with the Kirkmans lactobacillus Duo.  I still have the Kirkmans in place along with the Culturelle and she\'s fine.  I even have her on 2 caps of the Kirkmans.    I seriously wonder what that was -- it\'d be really good to know so I could avoid that.  It was a really horrible reaction and it pained me to see her like that.  The only way to describe what I saw was clinical depression.    I was talking to someone on the BTVC_SCD list whose son experiences a similar reaction to acidophilus.  I might try another brand of acidophilus to see if it\'s acidophilus itself or if she was reacting to the leucine in SCdophilus.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Alberta  Maia, 4 - ASD Ethan, 2.5 - ASD</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Alberta  Maia, 4 - ASD Ethan, 2.5 - ASD</div>'

He has usually had at least 15 words that have always come and gone.  It would be 15 words.  and then a couple months later, he would forget those words and he would have a different set of 15 words.    Definately since treating with prednisolone and keppra, his lang. improved the most.  He can now try and repeat most things we ask him too.  Before Enhansa, chelation, pred. and all the others, we would say say &quot;chair&quot; and it would be a completely off sound.  He is now able to say a lot more.    A veil has lifted with each thing I mentioned.  Enhansa was months of really hard die off.  I increased very slowly, but it was still very tough.  He would have lots of fits, just want to throw rocks in the yard, and became aggressive.  I pushed through because I was seeing more maturity and improvements through the hard time, but it\'s definately something you have to be careful with and pray about.   We had lots of yellow poops for months.  Now we have great BM and are potty trained.  In the long run it was worth it, but looking back it was a very hard time.  No Fenol helped with Enhansa, now we don\'t need it.    Chelation was noticable  improvement almost instantly,  he could finally play with his red barn and animals he had had for 2 years.  I told my sister, &quot;it\'s like his brain finally works&quot;  I hope this helps, it\'s so hard to know when to push through things or not to.

' <div class=\"postbody\">We started DD on Culturelle and it worked really well to help with her acidity issues and bifidus overgrowth. I switched to Custom\'s L. Rhamnosus because I could not find a dairy free and inulin free Culturelle. Anyway, it seems to be great for her but I worry that the main function of this probiotic is not really to colonize but to keep bad guys from growing. Assuming that if you have good guys, they will then be able to grow. But I\'m just not sure if she\'s got good guys in there. DH forgot to give her the probiotic two meals in a row and we\'ve had a big backslide with yeast. I\'m using Candidase for yeast and it works great but we can\'t get off of it. I\'m just wondering how you know your kid can handle more probiotic. Before she had a huge regression, DD was doing well on VSL but can no longer tolerate it. Are there any clues to know when she should be able to handle it, or is it just trail and error? I am so not looking forward to triggering another regression. I guess if she\'s still got big acidity issues, that means her bacteria/yeast/parasite problem is not beat back enough. This road is sooooooo slllloooowwwww.... magic bullet where are you?

However, the interaction of orally ingested probiotics with the intestinal epithelium or other immunologically active intestinal cells has just begun to be rigorously studied. A number of studies with a variety of probiotic strains have been conducted to determine the extent to which probiotics &quot;colonize&quot; or, more correctly, transiently persist in the intestine. The combined results demonstrate conclusively that ingested strains do not become established members of the normal microbiota but persist only during periods of dosing or for relative short periods thereafter (10-14). There is also evidence that common probiotic strains differ in their degree of persistence (10,15). This may reflect in part their capacity to resist the harsh conditions encountered in the upper digestive tract.</div>  Personally we have gotten the wows from the added use of enzymes with the probiotics.

The doctor said that the reason was that if the case is very mild they might not build enough immunity. Last year, both their cases were bad enough that I am sure they are immune now. Maybe the vaccine is like their case and it might be giving some people too mild an immunity.    What I did was to give them anti-virals (like GSE) and keep them pretty covered in Aloe Vera lotion.  They both prefered they Aloe Vera to the calamine.  I did not use the oatmeal baths that the doctor suggested because Nelson is still sensitive to gluten.    I should say Nelson was over his case in record time (about 4 days) while Isabel was sick a good 10 days.  All those vitamins I have him on might have made the difference.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I agree that we have gotten MUCH better results with SCD than GFCF.  My son has made huge progress in the last six weeks of SCD (we were GFCF for 1.5 yrs).    Behaviorally, we are still seeing ups and downs; these last few days, he\'s been acting yeasty again (laughing, stimming, hands in his pants, etc.).  I\'m not sure if we\'re going thru another round of die-off or a yeast flare.  He did start having stools containing yeast w/ roots attached again, so I\'m hoping die-off.    We are actually seeing his apraxia issues disappearing.  He\'s saying 4-5 word sentences, and picking up phrases from just having heard them (drink of water, piece of sausage).  He has also always dropped the last consonant from words, and this is resolving.  He says sleep, help, swing, three (thwee), mountain, fountain, etc.  Before, mountain sounded like meh-meh.  He started saying mommy and daddy (before mama and dada).    His receptive language has taken a nice jump, too.  His teacher says that she can now give him three step commands, and he\'ll follow thru perfectly.  Before, she said she would have to prompt him thru each step.    As far as cognition, last week he counted to 20 without prompting.  This is not something his therapists, teachers, or I have been working on at all.  He just did it out of the blue.  Before, he had only counted to 10.  He\'s started naming alphabet letters, and knows opposites.    I know there\'s a lot that I\'m probably forgetting, but he has improved SO much.    The only downside is that he\'s become really constipated with this diet--this was never an issue before.  He was always on the loose side of the poop spectrum before.    I\'m planning on ordering a yogurt maker soon to start him on the yogurt.    Treating for yeast &amp; bacteria has always given us the biggest gains, so SCD was really a no-brainer for us.  I think the reason why more people don\'t try it is because they think they\'re kids will never accept the food (I know I did).    I love this diet!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello, I am new on this forum, and have found so much usefull information here! My daughter is 2,9 years old and is on spectrum. We started her on MB12 injections 6 weeks ago and we have seen great results. However, for the last 4 injections she regresses a little on the 1 and 2 days after the shot and on the 3rd day she is doing so good. We still do see a progress, even with 2 crampy days, it\'s just bothers me. I wonder why this is happening? If anyone has any experience with this please share! Thank you!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hope  I hope you don\'t mind me being blunt, but if you are not seeing results from diet, supplements, treatment for dysbiosis,  MB12 injections and if your kid does not have heavy metals / does not respond to chelation, I would seriously look at brain inflammation. I think too many of us parents stuff around with this supplement and that and time passes and our kids reach a certain age and they are still not where we want them to be and many times the underlying cause is a more serious problem, namely a brain injury/brain inflammation  and/or problems with immunity. This is what I would look at now. Go to a good DAN who knows about these issues and who has worked with other kids who have these problems. Start doing the necesary tests to see if your kid fits this profile. If a child has not responded by a certain age, I really beleive a chronic inflammatory condition and/or autoimmune problem  is probably at the root and this needs the proper treatment.   kastania</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I really do feel like a ship lost at sea without a competent captain beside myself in the biomedical journey. I have posted a while back that I am thinking to change DAN drs. The reason is that our DAN practioner is a nutritionist and not an MD so I feel she can not give us complete comprehensive care. We see another DAN dr that works with her but just for PK flushes. The other DAN dr has not offered us any other DAN treatment options when we go there for our weekly PK flushes. I am considering another DAN dr that a lot of parents use in our area and actually have done a lot of the paperwork but last night went for the second time to a biomed support group in my area and a lot of the parents who have used the DAN dr I am switching to worked with this DAN dr for several years and switched to the nutrionist I am currently using in conjunction with the DAN dr I am using for the PK flushes. They say they schedule special follow up appointments with the DAN dr who does the PK flushes and state they want to move forward aggressively in biodmed treatment and are now chelating. I want to move forward with chelation with a dr that I feel confident in. One that can offer me comprehensive biomedical treatment that includes nutritional counseling on supplements, what other biomed stuff is appropriate in Caitlin\'s particular situation (since each of our kids is unique) and when it would be appropriate to start chelation. I don\'t want to rush into anything. I want to do everything in it\'s right time. I want a relationship with a DAN practioner that is a team and that I can have a give and take dialogue with and that respects my opinions and choices for my child. I was up late talking with dh about this. I also have heard good things about Dr. Kane and the body bio test. But that would be expensive. Also another dr in upstate in NY I have heard is good but it would be quite expensive as well. All the biomed decisions fall on my shoulders. I told him all of this and I was so wound up and agitated. I am not in denial about Caitlin. She is severly autistic. But I want her to have the best chance to reach her fullest potential and want the right DAN dr to help make this happen. Another issue is that Dh and I make a very nice living but you would never know it. All our money goes for biomed. Dh feels we have to start putting away money for college for Maegan. Dh said if I want an answer from him I should continue with the nutritionist and see her more frequently for follow ups b/c she has helped Caitlin to date. He also feels I should schedule a follow up with the DAN dr who does the PK flushes for us and lay it on the line about what I am looking for in a DAN practioner. I will of course lose the deposit I gave to the new DAN dr I am doing the paperwork on but he thinks that is not a big deal. We hve been GFCf almost 2 yrs. Other parents are advising me SCD. I have researched this diet and I am not trying to be negative but I know I can\'t make that diet work for Caitlin. I discussed it at length with dh and he agrees. All of these things are really tearing me up inside. I feel I am at such a crossroads and really need advisement on what to do. Thanks for listening. It really helped just tying this and getting all my thoughts down. Any thoughts and opinions are appreciated. I just don\'t know which way to turn <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /> I can never get to a level of comfort for too long with this fight against ASD. I thought once Caitlin was in a good school (I love her school and home program run by the school!!!)I could relax on this hyper mode to find the anwers to help Caitlin but of course that has not happened. I feel we need to attack the ASD at all angles while she is young and has the best chance at biomed being effective. Therefore I feel there is this huge clock on the wall and time is running out.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Laura Mom to: Caitlin age 8 ASD Maegan age 11 NT</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Laura Mom to: Caitlin age 8 ASD Maegan age 11 NT</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">This has been my concern with enzymes all along. I don\'t think we know for sure if this is actually more irritating to the digestive tract for some kids. If there is any chance your child has gastric ulcers, rule that out first with h. pylori infection. I honestly think that going with something like ox bile or supplementing hydrochloric acid may be better. Or animal enzymes. The high combination plant enzymes these companies make I don\'t think are studied enough. Some contain molds, but that\'s my opinion. So many have had good success with enzymes but then I see that the effect eventually wears off and you still have autistic behaviors and are still trying to heal the gut.

If you did you would have to give like 20 packs a day to equal one probiotic of another kind. Use it as a yeast aide.     Here is where I purchase mine from.  A little cheaper with like $4. shipping.  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.stopyeast.com/why-buy-threelac.html\">http://www.stopyeast.com/why-buy-threelac.html</a><!-- m -->    I am now giving 2 packs a day and if he seems to have a yeasty diaper I\'ll increase it to 3 packs a day for a couple of days.

He actually hasn\'t been on diflucan for months and months now.    PS: on that link, it says \"membership fee\" but they actually do not charge a membership fee if you call them to order. When the manuf. stopped allowing businesses to sell at wholesale $49.99 they were able to wiggle out of that by charging customers an annual membership fee to sell it at $49.99 instead of $65.00.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi,  1)I guess that an anticholinergic drug can be given.  For now, do some homework and remove foods/supplements that may enhance ACh(choline, Phosphatidylcholine etc...).  It may be challenging to actually check the levels for a patient.  I am not sure, but they told me lumbar puncture and a check on cerebrospinal fluid.  However, I think that this may not give the full picture.  Dr Yasko has discussed this on her forum so you may wish to log in and do some searching on her forum. She suggested boosting the dopamine enhancing foods to favor a better dopamine to ACh ratio.  She also suggests the mild anticholinergic, benadryl.  However, I would work with a doctor on this.  She discusses at length the lack of receptors rather than the level of ACh per se as being the issue in ASD, unlike Alzheimer\'s.  I am not sure whether chelation may directly help with ACh levels.  2)Yes, ACh levels may affect speech.  However, I cannot say exactly.  I noticed firsthand that when I gave choline and/or Seriphos (which may boost ACh), my child became more verbal.  However, I also noticed side effects like foam/salivation and increased rigidity.  By the way, MB12 does this at least in the beginning by boosting ACh.  3) We can endeavor to balance glutamate/GABA in many ways.  You mentioned Namenda.  This is a prescription drug which can have a noticeable effect in many cases by antagonizing glutamate.  However, it can have some side effects.  First, you must remove excitotoxins in meals/supplements that may add to the glutamate level for the child.  Think of it as a cup of coffee that is full to the brim.  If you add just a little more, it will overflow.  That is how it often is with ASD kids.  Here is list of some other things that you can do to help balance glutamate/gaba:  _ Nerve Calm Formula RNA  _ Comfort RNA  _ Gaba/Glutamate Spray (coming)  _ Progesterone cream- Pro-Gest Body Cream  _ GABA (Low Dose in ACAT/BHMT, VDR/FOK, MitoForce and Gaba/Glutamate spray)  _ Pycnogenol (Low dose in UltiFend)  _ Grape Seed Extract (Low dose in ACAT/BHMT, PeptiMycin, and UltiFend)  _ Valerian Root (In Gaba/Glutamate Spray-coming)  _ Jujube (In Gaba/Glutamate Spray-coming)  _ Lithium Orotate based on UEE levels (In Gaba/Glutamate Spray-coming)  _ L-Theanine (In COMT-/VDR+ compound)  _ Taurine (not for CBS + or SUOX Mutation unless suggested on testing)  (source: Yasko forum -  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.ch3nutrigenomics.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=14153\">http://www.ch3nutrigenomics.com/phpBB2/ ... hp?t=14153</a><!-- m --> )  I am starting to phase in the nerve calm RNA because my child was very sensitive to this even at one drop.  Now, she is doing better with this and I see the difference.  She can actually sit down for at least several minutes and watch TV without fidgeting.  Before, just for her to even sit in one place for 3 seconds was unheard of.  The calming effect happens within 10-20 minutes of giving her the drops.  I also give the grapeseed extract 2x/day and L-theanine perhaps 25 mg 2x/day.  She could not tolerate the pycnogenol last year, so I bypassed that one for now.  Don\'t rely on large amounts of just one magic bullet.  Rather I think a more synergistic effect can be enjoyed with small amounts of several key ingredients introduced patiently one at a time.  This is sometimes frustrating business with the \'low and slow,\' but often it is the fastest way without backpedaling constantly and losing more time with the frightful detoxes when too much is given too fast.  If plain GABA is not working for your child, she may have had damage done as a result of tetanus toxoid (DTP vaccine) on synaptobrevin vesicles.  If these cannot fuse with the membranes and release their contents (e.g. GABA), then there may a problem with release, transport and breakdown with neurotransmitters.  Dr Yasko recommends in these cases the use of ashwaganda in conjunction with valerian and GABA to help remedy this situation.  Last but not least, please evaluate calcium to magnesium balance in tandem with glutamate/GABA balance.  Excess glutamate is way more harmful when it has excess, unregulated calcium ions to \'excite\' the neurons.  By watching Calcium levels and keeping them counterbalanced with magnesium, you will help \'unload\' the glutamate pistol of its bullets.  Proper zinc levels (don\'t have to necessarily overdo!) will also help counter excess calcium by closing the ion channel on the neuron.  Yasko says zinc helps control calcium levels much like lithium can help control glutamate levels.  Watch essential elements levels on tests.  The goal is to keep calcium in the lowest \'acceptable\' level, just slightly behind magnesium levels.  4)As mentioned above, Namenda might be worth a try to regulate glutamate.  Dr Yasko speaks about this as some listmates there have posted about this.  You might want to check out the posts there about it.  It can help, however it might have side effects.  5)anticholinergic drugs may be useful, but they can have side effects.  I mentioned Benadryl above, but you must talk this one over with your doctor.  There are many anticholinergics.  In keeping with the original subject of this thread, namely nicotine, if anyone has had any experience with this, please chime in.  I am curious myself and I would like to discuss this with my doctor.  There are some past posts on this board about this as well as on the Yasko forum.  It might be worth a try, although strictly under an experienced doctor\'s supervision.  Kind Wishes!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I don\'t want this to be taken the wrong way, and don\'t usually post, but felt the need to post a response. My 4 year old son is Asperger\'s.  I do agree that given a choice between being severely autistic and Asperger\'s, we are certainly blessed in our diagnosis of Asperger\'s.     But please understand that there are really not as many differences as you might think. We have been through the headbanging, the screaming/irrational meltdowns, eating feces 5-7 times/day for a year, social problems including biting/pinching/hitting other kids to the degree that we had to stop being around other children or going places, problems with schools, embarrassing moments when my \'normal looking\' son does something \'autistic\' in public.  He has severe gastro issues, severe sensory disturbances, metal toxicity, and all the other issues that go hand in hand with ASD.  In addition, many doctors/parents/literature have talked about the fact that ASD is actually harder on the Asperger child because they *know* they are different; the suicide rate is high among Asperger teens.      We are, and have been, doing biomed for several years. We do the whole gamut of interventions - all the various therapies, MB-12, supps, LDN, chelation - to help him just as you do.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I have bought a comprehensive nutritional supplement--I prefer the liquids, but sometimes use pills--and then supplement from there with anything that\'s missing.  Kirkman has good ones.  Your health food store will have good ones.  On a bad day my kids at least get the multi, even if I miss others, which over the years I have found makes a difference.  I also have found, over the years, that there were things in the multi that my kids needed that weren\'t on my radar, and they backslid when I took the multi away.    I feel a good multi can serve as an easy, solid base to build on.  Many in the biomed community, though, do not agree with this, and prefer to go with one individual supplement at a time, and then add them in one at a time.  With the pickiness of our kids, I personally think that a good multi will benefit all of them, and does no harm.  But you will have to find what\'s best for your child.  Be careful of the super-high-dose Bs, though.

This was all years prior to the pregnancy but I am sure it has affected me. I also took xrays for the patients so even though you put the vest on them and run out of the room before pushing the button, I\'m sure you get some exposure.     I had a flu shot in my first trimester (even though I was very wary about it) mostly because I knew people got sick afterward often (didn\'t realize all the dangers)    I had a huge amount of stress because I had a missed miscarriage prior to the pregnancy that was discovered at my 15 week appointment. I didn\'t spot with that pregnancy and lost the baby and had to have 2 D&amp;C\'s before the nightmare was over, then I spotted with DS\'s pregnancy and was scared to death every day that I would lose him.     Lots of Ultrasounds, Pitocin, Epidural, The Hep B of course    He was also born with a soft cleft palate discovered on the day after I had him, it caused feeding issues and they sent me home without acknowledging that he might need a special bottle, so he lost weight and we ended up having to syringe feed him. Despite this slow start, he rolled over for the first at his 1 week check-up, scored 9 &amp; 9 on the apgars, said MaMa at 7 months and <strong>did not </strong>have low muscle tone UNTIL after he was vaccinated over and over again.... he had to have ear tubes at 7 months, cleft surgery and another set of ear tubes at 14 months, several more sets of tubes and another surgery at 2y4m for cleft revision repair, tonsils and adnoids removed.     I think a combination of it all led us to the diagnosis.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Lynn Mom to Dylan (Just turned 5) Somewhere on the spectrum</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Lynn Mom to Dylan (Just turned 5) Somewhere on the spectrum</div>'

The high fats are acting as fuel and converts to a form of glucose that really helps. The simple sugars in SCD could make things up and down a lot, but it\'s a catch 22, complex carbs also make them worse and it doesn\'t solve the diabetes thing which imo is caused by chronic yeast and possibly a low B complex in the system.

' <div class=\"postbody\">GaMaC thanks for the book suggestion. I am going to check that out. Yes I have worked with his SLP on all kinds of exercises to do at home but I guess what I am concerned about is since he does have sensory processing issues regarding his over reaction to sound could this also be hampering his ability to process the words he is hearing. I am currently in a \"struggle\" with school to address his sensory issues and I am looking into AIT.       Alex\'s mom I too have thought that maybe I shouldnt worry too much about the articulation issues since it is very new speech (but hey I am a mom I worry thats my job...lol) I probably wouldnt be as concerned if he didnt have sound sensitivities so bad. His SLP and my husband and I all model the proper way of saying words but he does get frustrated if we keep trying to make him say it over and over and at this point he does not usually get it right even after multiple attempts. I also do not want to discourage him from speaking either by putting too much pressure on him.  His speech really has only started to come in the last 8 weeks but his progressive is so amazing to me it really seems like he had been saving up all these words in his head and one day just started to talk. I know that sounds crazy but he literally had about 5 words in his vocabulary that he used apropriately and now he has more words than I could have imagined and he uses them spontaniously and appropriately.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I don\'t think the MMR and DPT (and most other vaccine remedies) are on abchomepathy because they were not in the original Meteria Medica which is the homeopathy bible.  These remedies are relatively new and are being used with autism more and more.  From what i can remember, MMR is typical for aggressive kids.  Amy Lansky on AutismOne Radio is a wealth of info about this stuff.  She has past shows archived on the site as well.  Her book is terrific and I really suggest reading it.  It explains a lot about her son and how homeopathy came to be.    My son had good success with DPT remedy.  He had a cleansing that night and seemed a bit more focused.   I am interested in trying the hepatitis B remedy because my son had a hard time with this vaccination as well.  I am going to ask homepath at next visit.    Seeing a classical homeopath is a smart move because they use only 1 constitutional remedy, not 1 remedy for each symptom.  Sometimes it\'s hard to get out of that Western medicine mentality of treating all symptoms instead of treating the person as a whole.  It took me awhile to appreciate the cleansing of the body when we are sick and not to keep suppressing the symptoms with medication.   I have incorporated a lot of the Body Ecology Diet principles with my kids with a lot of positives.    Just remember that your remedy is specific to you, so what works for someone else may not be your remedy.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Frivera, Thank you so much for the way you described your kid\'s new visual stims (looking up and air writing). We had the same exact thing started for the first time May 7 and it is still there which is driving me crazy. My kid is 10 years old so it was frustrating to see a new visual stim on top of what he already has.  Around that time May 7 we were adding more of yasko supplements and i thought it is detox because his UTM showed higher excretion rate of cadmium and tungsten.  I will try to add some claritine or zyrtec and see if it helps.  Did you add any new supplement recently?</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Thank you Monica</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Thank you Monica</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I want to add that my family--especially my son--has BIG issues with mold.  I think that\'s what got us into autism in the first place.  Many of the enzymes are derived from molds.  So are the B vitamins.  We have issues with the enzymes and the Bs, and I did not figure out why for several years.  The molds can cause CRAZY behaviors--read \"Breaking the Vicious Cycle\" to learn how the mycotoxins created by mold and yeast colonization can wreak havoc with brain activity.  Many mental illnesses are tied into the molds, as is hallucinogenic behavior.    I\'m with Kenny V on introducing things every three days.  And I am speaking from si years of experience with this--YOU WILL HAVE A HARD TIME IF YOU DON\'T KNOW WHAT IS CAUSING YOUR ISSUES.  It makes me sick to think of the time it took to go back, pull EVERYTHING out and start again.  With some of the things, like the Bs, he was so messed up that I couldn\'t tell if ANYTHING was working.    If you see a huge reaction, BACK OFF.  Cut the dose.  If your child is that wild, there is something wrong.    I want to say this carefully....if your doctor\'s been on Oprah, etc (and I know who you\'re talking about) then they are FLOODED with patients.  And I suspect they\'re resorting to a \"one size fits all\" approach with the kids they\'re seeing in order to fit everyone in.  And autism is definitely NOT a one size fits all kind of disorder.      I am seeing this a LOT recently.  Doctors who send these moms and dads home with an arsenal of interventions, and tell them to shoot this all at the child at the same time.  This HAS to turn the kid\'s body chemistry upside down!!  These kids are BROKEN, and it takes TIME to right the chemistry--and if it isn\'t done in a moderate manner, it\'s a mess.    I would not question your doctor\'s expertise, but if you have a bunch of veterans who raise their eyebrows at something your doctors are suggesting, I\'d take another look.  In the end, it will be YOU who recovers your child, and not your doctors.  YOU are living in the laboratory with your son, and you will need to guide your doctors with your son\'s treatment.  It\'s true.      If you are very new, get some books and start reading!!!  Those books are the best thing that ever happened to autism.  You have to become an informed patient, especially in a busy office.  The doctors will listen much better also if you are well-read and informed about the interventions.    This is hard--especially getting started.  Go with your gut!!  And, remember, YOU HAVE TIME.  You really do.  My son didn\'t ask his first meaningful question until he was 8 1/2.  Today, at 10 1/2, he has NT friends, watches ball games with my husband, went to a car show and picked out the car he wants one day, and is planning to marry and be a scientist when he grows up.  He is, finally, fully conversational.  We did not start diet until he was five, and biomed two years after that.      You are blessed to start with such good doctors from the beginning.  We were not so lucky.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">The only way you will know is if you try.  The whole diet thing sucks because you have to take stuff with you pretty much everywhere (if you are, like us, also pretty much organic or at least natural with no preservatives, artificial colors, etc.)    I don\'t know if I\'m the best one to evaluate whether or not it\'s worth it because I still have a child with autism.  However, anything I can do to make him feel a little better is worth it to me.  If he doesn\'t get to eat junk but can have a normal bowel movement, it\'s worth it.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">HI,  Valine, Isoleucine and leucine are the branched chain amino acids and phenylalanine is an essential amino acid which must be derived from what we eat.  Phenylalanine is the starting point for a very important neurotransmitter called dopamine which we need to learn and have attention etc.  Based on her limited diet, she probably is not getting enough protein.  Hence, the low aminos on the panel.  However, her condition could also be worsened by her gut problems, since you mentioned that her belly is irritated.    What did doctor Usman say about her gut;was a stool test done?   Is she digesting proteins, carbohydrates and fats okay?   Was a digestive enzyme given?  Is she on probiotics?  The High Taurine and Glutamic acid are worrisome.  Glutamic acid (glutamate) can be potentially excitotoxic when it is too high.  This points to the need to protect her brain from excessive excitotoxicity;stims, inability to focus, constipation.  The high Taurine might be that she has a cystathione beta synthase upregulation (CBS+).  This enzyme is causing the methyl cycle intermediates to prematurely flowdown the transsulfuration pathway forming too much cysteine.  If cysteine is high, the production of taurine will be favored at the expense of glutathione.  Conversely, if cysteine is low, the production of glutathione will be favored over taurine by default.  She is wasting taurine (which is needed for calmness and bile production) which is also wasting magnesium (also necessary for calmness and over 300 enzymatic reactions).  Again, I emphasize the following page which talks about many aspects of autism.  Please click on the \'Glutamate-GABA imbalance\' to read about the dangers of excitotoxicity.  Also, please click on the link \'CBS: Cystathione Beta Syntase\' which may apply to your child.  You can ask Dr Usman to test her for this polymorphism.  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.heartfixer.com/AMRI-Outcomes-Non-CV-Autism-Methyl%20Cycle.htm\">http://www.heartfixer.com/AMRI-Outcomes ... 0Cycle.htm</a><!-- m -->  And more generalized info: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystathionine_beta_synthase\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystathion ... a_synthase</a><!-- m -->  On the autismweb, you can read more about excitotoxicity in a current discussion in which I participated: <!-- l --><a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://www.autismweb.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=23727\">viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=23727</a><!-- l -->   How were her levels of ammonia? What about alpha ketoglutaric acid?  The processed meats like hotdogs and sausages usually have MSG(monosodium glutamate) or other hidden forms of excitotoxin like hydrolized protein, yeast extract.  Unfortunately, some foods naturally contain glutamate: tomatoes, parmesan, mushrooms, milk, wheat.  You should remove these from the diet if you can; they are overloading her neurons.  It is like a narcotic along with the casomorphins from milk products and gluteomorphins from wheat product( think mac n\' cheese).  These kids crave all the stuff which is not good for them.  Just like adults who crave things like cigarettes, alcohol.</div>'

I have actually just had what seems like a cold that is just lingering on.. maybe its swine flu, who knows...   onerock, I dont think youre being paranoid, esp since your son gets sick so easily... I dont even want to take my daughter in for a well baby checkup right now bc I dont want her to get sick.. I dont even think she needs to go but my mom wants me to take her...   Anyway, its very scary that people are dying from flu vaccines.  Just wondering, does anyone know when reactions to flu vaccines usually happen, within days, weeks, etc?  I am just curious. My SIL just took her 2 little girls (22 months and 3 years) to get flu shots.. She posted it on facebook saying she was taking them to get flu shots and she wondered what they would think about it. I guess she hadnt gotten them flu shots before.. Anyway, her kids seem to be ok today. I think they may have gotten the shots yesterday or today... I posted a message for her but it was probably too late.. I dont think she read it yet... I swear, she really must not read ANY of the articles I post on my FB page or she probly wouldnt get her kids a flu shot! Then again none of my husbands side of the family thinks vaccines are bad and my FIL as well as my mom and grandmother get their flu shot every year!.  Anyway I still dont know if it was a regular shot or the H1N1 shot that her kids got.  I am hoping for their sakes that its not the H1N1 shot...    Speaking of which, Obama has declared an &quot;emergency&quot; now so does this mean they are definitely going to give the shots with squalene? Its scary, my husband is suppose to get one with being in the military.. I know it wont be good for him!  And I hope mandatory vaccinations and quarantines arent coming soon!  Anyway, I cant wait until this whole mess blows over.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Interesting info I came across reading about lead. So, after one of my posts about lead and it\'s storage in bone I read up on it. First off I think mold and the metals/lead and mercury that can be stored in the bones have a correlation and work together to cause problems. one symptom of mold exposure is easy bleeding. my son had a bad nose bleed yesterday and my daughter has had this during seasonal changes too. Mold depletes vitamin K causing the hemorraging phenomenon and easy bruising. Not only that, lead causes calcium go loose and get into the cells, too much of it. This is the mold/oxalate link. During rapid development stages bone releases a lot of lead that is tightly bound. If you are low in vitamin K, you will not be able to control the release on a more ongoing basis. This is also why I think recovered without chelation ASD kids can regress in puberty stages because of the rapid bone growth releasing metals, destroying DNA and cells. Old people have this same problem. Lead can be stored for up to 30 years in bone. During pregnancy, women will also release stored lead with the bone adjustments for pregnancy. Now the interesting thing about lead and it\'s inteference with enzymes it will strongly affect the enzyme that guess what? uses vitamin D for the body. This is how the large skull happens with kids exposed to lead and immune system problems they have, they can\'t use vitamin D.   being exposed to mold during the seasons or in your home is going to cause regression with the release of metals. Growth spurts are going to cause regressions from released metals. Metals intefere with minerals. important ones.   This is great info on lead, read up all!  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Lead has no known physiologically relevant role in the body,[26][59] and its harmful effects are myriad. Lead and other heavy metals create reactive radicals which damage cell structures including DNA and cell membranes.[60] Lead also interferes with DNA transcription, enzymes that help in the synthesis of vitamin D, and enzymes that maintain the integrity of the cell membrane.[13] Anemia may result when the cell membranes of red blood cells become more fragile as the result of damage to their membranes.[61] Lead interferes with metabolism of bones and teeth[62] and alters the permeability of blood vessels and collagen synthesis.[19] Lead may also be harmful to the developing immune system, causing production of excessive inflammatory proteins; this mechanism may mean that lead exposure is a risk factor for asthma in children.[62] Lead exposure has also been associated with a decrease in activity of immune cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes.[62] Lead also interferes with the normal metabolism of calcium in cells and causes it to build up within them.[35]</div>  Enzymes The primary cause of lead\'s toxicity is its interference with a variety of enzymes because it binds to sulfhydryl groups found on many enzymes.[3] Part of lead\'s toxicity results from its ability to mimic other metals that take part in biological processes, which act as cofactors in many enzymatic reactions, displacing them at the enzymes on which they act.[13] Lead is able to bind to and interact with many of the same enzymes as these metals but, due to its differing chemistry, does not properly function as a cofactor, thus interfering with the enzyme\'s ability to catalyze its normal reaction or reactions. Among the essential metals with which lead interacts are calcium, iron, and zinc.[58]  One of the main causes for the pathology of lead is that it interferes with the activity of an essential enzyme called delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, or ALAD, which is important in the biosynthesis of heme, the cofactor found in hemoglobin.[18] Lead also inhibits the enzyme ferrochelatase, another enzyme involved in the formation of heme.[6][18][63] Ferrochelatase catalyzes the joining of protoporphyrin and Fe2+ to form heme.[6][13][18] Lead\'s interference with heme synthesis results in production of zinc protoporphyrin and the development of anemia.[64] Another effect of lead\'s interference with heme synthesis is the buildup of heme precursors, such as aminolevulinic acid, which may be directly or indirectly harmful to neurons.[65]  [edit] Neurons   Lead exposure damages cells in the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in memory. Hippocampi of lead-exposed rats (bottom) show structural damage such as irregular nuclei (IN) and denaturation of myelin (DNS) compared to controls (top).[66]Lead interferes with the release of neurotransmitters, chemicals used by neurons to send signals to other cells.[13][19] It interferes with the release of glutamate, a neurotransmitter important in many functions including learning, by blocking NMDA receptors. The targeting of NMDA receptors is thought to be one of the main causes for lead\'s toxicity to neurons.[66] A Johns Hopkins report found that in addition to inhibiting the NMDA receptor, lead exposure decreased the amount of the gene for the receptor in part of the brain.[67] In addition, lead has been found in animal studies to cause programmed cell death in brain cells.[19]  [edit] Complications Lead affects every one of the body\'s organ systems, especially the nervous system, but also the bones and teeth, the kidneys, and the cardiovascular, immune, and reproductive systems.[59] Hearing loss and tooth decay have been linked to lead exposure,[68] as have cataracts.[69] Intrauterine and neonatal lead exposure promote tooth decay.[70][71][72][73][74][75][76] Aside from the developmental effects unique to young children, the health effects experienced by adults are similar to those in children, although the thresholds are generally higher.[77]  [edit] Renal system Kidney damage occurs with exposure to high levels of lead, and evidence suggests that lower levels can damage kidneys as well.[78] The toxic effect of lead causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome, in which the proximal tubular function of the kidney is impaired.[79] Long-term exposure at levels lower than those that cause lead nephropathy have also been reported as nephrotoxic in patients from developed countries that had chronic kidney disease or were at risk because of hypertension or diabetes mellitus.[80] Lead poisoning inhibits excretion of the waste product urate and causes a predisposition for gout, in which urate builds up.[81][82][83] This condition is known as saturnine gout.  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning</a><!-- m --></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Jen (mom of 3)  <strong><span style=\"color: #00BF00\">iherb referral code: HOF516</span></strong> <em>save $5 on first purchase</em></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Jen (mom of 3)  iherb referral code: HOF516</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Audrey,    My kids had positive results going from GFCF to SCD.  We did SCD faithfully for almost 6 mos (minus dairy) and now have added back in potato (rotating, of course) and are about to trial quinoa, soaked first for 24 hours.      Red flag foods for my kids are:  apples, bananas, brown rice (but not rice flour, just the rice itself, they can\'t digest it), corn, soy, table sugar and high phenols/salicylates.  I\'m finding enzymes to be some help but not with corn, apples or bananas.   If you see it in their poop or they are addicted, they probably shouldn\'t eat it.    It\'s very important to rotate.  This is something I didn\'t do when I started GFCF and I\'ve lived to regret it the past 2 years.  I think early on it\'s best to make as many things from scratch and organic as possible.  That way you control the ingredients, no preservatives, dangerous chemicals, etc.  This is just my opinion based on our experience and the opinion of 3 DANs I\'ve spoken to over the years.    Also, check to make sure your child is getting enough healthy fats.  Every organ in your body including your brain needs enough carbs, fat and protein to function.  There are some things you just can\'t get from supplements.  If one of these is lacking, it can impair cognitive functioning.  Fitday.com has a program that you can plug in what your child is eating, amounts, etc and will tell you if for their height, weight, etc if they are getting what they need.    Hope this helps.  I know this diet stuff is a lot of work but we\'ve found it to be worth it.  I hope you do too.    Dana R.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">we did have some wetting only at night that subsided around 3 months but have recently had a few again and we are at 1.2 years on mb12. so i started to track it, getting up every hour to see when it occured not fun when you need sleep too but i thought it was needed to find out why and when.     he was doing it early in the morning not wanting to get out of bed to go as still tired so we make sure he goes potty a lottttttt before bed and that helps but i tracked it again and found on the weekend when he goes to bed later and wakes later when the room is light he had no problems getting up and going even though there is a night light in the room. after an episode of coming home late one night from grandpa\'s house he wouldnt go down the hall while it was dark to get to the potty and another time the same thing happenned he made me go turn on the lights first i finally put it all together that he was afraid of the dark!!!! when he wakes in the morning and it is dark he wouldnt get out of bed, wouldnt call for me and couldnt hold it so just wet the bed.     my speculation is that if the mb12 is fixing or bypassing the pathway to better understanding and cognition there may be many behavioral reason to wetting. some that would seem more to a toddler or a first timer on the potty in regards to fears and such but very likely to be happeninng in our kids as they may be learning things that were missed at certain milestones like scared of the dark or the noise the flush makes or a number of things.     my other thought is that the urine is a path of detox and at times the mb12 would be getting the glutathione pathway working a bit therefore detox would come where it hadnt before and the ability to hold would not be there as the toxins needing to be removed would be creating a different blatter sensation perhaps stronger more intense etc. and that may explain daytime wettings.     last thought would be during a detox cycle the body needs more fluid and you may not realize how much more your child is drinking b/c the body needs the fluids to get the kidneys to urinate more frequently and therefore clear the toxins effectively. if they are holing it somewhat at school b/c of inability to ask or not enough breaks to accomodate etc. increasing amount at home would make sense and once our kids are home from a hard day of aba and or school they need that time for themselves to do their own thing unwind and paly etc. kids especially boys tend to get absorbed and forget to go so to speak so it may be a bit of that too.     encourage many opportunities to go and even if you dont think they need to or they say no try anyway i find my guy sometimes goes a bit and then quickly wants to get back to his stuff so it is not fully being drained. good luck hang in there!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Lisalynn  keeping hope and faith through it all.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Lisalynn  keeping hope and faith through it all.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I would stop the Trienza for now. You can add it back in later if you want. Right now he needs the LOD--low-oxalate diet. If he eats any of these foods, take them out:  spinach  tea  peanut butter and other nuts or butter made from them  chocolate or cocoa  soy  most flours--white rice flour is somewhat low but only use a bit of carbs made from it every day. (like one slice of bread, one bowl of cereal,etc)  all berries  yellow squash  tomoto sauce or things made with it (baked beans, etc)  -----------  The hardest things to avoid are soy and flours.  Once you take away these foods he will have worse behavior before he blossoms. It will last about 3 weeks. he will have tummy pain, and pain on urinating because the oxalates are leaving the tissues. This is called \'dumping\' oxalates. Hang in there for the three weeks--we saw the best behavior ever after that dumping stage.   Now, my girl does still dump but only about once per week.

On a bad day he could be scripting non-stop about books he read, shows he watched, totally not present not related to where he is or what he is doing.  It is very hard to teach him anything when he is distracted.   We have been doing biomed for over 2 years now, but I did anything specific to help him with his distraction issue. Any suggestions? or anyone has good experience with any supplements that help attention ?  Thanks a lot, -Ade</div>'

It was impressive.  But, you know the internet...I\'d like to assume they were real numbers.  Tami, do you know of any concrete research like this on liver life?  I can\'t find the site again--it was some kind of liver doctor that supposedly uses the liver life in his practice.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Kristie,  I had my son on MB12 shots for 5 or 6 months through Pfeiffer Treatment Center.  Although his dose was Dr Neubrander\'s, we were giving him TMG with the MB12 shots.  Rick posted that TMG could stop the MB12 from working as well.  I was doubtful, to be honest. Gavin had been on TMG for about a year, even before starting MB12 so I was nervous to take it away.  But after he explained why, I decided to try it.     By using DR N\'s protocol Gavin\'s hearing sensitivities went away, delayed (back then I didn\'t notice he even had one until taking TMG away) response to questions disappeared, better use of pronouns, longer conversations, understanding more at school. THat was just from taking the TMG away.      When we just increased the dose to every other day, he has had an amazing increase in his desire to be with us interacting all day long.  He interacted okay before, but now he would rather be with us than play his playstation.  Right now he is playing police cars with his 3 year old sister.  He is 7.  He is telling her what to do and making the stern voice of the police officer getting the \"criminal\" out of his car.  But he\'s not getting upset if she does it her own way.  His little sister can\'t get enough.   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /> They have always played together but this is a new level he seems to be reaching.

' <div class=\"postbody\">1000 mg of Taurine 3 times a day is a very high dose, the maximum.  Are you using it to curb hyper behavior?  500 mg of taurine is a typical dose, higher if being used for behavior.  My son currently takes 500 mg daily, and when he is hyper I increase it 500 mg at a time, ramping it up slowly to, at the most, 2000 mg.  As I follow his behaviors, I decrease the dose, so it really varies weekly for my son.   I definately agree with your instinct to cut it back, and I bet as you ramp up the dose of NDF Plus you will be able to cut it back even more <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />     His morning urine being 6.0 is very good, that was urine right?  Has it remained around 6?   One thing I noticed with Liver Life is that once my son started to drain acids his behavior improved and he seemed happier and more compliant, I will be curious to hear what others see!!    My son gets a tummy of gas now and then, but it was at it\'s worst when we first started the prescription chelator.  His only relief came from Iberogast from Enzymatic Therapy.  You can find this at the hfs, it works within seconds, really wonderful stuff and it is hmeopathic, so he can take it any time with anything.  My sons gas was so bad he would lay on the floor crying and tuck pillows and stuffed animals under his belly for pressure.  Honestly, the Iberogast is truely wonderful and I highly recommend it.  Aloe Juice will help with digestion and helps to move the bowels, if your son is not going daily, a few ounces of Aloe Life aloe juice may help him out, and it will also help with the gas too.    You said your son cannot tolerate folic, tmg, dmg....my son too, he has high histamines and these make him fussy and hyper beyond belief.   I have also found that my son has difficulty with zinc, and can only tolerate a whole food source of zinc, the brand is actually called Whole Foods.  Otherwise he pukes up any other brand.  Do you suspect the zinc source may be causing an upset tummy at night?  GABA is another tricky one, this is great for the majority, but in my family of high histamine folks, not one of us can tolerate GABA.  It makes me feel angry, grumpy and tired (yet unable to settle down) all at once......just thought I would mention that, just in case.    NDF Plus - any way he takes it is great!  If it is easier with the water stick with it.   I do think the increase in stimming and trouble sleeping is due to the metals coming out.  My son went through this his first week on NDF Plus, it was really severe though and he bacame soooo sick.  I started him on one drop daily and he ended up unable to sleep, lathargic and was in severe pain.  When those pathways finally open up and pull out toxins the body seems to go into an overload.   I would put one drop in 8 ounces of water, and just give 2 tbs. of that water as the morning dose.  You can keep the remaining water in the fridge.  Then ramp it up to twice daily in a few days, then double the dose a few days after that.....I know this sounds slow, but it is important to go slow so that the body can tolerate the detox, otherwise he will have a healing crisis and that is so scary and so very painful.      I know I have thrown a lot at you, sorry about that....I think you are doing so much for your son, it really is so wonderful that you know so much.  My son was 7 when I started biomed., I just didn\'t know and really wish I had known sooner.....be proud, take it slow, and keep us posted <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />     I hope something here helps,    Blessings,</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Dana</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Dana</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">well, i believe that therapies and biomed are equally important, especially for more impacted children.  our son has been in therapy (in varying degrees) since he was 2.5 years.  we haven\'t seen much from them until recently (he will be 4 this weekend) and it directly correlates to improvement in health.  BUT - he does have a good memory and we do see him do things that his therapists from a year ago were trying to get him to do, so even when he couldn\'t produce what they wanted, he was still absorbing it.  our son is pretty delayed and i just don\'t believe there is any way he could make good progress in any amount of reasonable time without intensive therapy - he doesn\'t have all the tools he needs and that\'s what he is now learning.  he currently goes to two separate schools - one public, one private and between the two receives about between 15-20 hours of therapy weekly.  the private school will also be setting us up a home plan within the next month, and he will be receiving even more therapy (from us) at that point.  i just think the two (therapy and biomed) work very synergistically together.</div>'

Notforsaken......I hear you completely about the nutritionist, believe me I tried for 1 1/2 years on my own, we\'ve done the gfcf diet since dx in Nov 2005, and before that we had no milk and almost sugar for 2 years before that.... I also have always limited sugar to the extent that Luke\'s teeth are amazing according to the dentist, it is certainly not from good oral hygiene because Luke hates brushing his teeth.  Every time I tried supplementation Luke\'s ultra sensitive stomach would have a really bad reaction, I needed help in finding the right schedule, quantitiy, which ones would go wtih what, when to give them, etc, and the nutritionist specialises in Autism and ADHD, so although it is yet another expense, she can do alot of the stuff that a DAN does and she is much cheaper than a DAN...until a month ago there wasn\'t a DAN in BC, now there is and I am actually really pleased that we were able to do alot of urine tests and supplements/enzymes through the nutritionist so that by the time we got to the DAN dr she only needs to do an OAT and IgG test on him and only recommended 4 additional supplements....I don\'t begrudge any professional working with my son the fees needed, I just begrudge it coming out of my pocket all the time....My job is insurance, between govt and insurance most of this stuff should be covered, but it isn\'t, DH and I each get $500 a year for a naturopath, it doesn\'t go very far at all.   If it helps Luke then it will be an investment and I am sure that the Hbot can be resold in years to come, I just feel sick when I look at the bills.    Notforsaken....The DAN conference my DH just went to last month was all about the order of things, they were stressing that the mHbot should precede chelation (removing metals), we had done one round of chelation already and have now switched focus to hbot, after that we will consider iv glutathione, they were saying that the glutathione levels need to be working well otherwise the chelation will not work as well....so we are tackling ways to increase glutathione first and we will do chelation last of all now.

He understands what we are saying, he understands his teachers, he is happier and we are getting him to be healthier.  Luke was tested for yeast, but he did not have any, what he did have was 3 nasty bacteria \" gamma strep, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staph aureus\" he also did not have enough good bacteria \"lactobacillus\" so now he has a probiotic.  What makes me mad is that these bacteria cause inflamation of the gut, diahrea, constipation, stomach infections, etc.  And all it took to find it was collecting abit of poop, and sending it to a lab and then giving him one little probiotic pill each day.  My kid has had this stuff in his little tummy for goodness knows how long and no doctor that he has ever visited from the local GP, PED, hospital, etc has ever bothered to collect abit of poop and test it to see why he has constipation and an array of other discomforting gut symptoms.  I\'m mad with myself that I did not do more, I\'m mad with the medical profession for being the supposed \"experts\" and not doing this, and I am relieved and thankful to my naturopathic DAN doctor who continues to test my kid and provide me with answers, one at a time.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Lily,  From what you wrote, it almost sounds like, if your child is doing LDN and getting sick a lot, that you should back down on the dose.  My son has been on LDN for about 2 months now.  We have seen great gains in cognition, but he has gone from sickness to sickness over the last month.  I had thought from some other J McCandless posts on the LDN board that we should stay at our dose (3 mg) and just push through, but I am wondering if we should decrease our dosage and stabilize.  Does that sound right to you?    Where did you get the info you posted above?  I would love to read more--I am having trouble understanding just how to use the LDN.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I was looking for any info I could find on being pregnant in a moldy home, but there isn\'t anything specific.  But the crux of it is that you are considered to be immune compromised as a pregnant woman, and so is a newborn.  So I think you need to do some homework.  But, the beginning things are....    *  Any air filter that uses a HEPA filter, and preferably a UV light filter as well.  Do not get an Ionizer-type filter.    *  Clean your home.  Mold spores replicate, and you need to stay after them so they are not around to multiply.      *  Get a good vacuum cleaner.  IT MUST USE A BAG.  BAGLESS ARE WORTHLESS AND ONLY SPREAD THE MOLD AROUND.    *  Wash your bedding at least once a week--with bleach and rinse twice--and change your pillow case every two nights.  Use a hypoallergenic cover for pillows and mattress.    *  Get rid of stuff.  This might be our biggest problem from what I read--we have an incredible amount of stuff that\'s collecting mold and dust.  Especially keep that bedroom clean.    *  Look at the mold diets.  That\'s the second line of attack after environment.    *  Keep the humidity down in your home, especially if you live in the south :(.  Like me.  It\'s a catch 22--you have to close your house up to keep it low-humidity, but that traps toxins.  But \"keep it clean and dry\" is the anti-mold motto, and dry means air-conditioned.    *  Get outside in the sun!!!  Sunlight is mold\'s public enemy #1.  A couple hours of sunlight can do really great things to rid your system of the mold.  And take a vitamin D supplement.      That\'s my two cents.  But you will have to get on Google and read, read, read!!!!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Apparently the ones to avoid are oxide, hydroxide and carbonate because they don\'t absorb as well.  The best absorbed forms are citrate, malate, glycinate, asparate and amino acid chelate.  Dr McCandless recommends the glycinate form in her book, and I understand it is not supposed to cause the problems with loose stools that citrate and some of the other forms can.      Personally, we needed the citrate because of constipation, so I don\'t have any personal experience with the other forms, although I know other parents that have used the glycinate with good results.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Anyway, i have a question. Cole is 85 pounds and I started him on only 8.3mg which is obviously very low for him - less than 1/8mg per pound. So, I know we will go up quite a bit eventually. He had no noticeable effects (good or bad), so can I go ahead and increase next weekend? Or should I wait a while longer? I was thinking of increasing to 12.5mg which is 1/2 of the 25mg caps we have.  WDYT? Thanks! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />[/quote]  *****Normally its recommended to do 5 rounds before increasing. The reason is you can\'t tell much by one round and the rounds are accumulative. This keeps you from getting in trouble with yeast or adrenals.  Some kids can take a lot of chelators, others are more sensitive.  And I like your topic line, made me smile.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">You know, we have been doing this for five years, and have done Valtrex ( in the past) for longer than a year. No change.

I would instead get her on a good multi (Klaires is one example) a good Cod Liver Oil (we have used Nordic Naturals in the past and lately are using Garden of Life CLO), and begin to look into chelation, low-dose Andrew Cutler style. Do the GFCF diet and take out all colors, sugar, preservatives, etc.  And I would have been a bit open-mouthed about his comment. Yes, there are children who are \'fixed\' by biomedical but it is a long, hard road. It isn\'t done in 6 months with a snap of the fingers.

My son\'s stools are chronically light, but this was VERY light--but it seems that they are, as of yesterday, back to their usual somewhat darker color.  We used the Hulda Clark zapper on him for the first time in several weeks, as I had stopped nystatin for many days and he was having a yeast flare again (very coated tongue.)    I also have begun a comprehensive supplement with him which may actually be feeding yeast, though we are seeing very impressive gains with expressive language.  I will add some taurine in and see, but I\'m wondering if it may be low iron, as I am reading around; as I cook all that we eat, we don\'t have the benefit of the &quot;fortified&quot; foods that have so much iron in them these days.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi,   If you are an overmethylator (depending upon the definition...COMT+ and/or low whole blood histamine ), you will have a certain tolerance threshold for methyl donors.  Although all of us regardless of our status need methyl groups to carry out bodily processes, overmethylators will do better to limit methyl donors.  If this is the case, you will probably do better with hydroxycobalamin, adenosylcobalamin(dibencozide), cyanocobalamin.  The body may transform the b12 into the methyl form.  You mentioned the methylfolate.  If you don\'t have an MTHFr single nucleotide polymorphism, then I don\'t think that you will have too much of an issue just supplementing either plain folate of follinic acid (5 formyl tetrahydrofolate; like you said the one in between).  With the plain folate, your body may be able to produce the various forms of folates that you need.  However, if you do have the MTHFr problem(s), then your body may have a problem utilizing the plain folate and thus, transform it into the methylfolate form.  In such a case, you might be able to tolerate a small dosage of the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate providing that you limit other methyl donors e.g., TMG, DMG, MB12, Curcumin, Theanine, CoQ10, Idebenone, Carnitine, DMAE, choline.  Remember, we all need methyl groups; it is simply a matter of being careful with how many if one is an overmethylator.  If you wish to lend support to the Betaine Homocysteine Methyltransferase pathway, you can use phosphatidylserine (either as a complex along with phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine or seriphos) instead of the methyl donor, TMG.  Good Luck.</div>'

They are very low oxalate, and the popovers are great for snacking on later in the day, or freezing to have on hand at short notice.  While the oxalate content of potato starch is still unknown, it probably has very little, if any, oxalate content because of the way potato starch is extracted from the potato slurry.

And they are sugar-free, and very low oxalate.     1 cup water  Â½ cup butter, margarine or shortening  1/3 cup potato starch flour  2/3 cup rice flour  Â½ tsp salt  4 eggs    Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Grease 15 muffin cups.    Combine water and butter in a large saucepan.  Bring to a rapid boil.  Remove from stove.  Add flour mixture all at once.  Stir with a wooden spoon until mixture forms a ball.  Cool 5 minutes. Add unbeaten eggs one at a time, beating well with an electric mixer after adding each egg.    Drop by large tablespoons into muffin cups.  Bake 20 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 and continue baking 20 minutes more.         [b]German Pancake[/b]    Kind of a cross between an omelet and a pancake, this is a good legal breakfast when served with sugar-free syrup.  Very low oxalate if made with coconut milk or real milk.    Â¼ cup butter or margarine  3 eggs  Â½ cup coconut milk or rice milk (or real milk)  Â¼ cup gluten-free flour mix (I use Bette Hagmanâ€™s mix of 2 c. rice flour,         2/3 c potato starch and 1/3 c tapioca starch)    Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Melt the butter in a glass pie pan in the oven.  Meanwhile, mix the eggs and milk in a blender.  Add flour and blend again.  Pour into pie pan.  Bake 18-20 minutes.  Serve with syrup, jam or fruit.  Makes 4 servings.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span>      <span class=\"gensmall\">Last edited by <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3475&amp;sid=65d8ade30aafa882717d807d99259f7f\">amanda NC</a> on Sat Feb 16, 2008 2:00 pm, edited 1 time in total.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Right, I think baby teeth can also be tested for mercury.  However: a) has your kid lost any of his baby teeth yet, and do you have them?? b) that\'s not as common of a test, so what\'s the cost/benefit ratio.    The hair (and teeth) tests will show past exposure.  The porphyrin(sp?) will show issues, but may not be fully consistent.  Since mercury, arsenic, etc can be so deeply held in tissues, only a challenge test (using a chelator) will show if you have any toxic metals in you.  The chelator challenge tests are also flawed since neither DMSA nor DPMS cross the blood-brain barrier and hence can\'t measure any metals in the brain, and don\'t go into some tissue.      According to some, the traditional chelator challenge test done by some DAN! doctors is also flawed because it involves taking a big dose of a chelator that: a) may dump metals disproportionately that may not be as big of a problem as they seem, and esp. b) redistributes some of the problem metals as it wears off (which it will quickly) and that *can* cause problems in a few cases.  They suggest that a safer challenge is to take smaller doses of the chelator at regular intervals (e.g every 3 hours) for a longer period (e.g. a day) , and collect more urine while you do so.    I have no idea, but I suspect that DAN doctors recommend doing the mega-dose challenges the way they do because: a) they correctly suspect that not everyone would be willing to take pills every 3 hours and collect urine for a day, b) they accomplish their purpose by dumping some metals and hence show that there is a problem, and c) the risk of screwing someone up by redistributing metals with a mega-dose is mitigated by the lower odds of that happening and the potential benefits.    Why bring all these issues up?  Because you\'re a consumer of health services for your kid, and you should be as informed as you can be about treatments, tradeoffs, and risks.  Don\'t go blindly by what anyone tells you and try to understand as much as you can.    DAN doctors provide a great benefit and very often help our kids, but it\'s good to know what you\'re buying esp. since many of the things that DAN doctors are trying have not yet been proven in rigorous, double-blind studies.  [That\'s not saying that saying that there\'s no benefit, but just that what does provide benefit is uncertain.]  Chelators *CAN* be dangerous, yet they probably help.  [We\'re likely to try this now too, using the Cutler protocol.]    I found the following useful to think about&#058;  a) <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.dmpsbackfire.com/default.shtml\">http://www.dmpsbackfire.com/default.shtml</a><!-- m -->, b) <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~moriam/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~moriam/</a><!-- m --></div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">wow, this really hits home. My son is a gazelle when he runs the obstacle course of toys and newspapers in the living room. yet he will bump into people in crowded places (on purpose?) He climbs easily too. Fine motor is not so good though. One thing my O.T. said though and this may ring true with some of you is that even though he can do the \"obstacle course\", he hesitates in terms of \"getting down\" off of a chair. He dosent jump off with ease or confidence, he sort of slides off. He dosent ride his bike as he hasnt figured the pedals yet.     also a strong boy and very well built and very tall (105th percentile) in height.     I noticed when i was researching the wilbarger brushing technique, that parents who were brushing their kids\' legs noticed the muscles relaxing almost instantly, from tight to lax. What they were implying is that these kids\' muscles are constantly taut, like someone said about holding the pencil, they grasp everything as opposed to holding it, due to lack of find motor control. Maybe its the same with the muscles, they might be like a coiled spring, always tensing the muscles thereby developing them. dont know that that is very good for them though as that must indicate some kind of stress i would think    anyway, interesting thread, amazing how many people share the same observations.     respect</div>'

After I took him off dairy, I noticed his poop got a little better, but still the dark circles under his eyes. I have increased zinc and they are still there. Could it be a hidden food allergy?

I have only given him half a capsule of the broad spectrum with meals- I have not started the Zyme Prime yet.  - Should I have him tested for food allergies?

Thank you for all of your devotion to this forum!    My questions are:    Can any kid try Liver Life?  And, if so, where could I get it?  Does it need to be monitored by a DAN or is it self explanatory?    Also, I have taken the advice of many, including you, to try GSE for yeast.  My son has refused it so far and I really think it will help him if I could just get it in him.  I don\'t want to give Diflucan all the time.

I saw huge changes in him with Diflucan, but thought that GSE would be good maintenance with Candex.  This is what I have tried to far...white grape juice with a bit of Stevia (how much per sippy cup??...I got the powder form) and then mix in 2 drops of the GSE (refused).  Today I mixed applesause (a favorite) with stevia again and GSE...he totally  made  a face and spit it back out.  Could I sneak it into a night time sippy cup or could this upset an empty tummy?

I would try something along the lines of salt or baking soda to dry them out, especially in the carpeting. You can take baking soda and work it deep into the carpeting with one of those old fashioned floor waxers that spin in circles. It will kill fleas, so maybe it would take care of carpet beetles. The way it works with fleas is it dries them out rather than outright killing them. They become very active after it is applied and can take a while to kill them all, but the beauty is they don\'t come back for the better part of a year. That is, unless you shampoo your carpets. Then you have to retreat after they dry. Or you can use a Chem Dry method to clean them. If you have a crawl space, the carpenter ants will get underneath the house.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi AD,  I think yeast is a pretty big deal and you have already gotten some advice to deal with it.  I have never used a prescription anti-fungal, just natural and I feel like we have it pretty under control.    I would start with Grapefruit Seed Extract in the am and afternoon, then do a good strong probiotic at night before bed.  For kids with Phenol issues, I have heard that Pau D\'arco is also a good choice.  Also, I did not see zinc on your list of supps, I worked with a feeding specialist and made SCD pancakes for a year to get Zach to eat anything more than the handful of things he liked.  I started him on Zinc (50 mg crushed in a smoothie) and 3 days later he started eating meat.  You may not get those results, \'cause Zach was already only eating SCD (still very limited foods, 5 things tops)  We did get some great tips from the feeding therapist while we worked on him.   I can\'t begin to tell you how much progress I\'ve seen kids make over the last 2 years on SCD or gaps, don\'t rule out this BIG diet change just because your chiild is picky or doesn\'t seem to have gut issues. Zach did not appear to have gut issues, but it has been the #1 intervention we have tried.  It can be a very HARD transition, but if your are willing to get up every 4 hour in the middle of the night, you are tough and can implement these diets <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />  Good luck and don\'t give up!

Then they take dairy and/or gluten away and all of a sudden the stools are a mess.  We didn\'t have that experience as my son\'s stools started off horrid. But we didn\'t think my son had any other food sensitivities until we took the dairy and gluten away as he didnt\' show any obvious symptoms. Once both gluten and dairy were removed, we noticed he was reacting to so many things. Had I not read about this prior to starting the diet, I may have stopped thinking we were causing issues. But in fact the dairy and gluten were masking the other allergies so we couldn\'t see them until the g&amp;d were removed.  One easy way to tell if you are headed in the right direction is if you are seeing progress in other areas. We did as we got the offending foods out of his diet.

' <div class=\"postbody\">If you are hypothyroid, you might find lipoic acid interferes making T3 (active thyroid hormone) from T4 (synthroid, levoxyl) and you could become more hypothyroid. This happened to me, I believe; although I won\'t know for sure until my next set of bloods, drawn after I stopped the lipoic acid.   Effect of alpha-lipoic acid on the peripheral conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine and on serum lipid-, protein- and glucose levels. Segermann J, Hotze A, Ulrich H, Rao GS.  Institute of Clinical Biochemistry, University of Bonn, Fed. Rep. of Germany.  The influence of alpha-lipoic acid (LA, thioctic acid, CAS 62-46-4) on thyroid hormone metabolism and serum lipid-, protein- and glucose levels was investigated. In the first setup of experiments administration of LA together with thyroxine (T4) for 9 days suppressed the T4 induced increase of T3 generation by 56%. This suppression was similar to that affected by 6-propylthiouracil (54%). LA or T4 alone did not affect the cholesterol level, but together they led to a reduction. LA decreased the triglyceride level by 45%; the decrease induced by T4 or LA plus T4 was not significant. Total protein and albumin levels decreased by LA plus T4 treatment when compared to the LA control. The slight increase in glucose level by LA or T4 alone was not observed when they were administered together. In the second setup of experiments the administration of T4 for 22 days increased the serum T3 level 3-fold. When LA was combined with T4 and the treatment continued, the T3 production decreased by 22%. T4 reduced cholesterol level by 30%, and LA plus T4 further reduced it by 47%. The triglycerides were not affected. A moderate decrease in total protein was observed after treatment with T4 plus LA; T4 and LA plus T4 decreased the albumin level. The decrease in serum glucose by T4 recovers by LA treatment. These results demonstrate that LA interferes with the production of T3 from T4 when it is co-administered with T4. The elevated level of T3, after T4 administration, is reduced by treatment with LA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  PMID: 1815532 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]    This is from a peer reviewed medical journal.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">We did have trouble with inositol and yeast -- we were NOT using Kirkman\'s GABA plus.  However, that said, I think the inositol in SMALLER quantitites is okay for my son.  We are now using Spectrum Complete -- which has 15 mg per daily dose.  He seems fine on this.  I think that inositol can be an important supplement for some kids.      We give additional Taurine and GABA and are having good results so far with that combination.  We were giving much higher doses of inositol (like 250 mg) that seemed to give us yeast problems.  LOTS of things feed yeast, though (chelators, B vitamins among them), so the best defense is a good offense -- make sure there is a good yeast protocol in place.      I think it\'s fine to try inositol, but make sure you are giving plenty of biotin, probiotics, and yeast fighters when needed.  I like Saccharomyces Boulardii and Grapefruit Seed Extract when needed.  I also like Kirkman\'s Yeast Aid (daily).  We have had MUCH fewer instances of yeast while using this supplement.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I think once the child is recovered enough to not need any help and is not even sorta Autistic that it becomes a non-issue for their children.  There is no genetic link for most of our children.  That being said I think as they grow up it will be hard to hide the issue from them totally.  My son has years of pictures that you can tell he is most certainly not in reality witht the rest of us.  I think at some point the subject will come up.  I think when it does it then falls on the person to tell their potential spouse about their struggles as a child.  We can hide it all we want and I think in the growing years it can be helpful not to add pressure.  To think you will never ever tell your child about their childhood I think is just silly.  That is the kind of thing that will leave a child hating and not trusting you.  They will have access to their medical records at some point and find out you did not tell them.  Everything has a time and place.  A young child who is recovered might not have the ability to really get it.  I also think you might be underestimating your children.  Like the kid who said he use to be like the one in the cartoon they get it more then we know.  They are highly intelligent and have very long memories.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Respect    Here are 3 articles on B6 and Magnesium that I found    Vitamin B6 (and magnesium) in the treatment of autism  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.autisme.net/vitb6-uk.html\">http://www.autisme.net/vitb6-uk.html</a><!-- m -->    Vitamin B6 in autism: the safety issue  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.autisme.net/b6safe-uk.html\">http://www.autisme.net/b6safe-uk.html</a><!-- m -->    What is the right \'dosage\' for Vitamin B6, DMG,  and other nutrients useful in autism?  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.autisme.net/dosage-uk.html\">http://www.autisme.net/dosage-uk.html</a><!-- m -->    and this quoted from the article on safety  <span style=\"color: blue\">Despite the extraordinary safety of B6, I have been told, over the years, by thousands of parents, that their physicians have warned them against giving their children high doses of B6, because of the supposed risks involved. It is unfortunately very typical of most of the medical establishment (which of course makes its money by prescribing drugs) to denigrate and exaggerate the dangers of taking nutritional supplements.  A case in point: recently the national news media gave heavy coverage to a paper from the University of Michigan which warned the public against the dangers of taking vitamin B6. This report was given national television coverage, and we received a number of alarmed inquiries in our office from parents who were frightened by the warning, \"B6 is toxic!\"  When I read the study, I was truly appalled. The authors, from the University of Michigan Medical School, were supposedly investigating the value of vitamin B6 in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (a painful malady of the wrists, which has become very common in recent years, and is usually considered a repetitive motion injury). The conventional treatment is surgery, which is often ineffective, as well as being disfiguring, expensive, and painful. There have been a number of well-documented reports that high doses of vitamin B6 successfully treat carpal tunnel syndrome, in the majority of cases, so that over a six-week period people who were scheduled for surgery no longer need such drastic treatment.  The Michigan researchers had not given even one milligram of B6 to even one of their subjects (not patients)! Their warning was based primarily on the 1983 Schaumburg report. Further, they had not included even a single subject who actually had carpal tunnel syndrome! They did blood and nerve conduction studies on people who were \"potentially\" at risk for carpal tunnel syndrome, but did not in fact have carpal tunnel syndrome. The anti-vitamin B6 bias in the report is very evident when you read, in their review of research, that \"several\" studies have reported B6 to be effective in treating carpal tunnel syndrome, while \"numerous\" reports have failed to confirm the finding. If you look at the actual references in their study, you will see that there are 12 favorable reports, and only 7 negative reports. So, to them, \"several\" equals 12 and \"numerous\" equals 7!  The University of Michigan study, with its highly publicized and totally irrelevant conclusions, is certainly one of the worst and most appalling studies I have ever read. Alan Gaby, M.D., author of The Doctor\'s Guide to Vitamin B6, referred to it as a \"disgusting\" display of bias, and I certainly agree with that assessment.</span>    I have a feeling that the article you linked too is the same study refuted here.    regards  WD</div>'

Diflucan, nystatin, threelac, sacharomyces boulardi.  Personally all we are doing is nystatin but I am getting ready to do sacharomyces boulardi and then we are going to go to diflucan.

' <div class=\"postbody\">So after many months now of parasite medications, I made a discovery.  We have used both PinX and vermox, and it did HUGE things for eczema, behavior, sleep, and also the rectal itching that I attributed to pinworms.  But the rectal itching several times came back too quickly, with none of the accompanying symptoms.    I was reading the low oxalate diet book (cookbook) the other day, and it cited one of the symptoms of hyperoxalauria as being rectal itching.  We have done the LOD in the past, but have been moving into higher foods over the last year or so.  We went back to low oxalate foods and the itching was gone in a matter of a couple of days.    I really, really feel there is some connection between oxalates and parasites, but I don\'t know what it could be.  The symptoms overlap is big and I don\'t think it\'s a coincidence.  They already know that many people who do the LOD are able to beat the yeast monster after many years of trying, but I have never heard parasites discussed.    Anyway, if any of you are not having success with rectal itching in your kids with the parasite meds, maybe you might consider this.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">We have been doing diet and biomed for about 8 years now, and we have found we\'ve gotten much more progress out of diet and nutrition overall than we have from supplements.  We saw good gains from the supplements that my son tested low on, but that really wasn\'t a very large number.    I have read in the past that the things you keep out of your body are just as important as what you put in.  In almost ALL cases of ASD, there is an issue with gut absorbing nutrients because of some kind of dysbiosis, even if you don\'t seem to have obvious bathroom problems.  Does your child have bad breath?  A white-coated or spotted tongue?  These would be clues to systemic yeast or mold issues.    Our biggest overall gain diet-wise has been staying 100% sugar free.  We do not use honey or other &quot;naturals&quot; either.  We have planned dessert infringements now every week or two, but our diet infringements usually are a sugar-free kind of thing, like pizza.  The sugar always, always kicks off issues again.  We have had to keep both milk and wheat out also.  We do best with no processed foods.  We eat very little fruit; we eat pears, grapefruit juice is our breakfast drink, and golden delicious apples and bananas on occasion are about it.  I would encourage you to start reading books on nutrition if you\'ve hit a wall with biomed.  &quot;Nutrition and Physical Degeneration&quot; by Weston Price is a good place to start; the &quot;Nourishing Traditions&quot; cookbook by Sally Fallon is much more than a cookbook.  It was when I started reading these things that the true causes of ASD and all the degenerative diseases in our culture came into focus for me.  I thought we were eating well; I had no idea how far off we were.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I think those with kidney stones, probably have stones in their livers too. One big caution, you need something to absorb the bile toxins when doing this. AC doesn\'t recommend it, but i\'ve read many benefiting from it. Try  yourself first...apple pectin would be good or the beans to absorb all of the bile toxins released. I think this is the main reason my son does terrible with CLO. I think how they do it is a large dose of olive oil and lemon, this triggers the liver to release a large amount of bile and the stones pass easier with the olive oil and i experienced this very thing with my kidney stone (this is an oxalate thing). I had a big italian meal the night before and I remember adding much more olive oil than usual. My kidney stone passed and it went smoother than I have heard of them passing. Didn\'t know I was triggering a stone to come out at the time. Those pictures of the liver stones totally freak me out. I could see where this would cause the liver to not work too well.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Jen (mom of 3)  <strong><span style=\"color: #00BF00\">iherb referral code: HOF516</span></strong> <em>save $5 on first purchase</em></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Jen (mom of 3)  iherb referral code: HOF516</div>'

(CARD).  The three-year study, which the State of Arizona funded and CARD, the world\'s largest provider of early intensive behavioral intervention for children with autism, conducted, evaluated the effects of behavioral intervention for 14 young children with autism using a version of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) that blends structured teaching with play-based behavioral intervention.

I have also noted that on the days (3 of them) that I forgot to give it to him, he had a rougher, more sensory day at school and was less focused.  For him, less focused means not willing to sit at his desk, needing prompting to do his worksheets, and staring in space at times.    In the begining he was on it every other day because it made him hyper beyond belief, after about 2 weeks I started him on everyday and have not had any hyper behaviors.    My bottle is going into its second month, it cost $45 plus I think $11 for shipping.  I ordered in the begining, now that there is such a demand I wonder if the price has gone down?  Though $45 for 2 months is still very reasonable!    Our first spray or 2 left behind a little red ring around his nostril, now we are old pros and it all ends up there!

Every once and a while, we would splurge and get something with a bit of fat in it.  Without fail, we would both wind up in the bathroom with terrible diarreah.  However, when we were not restricting our fat intake so dramatically, we were much better at tolerating occasional fatty foods.  Similarly, my sister has been a vegetarian for a few years, but had tried to eat meat on a couple of occasions, and found she could not tolerate it.  Meat never gave her any problems before her lifestyle change.  I have actually wondered about this for a while, because I have considered whether or not my son my see some benefits from a GFCF diet.  I started thinking about the idea that your body produces enzymes to break down the foods that you typically eat, but what if you no longer eat these foods, does your body still produce these enzymes to the same degree?  If your body is producing fewer and fewer enzymes to a substance such as gluten, and then you reintroduce gluten to your diet, I would think that you would initially have a terrible reaction do to a potentially lower production of enzymes.  I know that in many Asian countries, for example, where dairy products are rarely used, many more people are lactose intolerant than we are here in the Western world with our relatively high dairy intake.  Of course, there will always be some people with poor enzyme production, regardless of their diet, and someone who is seriously deficient may need to remove the offending food completely.  However, what about someone who has only a minor sensitivity and is only reactive when a very large amount of a certain food is consumed?  Perhaps, ensuring that intake is not too high might be a more preferable option to completely eliminating the food in this case.  Maybe some people will do fine with the addition of enzymes and not have to really alter their diet at all?</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Getting a DAN! doc can be an interesting problem.  We have used 2, and are now working with my son\'s pediatrician (she attended the last DAN! conference physician training).  If you can find a local pediatrician who either has an autistic child or is willing to try the DAN! protocol with your child, I would do that.  The travel to the DAN! doc for us was a huge hassle (and we only had to go an hour and a half each way)!!  We are much happier working with his regular pediatrician and only traveling when we have to.    That being said, many docs only see your child once or twice a year and then do most of their consultation via email or phone.  That may be an option for you as well.  I don\'t want to tell you NOT to see a DAN! doc because it was very beneficial for us.  I just wanted to let you know that there are other options (ask Dana <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />  )    If you are planning biomedical treatments (which is why you are here I assume), buy this book:    \"Autism: Effective Biomedical Treatements\" by Pangborn and Baker.  This is like a biomed encyclopedia.

They should really have it posted on the main page.  Anyway, here\'s the C&amp;P from the facebook page:  Autism Canada is in receipt of the letter directly from Kirkman that has been sent to its distributors regarding select products that contain substandard quality materials. Please read the Kirkman letter below. Please also note that Autism Canada has learned that the ingredient in question was a stevia ingredient so please consider investigating your own stevia supply sources if you are using stevia.  Dec 30, 2009  Dear Kirkman Distributor,  It has come to Kirkmanâ€™s attention that a raw material supplier has been supplying Kirkman with substandard quality material that is higher in antimony content than what would be considered acceptable to the special needs community. Raw material supplier are actually not required to test for antimony levels routinely, so this problem did not come to our attention until a physician using Kirkman products brought the issue to our attention. We immediately had our laboratory research the issue which they quickly isolated and linked it to a specific raw material.  We have stopped using this material and have located and purchased a quality replacement which we will begin using immediately.  We are asking that if you have any of the following products which utilized this material in your inventory, that you destroy the products and request credit or replacement with new lots when they become available. Call Kirkman customer service to make these requests. The products involved include all lots of the following products:  1. Zinc Liquid Product #387/8 and 387/16 2. Super Nu-Thera w/o A and D Product #447/454 3. DMAE 50 mg. Chewable Product # 489/90 4. Super Nu-Thera Powder-Orange Product # 410/454 5. B Complex Powder Pro Support Product # 399/7 6. TMG w/ Folinic and B-12 Powder Product #413/4 and 389/250 7. Chewable Vitamin C Tablets Product #389/100 and 389/250  Kirkman regrets the inconvenience associated with this issue, but Kirkman will not compromise our quality standards that we have stood for throughout our existence.

' <div class=\"postbody\">We are still fighting parasites, and I wanted to do a quick update.  We have really, really lost ground these last months, and I have been at a loss as to what\'s wrong.  But the pinworm symptoms are always rearing their ugly heads, so we have been working on this.  We have done several rounds of natural treatments, with symptoms always coming back, and then last month I did three days of PinX for the whole family, and then three more days two weeks later to \"clean up\" any eggs, etc.  We went to our DAN and I commented on how the parasite treatment seemed to help so much, especially the last time we did Vermox (an Rx that we did many months ago.)  She gave me an Rx for the whole family for Vermox this time, and we\'ve been taking it several days now (the Rx is for 2 chewable tablets daily for three days.)      Today we are dumping out large amounts of worms!!  Also, the stool looks grainy and sandy, like what we have seen with oxalate dumps--truly almost the same, and I am now wondering if these \"seed\" or crystal-looking things were oxalate crystals or parasite eggs (or whatever it is I\'m seeing!)  Again, I want to stress that this is after doing PinX for six days last month.  The PinX obviously didn\'t clear the parasites, though I did indeed see some small evidence of worms in the stools.  Just a couple, though.    So I wonder now....are these some wierd kind of worm that was not gotten by the other meds?  My husband travels internationally, and he actually was the catalyst for my gettin the Vermox--he has been REALLY off his game, but PinX helped him very much, so I am fairly sure he picked up something in China.    I believe Rainman\'s father was an international businessman, by the way.  I\'ve always wondered if he brought home a mold or parasite from where he travelled.    I haven\'t had it in me to get the artemesia and clove or the diatomaceous earth Tami has recommended; I have only gotten the parasite kits at the HFS.  So much money down the drain--pinX isn\'t cheap, either.      But this and getting back on board with 4x/day nystatin has given me back my normal child again after 6 months of a real mess.  I suspect  the apartment we are in has big, big issues with mold and stuff--and I fear this sent us back into a bad, bad place.  We move in 5 weeks.

I think biomed helped him some, but this is so different. And sometimes it feels so effortless compared to all the endless supplements. I\'ll see how he does as we start to run out of the few he\'s still on. I\'m also planning on starting to juice more often so that will also help.  I think the hardest part is figuring out dosing. I think I\'m starting to get the hang of it. It can be confusing if you don\'t see a pattern right away and it\'s a very individual thing.  During our follow-up, I told Pierre that he was doing well, but that yeast was still an issue although it it seems like it was becoming less so. We\'ve seen more poop than bad lately which is a big improvement. He thought about it and told us to go without antifungals and probiotiocs because it can interfere with what the remedy is doing. I totally freaked. Well, it\'s been almost 5 days and so far so good. I\'ve had to be more aggressive with dosing and we had a flare before I realized this, but it seems to be working. He did have beans tonight which usually creates a lot of yeast and did seem to have another flare, so I started dosing more again and it seemed to calm him down. I still can\'t believe that I\'m not  giving a slew of antifungals and probiotics all day long - that I\'m not giving any at all. I thought we\'d surely crash without them. I\'ve heard that it usually takes a few months to see yeast go away, so it looks like we\'re on track at 1 month in.  I just can\'t wait to see what the following weeks and months bring.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">HI,  Galantamine will be the agent that directly affects the acetylcholine  receptors by inhibiting the enzyme which breaks down (catabolizes) acetylcholine, namely acetylcholine esterase (AChe).  Piracetam can affect acetylcholine receptors (muscarinic ones to be specific), but it probably is understood to affect the NMDA(one of the types of receptors to which glutamate binds; others are AMPA and Kainate ) receptors onto which glutamate binds.  Although racetams (like piracetam) have been around for about 30 years, many of their mechanisms of action are unknown.  At least, it is known that they are non toxic and reversible even in mega doses. If you read the following article, piracetam has a structure resembling the neurotransmitter, GABA.  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracetam\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracetam</a><!-- m -->  It is imperative that the patient have a balanced relationship of glutamate to GABA before supplementing with piracetam.  Otherwise, glutamate will skyrocket and so will stims.  Incidentally, glutamate is instrumental in intelligence and learning.  However, in excess it will serve as an excitotoxin which can cause neuron damage/death.  For this reason, it is not recommended to consume MSG (monosodium glutamate; the salt form of glutamate).  Some foods like tomatoes, parmesan, anchovies, corn, seaweed/algae, milk, wheat are naturally high in glutamate.    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\"> my daughter started frothing at the mouth, bending her head to the side and rigidly flexing her muscles  </div>  This definitely sounds like excess acetylcholine, however.  She may not be ready for piracetam. Rigid muscles and frothing are the tell-tale sign of this.  Concomitant to this, her dopamine levels might be low.  There is a relationship of ACh/dopamine.  Here, you might want to ask your doctor for an appropriate low dose of piracetam and you may wish to add in a low dose of an anticholinergic drug like, benadryl.

' <div class=\"postbody\">We started my daughter on primal defense today at a half of a caplet.  She got a fever about 2 hours after that.  Her body is so hot, although her head is cooler.  She is just laying around right now.  Do you think it is die-off or the immune system being activated?  Maybe a combo of both I guess.  I looked through old posts and see that this has happened to other people as well.  I tried to start with a 1/4 to and 1/8 but those stupid caplets kind of crumble when you cut them!   Anyway, I know that I don\'t hear much about this probiotic lately but it is one we are trying.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #FF00FF\"> Mommy to: 7 yr old girl 6 yr old girl with ASD 3 yr old girl New Baby boy ~</span></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________  Mommy to: 7 yr old girl 6 yr old girl with ASD 3 yr old girl New Baby boy ~</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Amanda.    Ian was a little better today. Not as giggly, but still silly, goofy behavior. This used to occur quite a bit, but the last month it is all the time. We live in southern cal, so I don\'t know if he has any allergies. He rarely sneezes or has a cold, never watery eyes. He does have dark circles sometimes.    He is till up and down, calm, then silly, great language, then giggly. I just can\'t get a handle on it. It started around tratment 8 of hbot, and 2 weeks before we had him on the keto and nystatin.    Just last week we put him back on banannas and cherries. You read my post on fruit, we just dont see and wows when he is off it. We took him off all grains for the first time ever. He was on gf/cf, soy, egg free for a year, and we just did not see a wow. We put everything back in for 4 mos, and no regression. We started back 2 months ago \"just to see\", and nothing. This is obviouslly the wrong diet for us. This is what he is eating, banannas, cherries, chicken, turkey and cheddar cheese. Thats all. Since we did not see anything great from gf cf, we let him have this dairy item. He is also taking his meds with pure cranb juice, and acacia. What do you think of this? I read the post on the other diet that limits fruit and meat... I read all the great things that happened.    I ordered liver life, ndf and the ph strips today. I also had some 5htp, so this is my first new med I am introducing this week. I am also going to try cocobiotic and aloe vera juice.     His silliness, short fuse aren\'t improving any even with the yeast meds, diet,  hbot etc, so I am obviouslly missing something. He is often hyper and sometimes silly, but short fuse, (like he threw a plastic bucket in the car today when he was upset), that just isn\'t something that we see often, but the last month all three of these things occur daily. I read about the oxolate dumping... could it last a month?  the thing with his yeast is that his clostridia was moderately eleveted, and hppa more so.    I have been reading about inflamation, histamines, etc... maybe I should give him motrin? I have never tried this. I am wondering now if all the silliness ,giggling short fuse are not yeast after all. If not, then what?      Tanya</div>'

I had a feeling that mold may be an issue but we don\'t have any here since it rains very little.....  He takes a probiotic on occassion when he eats gluten which helps, but I don\'t give it to him everyday!!!  I suspect enviro toxins are an issue, he takes Glutithione and that seems to help his mood as well as inositol (good for liver detox)....Have you ever tried clay baths, when he was compliant for them, they really helped!!!!  I will never do chelation on him - he is too sensitive, we are doing a more gentle detox program with the nutri-energetics...it helps but it is so slow!!!  Thanks for all of your suggestions....if you come by any new ideas, I am all ears.....</div>    Oh honey, I feel for you.  My son too suffers from extreme rage and anger at times, but not to that degree.  I\'m so sorry you are going through this right now.    Just wondering, could your son be reacting to the meds?  My son can\'t tolerate any kind of prescription medicine right now.  His gut is just too sensitive.    I would make sure you are giving him his probiotic everyday.  It really sounds like your son could be struggling with viral issues and maybe environmental issues as well.  Also, you may want to look up P.A.N.D.A.S. Disorder.  It\'s basically strep that attacks the basal ganglia in the brain.  Some children have these types of symptoms: symptoms can come on very suddenly, sensitivity to touching and clothing tags, poor attention span, distractibility, irritability, impulsivity, separation anxiety, anxiety when changing routines, obsessive compulsiveness, and rage and anger are only some of the symptoms of Pandas.  The test you ask for would be Anti-Streptolysin(ASO titer test and DNASE-B Antibody test.  These are not very expensive tests, and your insurance should pay for them.  I would also check  his viral titers as suggested by Jaquelyn McCandless in her book Children With Starving Brains.  The ones we checked were: Herpes Virus 1&amp;2(IgG, and IgM), Herpes Simplex 6(IgG &amp;IgM), Epstein Barr Virus(IgG &amp; IgM), Measles antibodies(IgG &amp;IgM-my son\'s IgG was elevated), and Cytomegalovirus(IgG &amp; IgM).  My son\'s Herpes 6 IgG level was also elevated.  I know my child is a viral child, but will not start him on Viastop and Olive Leaf Extract until I can clear some of the toxins out of his liver first.  We have him on Essiac Tea right now and are seeing some good results.  I know it is getting rid of some of the environmental toxins and allergens he is sensitive to.  I really believe mold is a huge problem for my son right now.  I\'m also suffering from issues as well.  Everytime the weather is humid and we have to run our air conditioners, I completely lose my son again.  It\'s very frustrating!!      Did your son just suddenly start acting like this or has he just recently started with this horrible rage? Is he maybe going through puberty?  I know some children on the spectrum can get worse when the hormones start circling through their bodies.      Have you ever had his Neurotransmitters checked?  Low serotonin and dopamine can lead to problems with behavior too.  We have used a supplement called GABA (powder form) 500-750mg that has helped my son\'s nerves.  You could tryL-theanine, GABA, or 5HTP to help with is dopamine production if it is low.  I would test before supplementing because some children can be high in dopamine which would aggravate the situation if you gave him a supplement like this and his levels turned up elevated.    What does his diet look like?  Is he Gluten and Casein Free?  What about food additives?  Have you tried the Feingold Diet?  I would recommend keeping a Food Journal and behavior journal, then you could figure out if food was the culprit for your son\'s aggresion problems.  I do this with my son; it has proved to be very helpful.        I would also look into running a heavy metal serum test. Your insurance should also cover this test as well.  My son had symptoms of rage and falling out for no reason at all.  He suddenly started having sensory issues and major screaming fits.  I knew something was wrong.  After prodding our Allergist numerous times he finally ordered the heavy metal screen and found Noah\'s arsenic level at 165mcg!!  That was his blood level!!      I don\'t blame you for not wanting to chelate your son, but you can try some other natural ways like the clay baths and just by cleaning his liver out.  Have you tried the Liver Life from Bioray yet?  As soon as I finish the Essiac Tea I\'m going to put Noah on it and then gently detox him on NDF(nautral chelator from Bio-ray) when his body is ready.  I will do some Anit-viral therapy first before I chelate him.      I have written alot, but don\'t be overwhelmed, I know it\'s hard dealing with all of this.  Our children\'s bodies are so out of whack, so it\'s really hard to know how to help them sometimes.  My son used to be alot like your son is now, but he has improved with hard work and a lot of research on my part. Sometimes it also takes not listening to a \"Mister Know-it all doctor, at least in our situation.  Don\'t give up and keep trying to help your son.  There is a reason he is acting like this, be a detective and journal everything he eats and takes by mouth.  Look for reactions to food and meds. I would think maybe the medicine is too harsh on his system, but that\'s just my honest opinion.  I\'m not saying to stop his medicines by no means, just monitor him for reactions and behavior changes.  The first sign of my boy acting out, I know something is triggering it such as; mold spores, seasonal allergens, or a undected food allergen.  Keep your head up.  I\'m praying for you and your son.

' <div class=\"postbody\">So funny you post this!  I have a friend who has had a good bit of stress and is getting atleast one a month.  It is very upsetting to her I will recommend she try this.  Acutally I will go out and buy it for her and give it to her tell her to try and see which one works will try the first one the next time she complains.    I have been talking about my son but I also got a remedy for me.  I have suffered from Depression for over 20 years.  I have been on every med you can think of and even many off label.  I started my remedy on Monday and though I am still having CFS I am not depressed about it in the least.  This is pretty amazing.  I hope I have hit on something here cause the Dr\'s are really of no use to me.  I had this thought for a brief moment last night.  I wonder what it would be like to not have to take any meds at all.  I can\'t remember a time in my adult life where I was not on something for sleep, anxiety, or depression.  To literally not have to take a pill a day would be so wonderful.  Will have to wait for this one to finish it job then I am going after the CFS.    Thanks for starting a post about us!  It can be very hard to take care of ourselves when we are so busy with our kids.  Easy to forget.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Diva and the other anti \"recovery\" blogger have the benefit of complaining on a web site. Will my son have that opportunity? Just like the rest of the aspies on the aspies for freedom who are adults and have access to computers and obviously are literate. Will my son have that opportunity, to get on a web forum and sling criticisms at parents. Well, to be honest, if he did, I would have a lot to say about that. But he still deserves that opportunity, if you know what I mean.     Unless I help him, autism will take him, the thing that brought autism will take him, and finally the \"state\" will take him when I am dead and gone and there is nobody to look after him. He wont be a blogger, he wont be slinging insults (except perhaps at his \"minders\") What a horrible horrible scenario to even contemplate.     I see Diva does not have the courage of her convictions to come back to this forum. She has scuttled away under the rock from which she came. I am sure she knows that we as parents have courage of our convictions and arent just slobbering and foaming at the mouth for the sake of it.     by the way i read the aspies for freedom site. Rarely have i read such smug, self satisfied posts. Is this part of having aspergers? I doubt it. I just think we have a group of uninformed, pissed off people who found an easy target, namely us parents who are trying to recover our kids. So many other things in the world to spend ones energy on, and they chose us. Pathetic really. Really really sad. I pray that they just get some knowledge and start examining their own consciences. They are basically taking their bad experiences out on us, the people who are least deserving of their venom.     Typical blame the \"victim\" stuff going on here with them. Diva, just go away and kick your cat or something but leave this forum alone and try to find a good psychoanalyst cause I think you are just a tad disturbed and way too much time on your hands dear.</div>'

Now he eats them.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />      She treated him for HM. Within two days he had horrible flu, confirmed by a test, his hands and feet were numb, just like when he was poisoned on seafood and he bacame very dyslexic. He would revearse occasional nembers but after treatment he strarted reversing his majority of his numbers and many letters. It was pretty freaky. Within a week of treatment it went away, so now he is writing normally.     Anyway, just wanted to see if your son was treated for HM and what was observed.    I wonder if the treatment made him \"dump\" HM and that is what has caused that temporary regression.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Doâ€™C - Thank you; I really appreciate your questions â€¦     I always find myself in a limbo; mom of autistic kid and a scientist working in the lab â€¦  As a scientist I want to see data, double blind studies with promising results â€¦    But as a parent I do not question and critique enough   â€¦.why is that?  I think because we; the parents, hope so much for a cure and because the â€œmainstreamâ€ docs have no tools to help usâ€¦ I was told by pediatrician (before my sonâ€™s diagnosis) that if indeed my son was autistic there was no cure and nothing we could do to help him â€¦ hell... she did not even mentioned Early Intervention or ABA â€¦ that was 4 years ago and we live in central NJ ...  you can imagine how desperate a parent can be and doing SOMETHING feels better that just giving up â€¦.    There is also an issue of some DAN docs EGOS and parents are simply afraid of â€œgetting firedâ€ â€¦ maybe we think â€œmy pediatrician cannot help, I finally found the doctor who is interested enough to help my child, so what that he is full of himself â€¦ I better be quiet and do not question himâ€â€¦    And I do wonder about â€œpushingâ€ certain treatments to parentsâ€¦if a doctor puts a lot of money into equipment naturally he will want to make profit.   The treatments that promise no cure, the treatment which always have to be implemented or â€œyour kid slips backâ€ are the ultimate money makers.   It is nothing new â€¦big pharm companies do this all the time â€¦ why should they work on ex. new antibiotic which a patient will need it for 10 daysâ€¦..they can put money into development ex. Cholesterol lowering drug which  a patient will take it for the rest of his life â€¦     So where this live me; a mom of autistic kid who has great days and darker days. And it is so scary to see him slip back to his world after weeks of being happy kid...     Anyway, we, the parents, should all critique and question more, not only doctors, but also schools, therapists working with our kids â€¦ so thank you Doâ€™C for your posts.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">With something topical, you should see a rash much more quickly, not 3 days. I have always assumed it was three days, because it can take that long for things to work to the surface when it has been ingested internally.    My oldest daughter recently got a rash all over her chest and back after starting the HMD. I thought maybe it was an initial reaction to chelation. I would be surprised if it were the Omega\'s, especially since you are seeing a speech improvement. I would not expect to see improvement if something were disturbing him. Maybe someone else can weigh in if it is possible to have too much EFA\'s.    One time my youngest\'s face swelled up after handling my friend\'s yorkshire terrier that had just gotten a bath! Are you using different laundry detergent, bath soap, anything else?    Tie into what Recovering Nicholas said, maybe he is clearing something out of his system.    I am assuming the doctor knows what he is doing, but what kind of oatmeal bath? One of my friend\'s with celiac can\'t even inhale gluten (as in going into Subway or a bakery where they are baking bread), let alone put it on her skin. Unless he gave me a good reason for using an oatmeal bath, I wouldn\'t try it. I know he had the rash first, but my youngest, at 5 weeks, broke out from head to toe just from me eating oatmeal.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I started the green smoothies for my son 8 weeks ago but because of the fruit in the smoothies, I started juicing 4 weeks ago with veggies.  I have seen great improvements.  This will help decrease inflammation in the gut and help cleanse the blood.   kale is a great detoxifier and cucumber.  Be careful of the watermelon its great for cleansing but the yeast really like the sugar in watermelon.   The improvements I have seen in the last few weeks have been wonderful I hope you keep juicing.  Also my son started pooping 1 to 2 times a day with the juicing so I added in homemade coconut milk yoghurt last week and he pooped 5 times yesterday.  You would think that a child that pooped 1 to 2 times a day would not be backed up but they are and he has pooped 2 times today with the last poop being solid. You can tell that the yeast is getting pushed out along with the bad bacteria.   Keep up the juicing the vitamins will help him heal and alkalize the body.   Watch out for alkaloids in the greens do a different green every few days.  Like spinach one day and kale the next.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">It indicates that the dose was too high.  Do you remember what dose you gave?  From what I\'ve read, galantamine prevents the break down of acetylcholine so my best guess would be either your son had enough acetylcholine to begin with (or his levels were high) or else the starting dose you gave may have been too much for him.  Our kids are all so different.  Some people report such great success with Methyl B12 and my son didn\'t respond to nasal Methyl B12 at all.  Nothing (that\'s been awhile back when a friend let me have some she ordered for her son).  Here\'s a partial list of overdose symptoms:  Taking an overdose of galantamine may lead to convulsions (seizures) or shock. Some signs of shock are large pupils, irregular breathing, and fast weak pulse. Other signs of an overdose are severe nausea and vomiting, increasing muscle weakness, greatly increased sweating, and greatly increased watering of the mouth.  So I guess it\'s galantamine, not Namenda, that can cause problems with people prone to seizures.  For us it has been wonderful, but it\'s one of those supplements that she be used with great caution, I think.  It also interacts negatively to SSRI\'s and many other medications, so that could have been an issue as well.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">If your son is on lipoic acid, he IS chelating.  It is not bad to be on lipoic acid (necessarily).  However, lipoic acid, also known as Alpha Lipoic Acid or ALA, should be used with caution in individuals who have known or suspected heavy metal issues.  Also, it should NOT be given as just a vitamin (amino acid).  Many who use it give it in 3 hour intervals at a low dose 1/8 to 1/2 mg per pound of body weight -- though there is some disagreement about this (I tend to agree this is the safest method).    ALA can also be the abbreviation of alpha LINEOLIC acid as well (which is an essential fatty acid), so don\'t get them confused (as if this is not already too confusing).    I would make sure to give lipoic acid at a low dose and a frequent dose (every 3 hours during the day and every 4 hours at night) and would not give it every day (at least at first) but give it over 3 to 4 days with as many days off it.      Also be aware that Lipoic Acid CAN cause yeast problems.  The latest DAN chelation position paper states that they no longer recommend Lipoic Acid because of the bad yeast issues.  However, many docs still give it because it will clear metals out of the brain -- whereas DMSA and DMPS do not (the way I understand it).    We were more comfortable starting with NDF Plus first.  We are now using DMSA with NDF Plus and will probably add Lipoic Acid in a few months with the DMSA/NDF Plus combination.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">We haven\'t started AC yet, and we had OSR here and tried it 3 days. Really bad yeast flare, bad all around for us. So, I looked into something not as dramatic to start maybe at least grabbing onto what gets circulated into the blood with yeast/bacteria die-off from the gut. Found MCP. I think it is really helping. Not on any grand scale, but I feel better giving SOMETHING until I\'m ready to dive in to chelation. I do think AC is probably safer. Just scared about yeast since it is just so bad here. my son is so toxic that he has seizures when we use OSR. Happened the two times I tried it. With little amount and I actually gave spaced out throughout the day, similar to AC so that we avoid any possible redistribution. It just stirs up yeast too bad. Anyway, I think a good mopper-upper is a great way to start. One that binds in the gut to metals, not charcoal. I really don\'t think charcoal does this for metals. Modifilan, bentonite or MCP will do this. Alginates, clays. etc. Just thought I\'d add that even a mild one that doesn\'t go into the tissues could be of help. This in my opinion should be standard with treating yeast and bacteria. Metals get released everytime you kill yeast. everytime. So even if you\'re not chelating you are redistributing metals treating the gut in any kind of way. We are all afraid of redistribution, but we do it all the time just treating the gut bugs, viruses and yeasts. just my 2Â¢  Jen</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Jen (mom of 3)  <strong><span style=\"color: #00BF00\">iherb referral code: HOF516</span></strong> <em>save $5 on first purchase</em></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Jen (mom of 3)  iherb referral code: HOF516</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">vnm4flan,    Thank you so much for translating the customs document for me and for recommending that I visit another office before heading to the airport to pick up the MB12 shots that were delayed in customs. You were right on.    So, it took five hours, but I was able to get my son\'s MB12 shots. It turned out that I did need a document from the department listed on the sheet. In fact, I had to visit a desk there several times while filling out forms, getting photocopies, and visiting another official in between. That part took a little over two hours. Once I got to the courier section of the airport, it tooks several visits to another desk with visits to customs and a waiting room in between. The box was just about in my hands when the person at UPS told us that I could not accept the box since the prescription was for my son, not me, and I would need a notarized document from him saying I could pick it up. Fortunately, someone from work came with me and she explained that my som was three years old and would be unable to complete such a document. With a big sigh of relief, I finally had the box in hand and the contents were still cold. My coworker went above and beyond to help me today and I have to think of an appropriate gist to that her.    Thank you again for translating!    Becky</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\"><span style=\"color: darkblue\">Forgive me for my non-technical explanations cause I may not know the proper terminology, but would like to try to add to the topic. Yes an environment setting, either over enriched or lack of stimuli can effect stimming. Many external factors and changes in the environment can also trigger it. <em>  But mostly stimming is an over reactive copping mechanism within the person to the outside world. Children stim for many reasons to express in some sort of way to: Compensate or to help calm down, adjusting from hypersensitivity or even keep occupied when not engaged in external stimuli.</em>  We all stim in some sort of way but most of ours is considered social acceptable, it is our way to adjust or cope with the external situations. And example would be bite our nails, drum or tap on a table fidget with something in our hands. Twirl our hair etcâ€¦ you will notice when people are mostly nervous they do these types of stimming, but also when they are board as well. Sometimes you can teach a replacement behavior with a stim, and it would be more appropriate also social acceptable. Often times you will be teaching them to exhibit themselves properly and communicate more effectively instead of stimming. Try to assess what the purpose of the stim is for before trying to counteract it. Understand its function.   Sometimes if you force them NOT to stim they may pick a worse one than what you brought to extinction.  I say choose your battles. And as they mature and detox they will do this less and less.  IMO as far as my child and his self-stimulus behavior he used to stim big time all the time with finger flapping, jumping in place, and eyes to an object and so onâ€¦â€¦ Today his stimming has disappeared pretty much all together I believe as he matured learned functional language and detoxed all of these behaviors started to fade.

They will specifically test for Celiac in order to test for the gluten intolerance.     When I get the results I will know more how to fine tune his diet. His pediatrician agreed to order the testing due to his severe constipation but basically told he wasn\'t on board with the biomedical approach and if the test showed anything I would have to take him to the DAN doctor in Asheville, NC for treatment. I\'m not sure if I should be really mad or not...or hurt...because why can\'t a pediatrician treat someone who has food allergies/sensitivities if he truly has them???

Lead will cause the cell to actually leak and membrane damage to the cells, ironicly both of these metals inhibit vitamin D and Zinc in the body, which it seems your daughter is low in, my son was too. Even tiny amounts of lead are something to address right away. No mercury on blood and hair results can actually mean tons of mercury and it\'s all not being excreted because it loves to settle into the brain, nervous system or any other fatty organ. It stays there too unless something pulls it out for many ASD kids. Certain types of bacteria actually feed on copper sulfate like phisteria-they hold onto it in the gut and then there\'s none left for the body to use. This is the cause of toxic algae blooms on the coast and in waterways that are close to agriculture where there\'s lots of fungicide runoff.   The younger, the better to get these metals and toxins out. A stricter diet may also be in order.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi, I took my daughter (22-rett syndrome) to a homeopathic center in the city we live a couple of weeks ago to see if they could be of help with reflux and intestinal pain issues as she hasn\'t tolerated any traditional PPI or reflux meds.   She was a wonderful lady and took very detailed history.  She came up with the remedy &quot;Oreo 30c&quot;.  She had us put 15 pellets(very tiny ones) in 2 ounces of distilled water, let dissolve, stir for 30 sec. then give her 1 tsp of that mixture.  We did that in the morning and as the day went on, my daughters reflux got noticeably worse.  She was curled up to the left crying, constant spitting, gurgling and chin getting very red, sore from all the salvia.  By evening time we decided we needed to antidote which I remember the homeopath talking about and that also talked about in directions given.  So we had her smell Vicks vapor rub and the crying stopped after doing that and she was able to fall asleep.  The next day was an amazing day for her with absolutely no screaming/crying/spitting/curled up at all.  I couldn\'t believe it but then the next 4 days again were very hard.  Worse than before the remedy.  We talked to the homeopath and she feels this is the right remedy but to try at a lower potency so she sent us &quot;Oreo 12c&quot; and had us give her one dose of this which was 15 pellets (very tiny ones) mixed again in 2 oz. distilled water and then gave her 1 tsp. of that mixture. And to call her back in 3 days.  This time we gave it to her at bedtime.  She fell asleep calmly and next day was OK, some up and down but then the day after that was terrible!!.  Lots of reflux pain, could hear the gurgling, abdomen bloated and tons of gas pain.  She was screaming/sobbing throughout the day.  Then the next day was better with some episodes. We are hoping to talk to her today. Is this just a homeopathic aggravation that won\'t do any lasting harm or is this a reaction to the remedy that warrants not doing again?  I am concerned that both times given that she had such a significant/painful reaction and am concerned that the &quot;aggravations&quot;  is resulting in more damage to her esophagus. Would appreciate any thoughts.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Culturelle is great. It will keep bacteria away, which is why there\'s probably green poop. Give lots of it with enhansa to keep bacteria at bay. Enhansa is a great supplement. We stil use it off and on. I honestly wouldn\'t do natural chelation. AC is very safe and slow. Once you figure things out and know how your child reacts to yeast and bacteria and have it kind of under control, then look into AC if you can. It\'s not harsh or dangerous really...if you follow it correctly and use the support supplements to protect as metals come out.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Jen (mom of 3)  <strong><span style=\"color: #00BF00\">iherb referral code: HOF516</span></strong> <em>save $5 on first purchase</em></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Jen (mom of 3)  iherb referral code: HOF516</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">We\'ve been using the respen-a for 3 mos now and didn\'t really make any changes with our other supplements. Our DAN! felt that the other supps were really important and that the company wasn\'t very specific when they said not to give &quot;high&quot; amounts of antioxidants and such. My daughter needs the antioxidants because we are doing hyperbarics as well.  We did run bloodwork after 2mos of using the respen-a and her blood calcium levels didn\'t drop at all. We\'ve been supplementing 1500mgs of cal citrate/carbonate. I know the pharmacy is recommending all carbonate but we like the citrate because of oxalate issues and it worked just fine.  My daughter\'s vitamin D levels went up from 39 to 58 but we had been supplementing 3000iu\'s daily for the 6 mos. prior so it\'s hard to tell if any of that could be attributed to the patch.  Not sure about the gut issues but she does seem to be doing better in that arena. We are on a supplement break right now so off of probios but my daughter is a mystery kid and doesn\'t really seem to do better either way. We are currently running some other tests to see what is going on with her.  Overall though, the respen-a has been in our top 2 for interventions we\'ve tried. We saw a jump in cognitive scores, decreased anxiety, much more affection, she seems to recognize emotions (ie: children crying)......and she just seems happier. It\'s been a good one for us! I don\'t know if they told you, but make sure your son eats at least one serving of meat a day or you could see sleep issues due to a drop in seratonin.   Oh, almost forgot, my daughter doesn\'t have a lot of stims other than running around my house nonstop all day long. We haven\'t seen any decrease in that or hyperactivity. Not sure about visual stims though. -Amber</div>'

Helps with blood flow in the vessels too, not by increasing blood flow, but better control in the vessels. Sounds like a good one to me. It\'s in biciden.

Further, that few chemicals can create so much havoc in the body as acetaldehyde can. It may interfere with the receptors for acetylcholine which is supposedly the major neurotransmitter in the corpus callosum.     Formaldehyde, obviously then, is related to acetaldehyde in the aldehyde chain of chemicals.     Dr. Stephen Rochlitz worked with cross-crawl brain integration exercises with dyslexic patients with formaldehyde taped to these patients right brain hemisphere, and sometimes the left.     Acetaldehyde is a fungal waste product.     Dr. Stephen Cooter, in his book &quot;Beating Chronic Disease&quot;, ProMotion Publishing, San Diego, California, states that &quot;Candida is responsible for flooding the system with an accumulation of toxic acetaldehydes. Acetaldehydes are known to poison tissues -- accumulating in the brain, spinal cord, joints, muscles and tissues.&quot;     Dr. Cooter then goes on to describe how he learned from a chiropractor, Dr. Carol Cooper [this name came up on this List way back] that molybdenum -- a mineral -- not a medication, but a nutrient, had a blanket reputation for breaking down yeast by-products into forms that the body could excrete. Coincidentally, Dr. Cooter read the monogram by Dr. Walter Schmitt &quot;Molybdenum for Candida Albicans Patients and Other Problems&quot; through Dr. Cooper. [Interestingly, these are all chiropractor, Drs. Roschlitz, Cooper, and Schmitt.]     I\'m beginning to see a glimmer of some possible connections here. Dr. Roschlitz\'s work, and Dr. Walter Schmitt\'s, although slightly different, seems similar to me to the principle of Dr. Nambupridad\'s work with NAET, and perhaps then, holding the substance, when the body is worked on through one of their modalities, might not seem so strange after all. I think I see a common denominator here. Worth exploring? Perhaps....     Back to Dr. Cooter and Dr. Schmitt: &quot;Molybdenum is chemically responsible for breaking down acetaldehyde into acetic acid. Acetaldehyde cannot be excreted from the body; it accumulates. Acetic acid can be, though, and the body naturally removes it or changes it into acetyl coenzyme A, a major player in the body\'s energy system.... Acetaldhyde accumulations in tissue are responsible for weakness in muscles, irritation, and PAIN.&quot;     And now for the good part (g), directly quoted from Dr. Walter Schmitt:     &quot;Chemical aldehydes are best known as fragrances.&quot; [Shall I repeat that?] &quot;Chemical aldehydess are best known as fragrances.... Ethanol, or drinking alcohol, is also precessed to acetaldehyde. ...the body has an enzyme which breaks down the aldehydes to less toxic substances. This enzyme is aldehyde oxidase, or sometimes, aldehyde dehydrogenase. Aldehydes encountered dietarily or environmentally or produced in the body must be handled by aldehyde oxidase metabolic pathways.     Acetaldehyde is a paraticularly toxic substance which, in addition to being produced by threonine and ethanol, is a product of the metabolism (i.e. fermentation) of carbohydrate in yeast -- hence the Candida connection. Acetaldehyde is thought to be the major source of tissue damage in alcoholics rather than ethanol itself. The conversion of acetaldehyde into acetic acid&quot; for this reaction to occur, threonine to acetaldehyde to acetic acid to acetyl coenzyme A, NAD (niacine amide) is required, and aldehyde oxidase is dependent of riboflavin, iron, and molybdenum. These forgoing nutrients could be helpful to Candida albicans patients, and others who are sensitive to various fragrances and airborne odors. Those patients with aldehyde sensitivity are incredibly sensitive to any type of fragrance.     By coincidence, (or is it?) there\'s a little squibb in the newsletter from the Environmental Health Association of Dallas on fragrance. &quot;Perfume today is not made from flowers but from toxic chemicals..... More than 4,000 chemicals are used in fragrances. Of these, 95 percent are made from petroleum. Some toxic chemicals found in fragrances: toluene, ethanol, acetone, formaldehyde, limonene, benzene derivatives, methylene chloride, and many others known to cause cancer, birth defects, infertility, nervous system damage, or other injuries.... Exposure to scented products can cause exhaustion, weakness, \'hay fever\', dizziness, difficulty concentrating, headaches, rashes, swollen lymph glands, muscle aches and spasms, heart palpitations, nausea, stomach cramps, vomiting, asthma attacks, neuromotor dysfunction, seizures, and loss of consciousness.&quot; This was reprinted from No Perfume Means Healthier Air brochure, Breath of Fresh Air Battleaxe, Oakland, California.     And from another source comes another connection -- from Dr. Robert Atkins\' newsletter: Dr. Atkins is writing about Pantethine which he prescribes to his Crohn\'s Disease and Colitis patients, with acknowledgement to Dr. Melvin Werbach for Dr. Werbach\'s study that demonstrated that people with colitis have markedly decreased Coenzyme A activity if the mucosal surface of their colons, even when the blood levels of pantothenic acid are normal. Dr. Atkins concluded, based on his success with these patients of his, that Pantethine bypasses the block in converting Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid) to Coenzyme A. But also, that Pantethine is a growth factor for lactobacillus bulgaricus and bifidobacterium that we know help control yeast overgrowth (and Dr. Cooter also speaks of it in his book). Candida, according to antibody studies done at the Atkins Center, is involved in more than 80 percent of all cases of Crohn\'s and Colitis.     And for autoimmune problems, Dr. Atkins states, &quot; For all conditions that a doctor might prescribe prednisone -- allergies, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, lupus, and olther autoimmune diseases, pantethine can be safely, effectively substituted. I routinely use it for all of those conditions on hundreds of my patients, and it\'s valuable in weaning them off steroidal drugs, or certainly in allowing a lower dose....     By upping body levels of a body enzyme, pantethine counteracts brain fog, certain allergic sensitivities, and some consequences of alcoholism. (And here it is --) ... In people with candidiasis, the enzyme fights off a toxic byproduct called acetaldehyde, which is thought to cause brain fog, often-suffered but rarely diagnosed.... Acetaldehyde also is suspected of being responsible for some symptoms of alcoholism, including alcoholic heart muscle disease. The pantethine-stimulated enzyme also detoxifies formaldehyde, an all too frequent offender for chemically sensitive individuals.&quot;     In summary, Dr. Atkins is saying that Pantethine, without toxic consequences, can reduce cholesterol, counuteract oxidation, stimulate the growth of friendly bacteria, and fight allergies, inflammation, autoimmune disruptions, and alcoholism. In case you wondered, Dr. Cooter and Dr. Schmtt suggest 300 micrograms of Molybdenum in three divided doses per day, and further suggests staying on it for at least 4 months.. Dr. Atkins suggests 450 to 900 miligrams daily of Pantethine with an equal amount of Pantethenic Acid. </div>   WD</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://spectrumsleuth.10.forumer.com/index.php\">http://spectrumsleuth.10.forumer.com/index.php</a><!-- m --></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ http://spectrumsleuth.10.forumer.com/index.php</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi everyone,  Just wondering what people use to hide activated charcoal?  We typically use prunes, but it seems counterintuitive to give her fruit 2-4 times/day (as directed by DAN, since her dieoff is at that level right now) while fighting yeast!  I\'m also wondering how long die-off has lasted for people.  My daughter did a 3-week course of Nizoral followed by Nystatin for about 3 weeks now.  The Nizoral was a complete disaster.  The change to Nystatin is making her a little less difficult, but she\'s still having a pretty hard time most days.  We haven\'t seen any gains at all. Thanks for any input.  Jill</div>'

I threw away all of our CFGF stuff and showed her - and we started SCD.  The first few weeks were tough but once she started feeling better, her palate opened up quite a bit.  We are still on SCD but it is modified and includes rice and sweet potatoes, no dairy.  It works for us.  We are also doing food desensitization with Dr. Caprio - so we are clearing phenolic compounds - Malvin and Piperine (what makes fruit red/purple and nightshades).  Once we removed these items, she began sleeping more soundly.    My point is - your child will change - just make sure they are properly hydrated.

' <div class=\"postbody\">We had the IGG and IGE test done through immunolabs.  He did not have to fast before them.  It came back saying he was sensitive to wheat, barley, rye, walnuts, canola, eggs and pork.  He was allergic to wheat, eggs and walnuts.      We have eliminated everything from his diet and we have definitely seen improvement.  His bowel movements have improved DRAMATICALLY, and he used to walk around the room a lot when he was watching TV and bump into furniture with his body and swing his arms on banisters.  This has almost completely stopped.  When he has an infraction I can tell.  If I notice him acting different I\'ll ask him, \"did you eat something at school today that I didn\'t send you\" and most of the time he answers \"yes\".

' <div class=\"postbody\">I don\'t think alpha lipoic acid is an amino acid.  Is that what you were saying?  Perhaps I misread your post.  I always thought of alpha lipoic acid as an antioxidant and a potential chelator that can cross the blood brain barrier.    Sometimes people abbreviate alpha-linolenic acid as ALA.  Alpha linolenic acid <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">is different </span>from alpha lipoic acid.  Alpha-linolenic acid is an essentially fatty acid meaning it can\'t be manufactured by the human body.  When you consume alpha-linolenic acid your body converts it to EPA and DHA, two types of Omega-3 fatty acids.  I think alpha-linolenic acid is a good thing to use with l-carnitine since carnitine moves fatty acids into the cell mitochondria.   The only amino acid that I can think of that could be abbreviated ALA is Alanine but I don\'t think it has much to do with carnitine.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #800000\">There are many paths to autism.

I know fruits is really hard to think about not giving too much fruit but if you have yeast you need to be easy on the fruit.  That being said I am not saying don\'t let him eat fruit at all but you need to look to start something for the yeast.  Grapefruit Seed Extract, Olive Leaf Extract, Biotin which needs to be given with Magnesium, CytoFlora has been a wonder for us for removing yeast but it does not recolinate the good guys so you need Live Probiotics.

I gave him his first shot again on Tuesday, on Wednesday I was able to get him to imitate \"Mom\" go, key and teeth.  The words were much clearer.  He said Mom perfectly, even though he doesn\'t know what \"Mom\" is <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" />   He also was dry nearly all day, when his therapists have been changing his underpants 10 times over a 6 hour period, for weeks.

I had told her that I stopped the shots for a short while to see what would happen and to see if it would help the accidents, she told me it takes 18 months to 2 yearsa  to heal the methylation process (hope I stated that correctly) so it was important that we remain on them for that long at least.

I just keep coming back to the idea of going slow with any diet changes, to let the body adjust to whatever it is you\'re cutting out (that you might not even realize you\'re cutting out.)   My daughter has had huge gains on LOD. My plan was just to do it until she was healed enough to hold enough bacteria degrading oxalates in her gut, and then begin increasing oxalates again (to keep her from being too restricted, as we\'re also on GAPS and she also has huge fructose/fructan issues). She\'s got some medium oxalate foods now, and at the same time has been getting harder to transition (getting her to go from one room to the next requires lots of play/creativity/or counting down 123), harder time falling asleep, I think she\'s getting some yeast, too. I don\'t know if some of this is oxalate related. I hate to cut out the med oxalate veggies. =(</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Learning to jiggle when shaken.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Learning to jiggle when shaken.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I use levoxyl, which is like synthroid.  I have to take it a full 6 hours before any supplements at all or the levoxyl does not work.  This is kind of new news; my doctor did not know this.  They accused me of &quot;not really taking&quot; my levoxyl, and I asked at that time if supplements could interfere (other than the iron or calcium supplements listed on my bottle.)  He said no.  The next day, I was talking about this with my friend, and she told me that there was a new label on her bottle of synthroid that said you need to wait 4-6 hours before taking any supplements.  Once again, doctors are not always up on things.  I began waiting 6 hours (I take Reliv, a comprehensive liquid drink supplement) and my levoxyl kicked back in.  I\'m telling you this because my dad took synthroid for his thyroid for maybe a year, and it didn\'t do anything.  He takes lots of supplements.  They finally switched him to the Armour stuff and it\'s working well.  So I\'m thinking maybe supplements don\'t interfere with the Armour like the synthroid, which would be a big deal for most of us here, especially when trying to separate things for our kids.

If you are around long enough, you can see the thinking change (or if you follow the DAN reports over a decade!). First the big causative ingredient was the large amounts of thimerosal in vaccines, then they took out thimerosal and the autism rates were supposed to drop. Instead they rose. So then parents started looking at other toxins, viruses, etc. Five years from now, it may be something new.</div>  And some people (not saying you) will see this and think there must not be any truth in any of it. Other people will see this and think there must be at least some truth in all of it. I think the nature of autism is evolving so it makes sense that the triggers causing these symptoms are changing. There are so many people with kids on this board who don\'t fit the definition of classical autism. There are a lot of girls, too.   I think it\'s exciting to be a part of a forum where there is so much being discussed because I think as we keep talking we see where the Venn diagrams overlap. People have their different views and information, but when intelligent people disagree there is usually truth on both sides and the key is to find that place where the different truths intersect, because I think then you\'re really onto something.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Learning to jiggle when shaken.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Learning to jiggle when shaken.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">My understanding is with COMT he should be on hydroxy B12. the C677tMTHFr mutation can cause elevated homocysteine levels. Folinic acid should help with that. I would get professional advice on this or maybe Rick can correct me if I am wrong. If it were my child, I would have homocysteine levels checked and megaloblastic anemia before starting on the supplements. Even if the DAN tells you to go ahead and start those, I would still have the blood drawn and then start. I like to know where we are beginning so that we know, as best we can, what gets us to future destinations.   While you are checking levels, check D levels. It just seems crazy how low D levels can be. Normal range is 32-100 and some are suggesting that the level is going up higher soon. Others also agree that 32 is an artificially low number. One of my daughters has been on 5,000IUs/day for 6 months with her level only being at 50. At the DAN conference, it was suggested that the range for our kids be 120-150. I feel much, much better on pretty high levels of D. My level was 19.5 and went up to 33 after 50,000IUs/day for 10 days. I started feeling so much better. I am still working on getting it up to 100. My husband\'s was low. I just think you can\'t get anything to work right when the D levels are too low. Low D seems to be an issue with COMT mutations. I believe it is with MTHFr as well. Not to mention that kids are indoors more and when outdoors are covered in sun shirts, sunblock, and hats.  Also with COMT, I would add fish oil and CoQ10. It has worked very well with us. Soy should be avoided with a COMT mutation due to its 2, 4 dihydroxy estrogens which require COMT to metabolize. Look up both mutations. Also look them up as under and over methylators. Unfortunately there aren\'t a lot of dots connected out there.  It seems our kids may need higher than average doses on many things. It may be due to gut, liver, kidney, enzyme issues or any number of metabolic issues. An MV may still be in order, as well as good calcium supplementation.</div>'

My thinking was that if vit A &amp; D came together in CLO, the way God put the vitamins in the fish then it was good enough for us. lol  I know for a fact that the vit A is not interfering with his D absorption as we only started giving D3 less than a year ago and his levels have gone from 28 to around 75 since we started.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi guys,  I was thinking this morning about some people on another list who couldn\'t afford/find DAN doctors, and saw a nutritionist instead.  I was thinking this might be an option for some of you who need a lower-priced option.    The nutritionists they were seeing were able to order up lab tests.  They were also much more open-minded about the DAN interventions, and many already knew a bit about them.  And, as so much of this revolves around nutrition and supplements, they know the territory.    I really don\'t remember specifics, but I think that the nutritionists charged about $120 or so for (a very extensive and comprehensive) first visit, and then a pretty minimal amount for follow-up (much done over the phone).  They took A LOT of time with the patients, too.

' <div class=\"postbody\">We\'ve used both the Kirkman enzymes and the Houston\'s.  For our family, the Houston\'s are definitely the way to go.  My kids don\'t swallow pills and because we don\'t do any flavorings, the chewables are out.  We used Kirkman\'s hypoallergenic capsules on and off for years but it was difficult to get them in my kids because the powder does not dissolve very well in liquid.  Once they saw something in their drink, they wouldn\'t drink it.  Thus, I don\'t think they ever got enough of the Kirkman\'s.    We\'ve been using Houston\'s religiously for the past 4 weeks and they are working out wonderful.  We are GFCFSF and mostly CF, however, today i gave my son an organic blue corn chip WITH no phenol.

I listened to a bio-chat of Boyd Haley\'s recently and am not sure what to think.  I do think though with so many good reports on the stuff that there must be SOMETHING to it.  Maryann</div>   Here is Dr Ray\'s response to Dr Haley\'s comments on BioChat.....  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">\"For years Dr. Haley has said that he doesnâ€™t think chlorella could be of use in metal detox. I first approached him on the recommendation of a mutual friend who is publicly involved in the natural approach to chelation. through him I learned that Dr. Haley thought NDF was just chlorella. And, I would have to agree with him, that I had seen little to no evidence that OTC chlorella had any major impact on metal detox.   At the Autism One conference in Chicago two years ago I met and spoke with Dr. Haley and told him that NDF contained â€˜cell wall decimated chlorella, cell wall lysed probiotics and cilantroâ€™ and that it was not â€˜justâ€™ chlorella. I explained how we and several other doctors had done pre and post NDF, DMPS and NDF, DMSA and NDF, EDTA and NDF provocative challenges with Doctors Data and other labs, and showed that NDF increased the metal yield in the urine by itself and in all combinations. I also explained that I had shown with Atomic Absorption Spectrometry that by weight, NDF absorbed 50 times more methyl mercury than OTC chlorella in the oral cavities of folks with amalgam fillings. That paper, published in Townsend, and the labs I refer to, can be seen at <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.healthydetox.org\">www.healthydetox.org</a><!-- w -->. (If he had time to look at all of this, which I have to doubt, he would indeed have the â€˜raw dataâ€™ he wants.)  He seemed to find my story very interesting. I suggested (begged is probably closer) he do a study, specifically to find out why it helped so many people with neurological and brain problems, as we were seeing results in those and other arenas that could not be explained by placebo effect. He thought that was a good idea, but that the University of Kentucky would require a donation to process the project. I thought he was going to say something like $50,000, judging by his dire expression. But he had a good sense of humor, and gleamed when he told me 300 bucks should do it. So I gave him a few bottles of NDF and NDF Plus, emailed him all the labs I had so far, thanked him for taking the time to look at something somewhat out of his field (ie. a natural product), and promptly wrote the check for $300. I must say I was excited.   Well, itâ€™s two years later and I havenâ€™t heard a word. The check to the University was never cashed. It appears he still thinks NDF and NDF Plus are just chlorella. As to his last comments: NDF is tested by AmTest labs for metals content batch by batch and does not contain mercury! We do not claim that fulvic acid is a chelator, we do notice that it a catalyst, and thereby facilitates the detox process. And, yes, again yes, I would love to see someone â€˜like himâ€™ test NDF and NDF Plus.   People are getting better, safely, with NDF and NDF Plus in many cases where they could not before. As a clinician of 25 years, as long as the word â€˜safeâ€™ is included with the â€˜improvementâ€™, and the remedy comes from nature in its whole, raw, and unpolluted form, and generally recognized as a food or well documented healing herb, I am willing to find out the exact chemical reason why a little (or maybe a lot) later; at which point I will still be suspicious that modern chemistry with all of its complexities and knowledge will still not be able to fully comprehend or reproduce the mysteries of Mother Nature.\"</div></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Tami</span>      <span class=\"gensmall\">Last edited by <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5&amp;sid=2440c6a4acfecfc5f8284228e9c60db1\">TamiW</a> on Thu Dec 29, 2005 1:09 pm, edited 1 time in total.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Tami</div>'

Where did you see to take them out?  Zucchini is high salicylate, but they say yellow is ok; they are so similar that I\'m not sure why one is ok and the other is not.  I know that peeling zucchini will help a LOT with salicylate content; peel thick as the salicylates are under the skin.  This is true with apples too.  Golden delicious apples are the best and usually are tolerated by our kids.    After an oxalate dump, we always see a really good jump.  Genital pain is a sign of oxalates too.

I just do not have time to play games and as my son has been giving so many meds at an extreamly early age under the most extreame circumstances he was a professional medcine spitter.

The FDA, in accordance with the wishes of the large pharmaceutical companies who supply the feedstocks for 90% of all dietary supplements, allows vitamin companies to label their products as \"natural,\" \"food-based,\" or even \"organic,\" even if these supplements are composed of 90% synthetic ingredients, including genetically modified organisms. The Organic Consumers Association (OCA), along with the Naturally Occuring Standards Group, is launching a new \"truth in labeling\" campaign that will enable consumers to distinguish between those vitamins and supplements that are truly natural or organic, and those that simply claim to be. You can read more about the Naturally Occurring StandardIn a nutshell, the new Naturally Occurring Standard (NOS) will allow consumers to know whether a vitamin/supplement product:        * Contains synthetic ingredients.      * Contains genetically engineered ingredients.      * Only contains ingredients found in nature.      * Only contains ingredients that are sustainably harvested and fairly-traded.      * Is organic.

And stay tuned to the Nutri-Con section of the OCA website for further developments.         HOW \"NATURAL\" OR \"ORGANIC\" ARE YOUR VITAMINS &amp; SUPPLEMENTS?  OCA is building an expansive database of companies that meet strict NOS standards for being 100% naturally occurring and organic. To find out if your favorite vitamin/supplement is truly natural, please submit that company\'s name when you sign the Nutri-Con petition (see above).

This is a page from the website: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.enzymestuff.com/conditionsensitivities.htm#1\">http://www.enzymestuff.com/conditionsensitivities.htm#1</a><!-- m -->  I don\'t have the book anymore, but I believe she said the enzymes work for IgG sensitivities versus true allergies. She talks about migraines, which is what she had, and was helped by enzymes. For me, eczema was related to bacterial overgrowth. Natural antibacterials worked for me. I know there are multiple causes. Detergents made mine worse also.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">thanks MJ, Anyone else? I was wondering if a kid, like mine, who is allergic to aspergillus mold, would benefit from avoiding yeast in food. I think fermented foods are great and my son\'s allergies have improved, but I don\'t want to leave any stone unturned here.  It would be pretty much the opposite of what we\'ve been doing. I read feast without yeast, but I can\'t really make sense of it. I feel it doesn\'t give enough information on the science behind it. I\'m gathering that it\'s yeast by-products that were causing trouble for their kid (in FWY). I don\'t get how foods containing antagonistic yeast would feed candida either, but that\'s not really my question.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi! Well, we did it wrong at first. We ordered nut flours and started baking stuff. WRONG! Make sure you go to PecanBread.com and read how to begin the diet in stages. We jumped in all at once but it worked for us. I don\'t know if that would be good advice for everyone. When my son asked for his usual foods, I just said we don\'t have any. I then offered, soup, chicken, eggs, bananas, pancakes or applesauce. Suprisingly, my very non-compliant son had no problem with it. He wouldn\'t eat the soup although my daughter LOVES it! He liked the scrambled eggs and banana pancakes. (puree a ripe banana and mix in 1 egg, cook like a pancake.) The die-off was challenging. Have some activated charcoal ready and just know it is working when you get a die-off! My son is a constipated one and this and cramping will happen in the beginning. My son signed hurt and said tummy. I was cramping too so I understood. Pecanbread has info on what to do if they are constipated on their website. However, in 1 week we have seen so many benefits that once you get past the initial die-pff it is worth it. Just make sure you understand the diet, follow the guidelines and make a commitment for at least a year. You will need to make sure your supplements are SCD legal also. There is a PecanBread yahoo group too that is great for questions. Good luck and keep us posted on how you do.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Tami, how do you feel about the myclesized Vit A drops? the ones i have are palmitate and Megson mentions against this. Is there still any belief about the G-recptor being linked to Vit. A malaborption? The pertussis part came up on his asyra (although not a blood test which would be more accurate). So I\'ve been afraid to do the Vit. A protocol. Also, he woke up last night in a cold sweat, had trouble falling back to sleep and was grinding teeth. Has been moody as well. Have you heard of Candidase also working on the viruses too? got my Enhansa today, I pray he\'s not allergic to it! I can usually tell if he starts hiccuping right away. He did this with celery juice something I\'ve tried to give him for brain inflammation. This stuff sounds great because it works on so many levels. I\'m most interested in it glutathione and yeast abilities. Viruses too I suppose. Yes he did have his vision checked and it was fine , That was one of the first things we did when he started all this. Interesting thing is, he looks right into your eyes and seems to look at things directly except when he gets what I feel looks \"out of it\" with dilated eyes. this is when he does the visuals. He does seem to do it more with certain yeast treatments more than others. I was also behind on my B12 shots (still want to find a better option to these) I can\'t say if this is what improved things before or not. I don\'t like how some people have to start giving these everyday to see the same effect. Seems more like a brain stimmulant than providing a necessary nutrient. So, I\'m precautious about this. Not to mention it is burning now when I give it. This could be helping with histamines I guess. Are there any other options for this? I may try kirmkans powder. A little is better than none. , I\'ve also bounced around diabetes to many docs. this would also explain his big problems with yeast, or it could be the yeast causing diabetic symptoms! The visuals can also be a result of yeas dying off too rapidly causing sharp blood sugar dips and then visual disturbances. hmmm. Anyway, thanks for your help and listening1      Jen</div>'

It\'s very easy to train a bunny to go in a litter box lined with litter meant for bunnies.  However, they get scared easily.  They are prey animals so they\'re constantly on the alert for dangers.  They can break their spine if they fall down.  Their GI system is delicate and they can die from GI issues.  All in all I would say that bunnies are not the best pets for young children.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I honestly think our kids could use IV vitamins in the beginning of treatment. This would help so much with kids that just look so malnourished to get treated as if in the hospital with severe malabsorption problems. Just once a week would be so helpful. They need anything to catch them up so they can heal. Here we are, rubbing on creams and forcing stuff down their throats that they can\'t even tolerate, much less digest and use. This is the problem because they are so overburdened with immune system dysfunction, yeasts, bacteria....you name it. How in the world can they get on top of it all? We pay so much to go to these private doctors and I really wish they would get more aggressive with getting things in order from the start. First visit, get vitamins and minerals in them, x-rays of the abdomen to check for blockages or abnormalities, blood tests, urine tests. Hair analysis. Honestly it should be a long visit. Half-way going at this is not working!!!! They need to be checked into a hospital and cared for.   If they need continuous IV chelation and nutrition in a hospital setting, then give it to them!!! Get it under control, acidosis, systemic yeast, malnourishment, metal contamination. I\'m sick of the long drawn out process to get our kids on track. I don\'t think that it is necessary quite frankly. I think a lot can be done with intensive treatment to recover them much quicker. They need infusions of magnesium to treat blood acidosis, get oxygen into the cells, stop the freaking brain damage! A child with lead poisoning is lucky, they actually get treated! Sorry to rant, but I\'m seriously sick of us moms having to go on forums and figure this stuff out on our own, not to mention the thousands of dollars we\'re paying to doctors and specialists who are still not treating this as an emergency. Even dialysis would help our kids in the beginning. Just look at their blood under a microscope, seriously. What is going on here? Our kids are very SICK! You can look at them and tell. If this was a 10 year old, they\'d be admitted into a hospital with confusion and all kinds of tests would be done. They\'d find brain swelling, infection, poisoning. But since autism is the diagnosis du jour, they ignore the other things that can be going on. Yes, it\'s overdiagnosed...by morons who call themselves doctors who know absolutely nothing about malnutrition, rickets, allergies. Nothing. All they know is what drug treats what. I know more about what specific vitamins do than my doctor does. clueless. that is just sickening.  We need a &quot;House&quot; doctor.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Training is very simple.  I was very anxious about it but now my worries were laughable.    Dr. N. requires training if you rent one.  They take care in making sure that you understand it and most importantly how fast to take it up and down in pressure.  I\'m sure it\'s a liability thing too.  You can hurt yourself if you take it up or bring it down too fast.  It\'s just literally turning the pressure release valve in incremented time intervals.    We did the training in two visits, two dives each visit with like two hours in between dives.  The first time Rick explained everything to us and took us up and down from outside the chamber.  My wife and I took turns.  The second time we operated it ourselves from inside the chamber.  It\'s just a matter of turning that same pressure knob from inside.  After a few dives and seeing how you feel, mostly by the ear pressure, you get a quick feel for it and don\'t even need to time it.  It is extremely easy.    I was sceptical whether mHBOT really worked.  I can say that my son had an amazing response to it.  We did about 80 hours in those 30 days which is a lot but I wanted a clear indication.  It was an obvious, very positive result.    After about two weeks, we haven\'t dove since January 3rd, we started seeing a degredation in the positives that we wittnessed.  It confirmed for me that mHBOT did have positive effects, undoubtably!!    We received the concentrator yesterday and are still awaiting for the chamber to arrive.  I am anxious to start back up and get back on track.    In hind sight, if I wasn\'t so sceptical, I would have just purchased outright and if it didn\'t do anything, sell it to someone else for $3K less than the purchase price.  I wasn\'t sure legally if I would have any liability for reselling medical equipment, so I didn\'t even go there.    I also purchased it through Rick.  He put together the package (chamber and concentrator) and it ships directly to your home.  Total package runs about $20K for the Vitaeris 320.    You can buy directly from Oxyhealth with a Dr.\'s prescription, but then you also have to get the concentrator on your own.  The direct retail price was higher because they give Rick a discount since he does the training.  It just about washes.  Plus then you get full support from Rick if you have any problems or questions.    Also you can purchase from Performance Hyperbarics, but there have been some people that were not that happy with that chamber from what I understand.  They have since made some changes though to the chamber.  There was a post about it a few days back.  It is about $4K cheaper though.  Rick can arrange that sell as well.    Hope this helps.

' <div class=\"postbody\">This is simply my personal opinion.  If you are working with a Homeopath I would give them all info and run anything you decide to add.  I am using a Homeopath and I had a really interesting reaction to my second dose.  Even though it is a great remedy for me.  If used to frequently it actually starts proving.  IE causing the symptoms it is being used to treat.  So I suffer from cold hands and feet.  They were cold as ice today.  So now I will be dosing only weekly rather then every 3 days.  The first 3 days was like being in heaven but when used to soon it cause\'s trouble.  My point here would be that if you are treating something that your rememdy already treats you could make the problem worse by treating it too much.  I am using Pleos for my son for Strep and having some good results.  We talk to the Homeopath in 2 weeks to do my son\'s remedy.  I will most certainly ask him if he wants me to stop or keep using the Pleos and will follow his advice that is what I am paying for.</div>'

We are doing the Cutler protocol, just like Kenny, and dose the ALA every 3 hours. He has not been harmed at all, in fact is is agreeing with him. Also, the yellowish skin color he used to have on his hands and feet is almost completely gone, nice white and pink! Pink! I haven\'t seen that in several YEARS! The Cutler protocol is working for our son, but yes we are also cautious with ALA, very cautious.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Summer,    Others may have different thoughts on how to start.  Any way that is easiest for you.  I think for the most of us, it is just starting very low and working your way up.  It all depends on how your child will react.  Mine had die-off for a few days (hyper, horrible poops and just \"off\").  So I still gave it time before increasing so he had some \"good\" days without feeling miserable.  Some kids had die-off that lasted two weeks and then got better.   Some move up very quickly.  So just watch for die-off and proceed from there.  For my son, everytime we increased we had die-off again.      I guess for me I started with 75mg only once a day so I could almost see how his behavior would be at certain times of the day - b/c it allowed me 24 hours until the next dose.  So if I started it at night - let most of the die-off occur during the night then the day wasn\'t as bad - or if you give it in the am, is the behavior horrible for the earlier part of the day and subsides later.  Sorry this is confusing, but I hope you get my thought on it.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Kristen &amp; Matt     Samantha 7  McKinley 6 Dyspraxia, ADD/ADHD, recovered ASD  Riley 2    Cadighan 1</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Kristen  Matt     Samantha 7  McKinley 6 Dyspraxia, ADD/ADHD, recovered ASD  Riley 2    Cadighan 1</div>'

We go back this Thursday and Friday for 4 more treatments. I really like Dr. Cheryl, sometimes I feel a little rushed and I feel bad for all my questions but I am paying a lot of money so I feel like I am entitled to ask. We see Dr. Demio in a few weeks and I think they both bring wonderful things to the table. It is confusing because they do not agree on everything and Dr. Cheryl is more conservative with treatments.  I have not done HBOT but I imagine next visit, he will bring it up. It\'s not really in the budget and I\'ve got too many things on my list (mainly chelating agents like NCDâ€¦. and I have not even touched the viral issue yet) so HBOT is on my list.. but at a distance right now until I have more time to research and learn about it.

Probiotics, by killing off the yeast, can cause major oxalate dumping.  That happens with us consistently.  Is your doctor consulting with Great Plains?  I think they have great knowledge about the oxalates.  After doing this for three (?) years now, I think that the yeast and mold issues are just as important in oxalate control as diet.  And realistically, especially on a long-term basis, you can only do so much with diet.      Did you doctor want to retest?  It sounds to me, based on what I\'ve read consistently on the LOD board, that you could indeed be in the middle of an oxalate dump right now, and would test sky-high if you were.  Especially if they have not tested so high in the past, and you haven\'t changed diet much, I would suspect the dump first before I began to suspect other things.      The Trienza could indeed cause oxalate issues, but we do not use enzymes, so I have no personal experience with this.  Have read that people have had success HELPING with oxalates with the enzymes though.  BUT--they are made from fungus--aspergillus culture, I think--you might have problems with the Trienza.  Mold makes oxalates.  Have you used other enzymes?  If you have used others without issues, I would think the Trienza either isn\'t the problem or that you\'re seeing a \"positive\" negative response from the Trienza.    The dumps are scary.  They still are for me, even after years of dealing with them.  My son regresses into behavior I haven\'t seen in YEARS, and for us it can last up to two weeks.  I am sick to my stomach through the whole thing.    But then the rainbow comes out, and I see the best kid I ever have.  And it lasts.  So it is worth it.      The theory is that there may be metals bound up in the oxalates, and when released, you get \"metals\" behavior while they\'re on their way OUT of the body (yay!!!)  I think that makes sense with my son.    I might pull the Trienza, but I think the down cycle has every earmark of being an oxalate dump--especially the penis pain.  But I don\'t believe in forcing major healing crises, either.  If he\'s that miserable, it\'s happening too fast.  I would at least cut back.  I would evaluate the foods, and especially any new ones for oxalate content, but I would suspect the Trienza is doing the damage here (just my opinion.)      Enzymes can be powerful things, and almost everything I have heard/read is good.  Changing the ecology of the gut can be rough on a little guy though.  Keep us posted!!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

He started to regress after his 12 month shots when he received MMR, DPT, Hep B, Varicella, at the same time.  He always had reactions to vaccines (high fevers for 2 weeks off and on, severe swelling at the injection site, unexplained rashes)  but I was told that was all normal.  We have the same problem in both my side and my husband\'s side of autoimmune disorders and we have been tracing it back through medical records as reactions to vaccines.  When I was 14 after i got the Hepatitis B shot (they thought my sister had it) I developed hyperthyroidism a month later.   My husband has type I diabetes, celiac disease, and Sjogren syndrome and childhood asthma.    Since we have started biomed one year ago he has made tremendous improvements.  He has very low muscle tone and he now can drink out of a straw.  This was quite a moment for me:)  He does not speak, but i am confident that he will.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Mimi, this is very interesting and I appreciate the time you are taking to look this up.  Something I wanted to briefly mention (although I\'m sure many of you already know this). There seems to be a large number of children with autism with a Vit D deficiency. I understand the controversy about using different labs to test and others\' perception of the results, however, I know of several children with autism who were tested by their pediatrician and discovered Vit D deficiency.   After several years of horrible behaviors from my daughter during Jan - March/Apr, we finally had her tested this year and discovered she was deficient. Previously, my daughter would have seizure-type episodes during these months. Our medical doctors believe she has seizures, but her testing (extensive) has revealed no seizures. (Briefly - absence seizures where she doesn\'t respond, goes flat and will not elicit reflex response by blinking when someone flashes their fingers towards her eyes. More seriously, episodes where she seems to fall and either catches herself or her para/teacher catches her, followed by erratic sensory disturbances - sniffing the floor, licking walls, eyes rolling back in her head - lose of bladder and falling asleep soon after). These episodes ONLY occur during these months. We started out with a diagnosis of Vit D deficiency in January and she had three absence seizures within two weeks of that. However, she hasn\'t had any since then and no larger seizure-type activity.   Obviously, this is only my observation and not \'proof\' at all. But, I believe that Vit D deficiency is very common in children with autism. I also believe that Vit D deficiency can cause an increase in seizures (which is also something seen commonly in children with autism).   It is my personal belief that Vit D supplements kept my daughter a bit healthier this winter.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ &quot;... but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.&quot;</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ ... but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</div>'

VITAMIN K DEFICIENCY AS A CAUSE OF AUTISTIC SYMPTOMS                                                                   Catherine Tamaro, B.S.M.E.                                                               Mercer Island, Washington        Vitamin K overview    Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin important in blood coagulation and bone metabolism. One of its   functions is to keep calcium in the bones and out of soft tissues, blood vessels, and the nervous   system. Vitamin K1, the predominant circulating form, is found in green leafy vegetables, some   dietary oils including olive, hemp, canola, soybean &amp; cottonseed oils, liver, and fish meal. Vitamin   K2 can be found in chicken egg yolk, butter, cow liver, certain cheeses, and fermented soybean   products such as natto, and it is also produced by intestinal bacteria. Vitamin K3 is a synthetic form.  1 Many of the recent studies on Vitamin K have found that the K2 form is the most effective in   calcium and bone health.2        Vitamin K has a number of interesting functions, many of which relate specifically to autism:    â€¢ Vitamin K regulates calcium in the body through osteocalcin and the matrix G1A protein.3 Both   bone proteins are active only after undergoing carboxylation, a process in which Vitamin K is a   required cofactor. Carboxylated bone proteins have a strong affinity for calcium and control its   movement, directing it to the bones and teeth and preventing its deposition in soft tissues.    Calcium management appears to be dysregulated in people with the E4 form of Apolipoprotein.  4,5,6 Osteocalcin is found in the brain; in its absence, it appears that brain cells become more   vulnerable to the effects of calcium.    Vitamin K deficiency appears to play a role in the development of osteoporosis and in the   deposition of calcium into blood vessels.7,8 Calcification of the arteries, known as   â€œarteriosclerosis,â€ contributes to heart attacks and strokes.    â€¢ Vitamin K, an anti-oxidant that is more powerful than Vitamin E or CoQ10, is able to potently inhibit   glutathione depletion-mediated oxidative cell death.9,10    â€¢ Vitamin K inhibits production of Interleukin-6, an inflammatory cytokine.11    â€¢ Vitamin K is found in high concentration in the pancreas and appears to be involved in controlling   blood sugar.12    â€¢ Vitamin K is involved in the development of the nervous system.13    â€¢ Vitamin K has a role in glutamate conversion14 and its absence affects the rate of activity of the   enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase15.    In this paper I am proposing that a deficiency in Vitamin K causes unregulated calcium movement   and deposition in the body of the autistic child, and that unregulated calcium is a cause of many of   the symptoms associated with autism. I am also proposing that a Vitamin K deficiency is the cause   of the calcium oxalate crystals found in many autistic children.    Calcium, in tandem with the neurotransmitter glutamate, is essential to the functioning of the   excitatory cells of the nervous system: once glutamate opens the neuronal cellâ€™s calcium channel,   calcium pours into the channel and triggers the neuron to fire. The concentration of glutamate   within the nervous system is therefore carefully regulated by the nervous system (specifically the   astrocytes, which can be negatively affected by mercury and by neurotoxins produced by Lyme   spirochetes) because excess glutamate will keep the calcium channels open, allowing calcium to   continue to enter, and excite, the neurons. Dr. Russell Blaylock, among others, has written   extensively about the neurotoxicity associated with an excess of glutamate.16 However, I believe   that unregulated calcium may play an unappreciated role in triggering the incessant neuronal firing   and resultant cell death that are a hallmark of excess glutamate in the nervous system. If a child is   unable to regulate calcium due to a Vitamin K deficiency, that child may display signs of glutamate   toxicity and uncontrolled neuronal firing that manifest as the cluster of behavioral disorders called   autism.    Russell Blaylock, M.D., characterizes glutamate as    â€œone of the most common neurotransmitters in the brain. Its role is primarily that of  an  excitatory substance, that is it causes the brain to be stimulated, much the way cocaine does.   Using biochemical mapping techniques, we now know that many areas of the brain (such as the   cortex, striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, cerebellum, and the visual and auditory   system) all contain an extensive network of glutamate type neurons. This means that glutamate is   involved in a wide variety of brain functions. It has also been demonstrated that activation of cortical   glutamate neurons can in turn activate other neurons within the nuclei located deep within the   brain, even those not using glutamate as a neurotransmitterâ€¦    â€œAfter studying a number of brains specifically stained for these special receptors, scientists   determined that the glutamate receptor is located on the cell body of the neuron and its dendrite â€“   on the fibers emanating from the neuron cell body like the branches of a tree. Being excitatory   transmitters, glutamate and aspartate both are involved in activating a number of brain systems   concerned with sensory perception, memory, orientation in time and space, cognition, and motor   skills.â€a      a Russell L. Blaylock, M.D., Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills, (Santa Fe, NM), 1997, pp. 31-32    Dr. Blaylock explains that glutamate causes neurons to fire by opening their calcium channels. He   explains the process this way:    â€œIt has been known for some time that many cells, especially neurons, contain special pores or   channels that regulate the entry of calcium into the cell. These special pores are named calcium   channels. These channels plan an important role in the normal functioning of the neurons. In fact, it   is thought that the calcium channels play a vital role in activation of neurons and transmission of   their impulses. When a neurotransmitter (the chemical messenger or key) comes into contact with   the receptor (the lock) on the neuron fiberâ€™s membrane, the calcium channel opens and the in-  flowing calcium triggers the neuron to fire or be activated.    â€œNormally this opening and closing of the calcium channel is carefully regulated. When stimulated   this channel opens for only a fraction of a second, allowing minute amounts of calcium to enter the   neuron. Like glutamate concentrations outside the cell, calcium concentrations inside the cell are   carefully controlled by special protective mechanisms. Should too much calcium enter the cell,   special calcium pumps drive the excess back out of the neuron. Some of the calcium is also   captured and stored within the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell, a long wavy structure within the   cytoplasm.    â€œIt appears that several of the excitotoxins, including glutamate and aspartate, work by opening the   calcium channels, at least on certain subtypes of receptors. When these neurotransmitters are   allowed to come into contact with the receptor in too high a concentration or for too long a period of   time, the calcium channel gets stuck in the open position, allowing calcium to pour into the cell in   large amounts.    â€œWhen this happens the protective mechanisms are triggered. But, as with the glutamate pumps,   the calcium pumps also require large amounts of energy as ATP. This energy must be supplied   continuously, especially if the calcium continues to enter in large amounts and for a prolonged   period of time.â€b    Dr. Blaylockâ€™s book concerns the toxicity of glutamate, and he warns readers of the hazards of   ingesting dietary glutamate. He describes the role of the calcium channels but does not address   the questions of how much calcium is or should be present in the extracellular fluid, how it got   there, how it is removed, or whether its presence is or should be controlled. He does, however,   implicate calcium deposits in the brain in the etiology of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.    Given its potential toxicity to the nervous system if uncontrolled, it appears that one of the important   functions of Vitamin K is to regulate the availability and concentration of calcium throughout the   nervous system. Calcium that is regulated is essential to life. Calcium that is unregulated is   hazardous to neuronal and organ functioning. If    b Ibid, pp. 42-43    uncontrolled it will leave its proper storage places, which are the bones and teeth, because it has   not been firmly cemented into place, and instead it will be deposited in the soft tissues and blood   vessels of the body. If it enters the nervous system unaccompanied by its carboxylated â€œescortâ€   proteins, it seems possible that it could enter the calcium channels in excessive amounts and   trigger uncontrolled neuronal firing. I believe that once the autistic childâ€™s body has an adequate   intake of Vitamin K it will be able to carboxylate the bone proteins, which will then be able to control   calcium and keep excess amounts out of the nervous system. This should lead to an amelioration   of the childâ€™s neurological symptoms.    Recent research into the etiology of autism has targeted mutations or polymorphisms of the genes   controlling the glutamate receptors and the calcium channels as areas of interest. Studies looking   at mutations of the glutamate receptor genes have produced mixed results.17,18,19 However, a   paper published in September 2006 examined 116 autistic subjects and found a problem in a   gene regulating the calcium channels.20 It seems possible that a mutation in a calcium channel-  controlling gene, coupled with a Vitamin K deficiency and resultant lack of carboxylated proteins,   could lead to uncontrolled neuronal firing that presents as neurological or â€œpsychiatricâ€ symptoms.c   It is also possible that mutations, deletions or substitutions exist in the gene(s) encoding the   enzymes that require Vitamin K as a cofactor, making those enzymes less efficient and thereby   increasing the need for Vitamin K.    Vitamin K and Oxalic Acid Production    Calcium dysregulation appears to play an important role in the development of calcium oxalate   deposits in humans, a topic whose relationship to autism is currently being explored by autism   researchers. Oxalic acid is an organic dicarboxylic acid produced by plants, sometimes in   abundance, in order to manage and store calcium. Oxalic acid can be produced endogenously by   humans in situations of deficiency of certain vitamins and it can be produced by various species of   fungi including Aspergillus niger. Oxalic acid is highly corrosive, with a pH of approximately 1.4-1.6.   Much but not all of the oxalic acid in plants is bound to calcium, thereby making it insoluble. When   oxalate-containing plants are eaten by humans, the soluble and insoluble oxalates are normally   degraded in the GI tract by the anaerobic bacterium Oxalobactor formigenes, which is easily   destroyed by antibioticsd. Insoluble oxalates that are not degraded in the GI tract tend to pass out in   the stool. The soluble oxalate can also bind to calcium consumed in food, thereby becoming   insoluble. However, if the soluble oxalate is not either degraded by bacteria or bound to calcium   consumed in food, then it can be absorbed through the intestinal membrane. Soluble oxalate,   whether absorbed by the digestive tract, produced by the human liver, or produced by infectious   fungi, will either bind to calcium and other      c It is worth remembering that most vaccines contain glutamate in various forms. Infants have not developed the   enzyme system necessary to handle exogenous loads of glutamate, so the regular injection of glutamate from the   many infant vaccines could either initiate or accelerate the process of neuronal hyperexcitation.  d The vaccine preservative thimerosal, if excreted through the babyâ€™s biliary system into the stool, would also have   acted as an antibiotic on gastrointestinal flora.    minerals and become insoluble or will be carried into cells on the same transporters that carry   sulfate, bicarbonate, and chloride. (Oxalic acid binds to cations, including calcium, zinc, sodium,   potassium, and magnesium.)    Calcium oxalate (CaOx) salts are insoluble and are found in many different locations in the body,   including areas that have already sustained injury, causing or increasing inflammation. CaOx salts   can be found in organs, soft tissues, blood vessels, and joints. They will upregulate inflammation,   they will cause mechanical damage, and they will interfere with the electrical signaling that is the   means by which the nervous system communicates with the body.    Kidney stones, for example, are often composed of CaOx, and they cause both inflammatory and   mechanical damage to the kidney tubules. Vitamin K deficiency appears to be a factor in the   formation of kidney stones,21 and Vitamin K-dependent carboxylase enzymes are found in the   kidney tubules.22    The Low Oxalate Diet (LOD) was developed by the Vulvar Pain Foundation (VPF) to ameliorate the   vulvar pain that was found by Dr. Clive Solomons to be linked to the presence of oxalates. Dr.   Solomons discovered the role of oxalates in triggering pain, and the assumption was made that the   major source of oxalates was dietary. Over time the VPF developed a diet low in oxalates that was   designed to lower dietary oxalate intake, with the goal of reducing body stores of oxalates and   therefore reducing pain. The VPFâ€™s diet has recently been presented as a solution to some of the   behavioral and health problems plaguing children with autism.    The LOD as presented by the VPF and the listserve Trying_Low_Oxalates (TLO) does not   contemplate or advise the use of Vitamin K. Since the purpose of LOD is to lower dietary oxalates, it   discourages the consumption of leafy greens which are high in oxalates but which are a main food   source of Vitamin K1. LOD does encourage the use of citrate minerals, namely calcium citrate and   magnesium citrate, because citrate seems to be able to chelate calcium from the CaOx salts in the   body.    The Low Oxalate Diet developers do not appear to have examined the question of what happens to   the calcium freed from the calcium oxalate salts. However, at least in the case of autistic children, it   is probable that they have low levels of Vitamin K and therefore low levels of carboxylated bone   proteins. Thus the children presumably have little ability to manage this freed calcium, which will   circulate unimpeded into the nervous system and other organs and tissues. This influx of   unmanaged calcium into circulation and then into the nervous system is, I believe, the reason that   so many autistic children are exhibiting adverse responses to the LOD, including seizures,   behavioral regression, hyperactivity, and depression. These symptoms do not indicate that oxalates   have moved from storage into circulation for transport to the disposal sites (termed â€œoxalate   dumpingâ€ on the TLO listserve), but rather reflect the deleterious effects of an influx of unmanaged   calcium into the nervous system. Some of the autistic children on the LOD begin to experience   heavy nosebleeds, which could reflect an exacerbation of an existing Vitamin K deficiency since on   the LOD, Vitamin K-containing vegetables have been removed from the diet. The bodyâ€™s first priority   use of Vitamin K is manufacture, in the liver, coagulation factors that prevent bleeding and clotting   disorders. If Vitamin K is withheld from the diet to the point where nosebleeds develop, then other,   less apparent problems with clotting may be present also.    I believe that most if not all children with autism are producing oxalic acid endogenously and that   they have large body stores of insoluble oxalates, primarily in the form of calcium oxalate crystals.   Humans produce oxalic acid in the liver, which is the only organ in the human body that stores   Vitamin K.23 Humans are known to produce oxalic acid in response to certain vitamin deficiencies;   at this time it is known that a deficiency of Vitamin B6 will cause the human liver to manufacture   oxalic acid. I believe it is probable that the liver is also producing oxalic acid in response to a   Vitamin K deficiency.e If this is true, then reducing dietary intake of oxalates will not solve the   problem of endogenous production but could in fact increase oxalate production since a low-  oxalate diet excludes dietary sources of Vitamin K1 such as leafy greens.    Vitamin K-dependent enzymes are found in the kidney tubules, a fact which seems to indicate that   the kidneys have a mechanism for disposing of oxalic acid while preventing it from crystallizing with   calcium. However, without Vitamin K these enzymes cannot work, which may lead to the formation   of numerous CaOx crystals in the kidney tubules. Once the kidney tubules become â€œcloggedâ€ they   will have difficulty in excreting many substances, including oxalic acid, metabolic waste products,   toxins, and heavy metals.    Another means of disposal of oxalic acid is across the intestinal lumen into the GI tract, where   intestinal bacterial degrade the acid into harmless substances. However, oxalate-degrading   bacteria, which includes Oxalobactor formigines and various form of lactic acid bacteria (and   Vitamin K-producing bacteria too) are easily destroyed by antibiotics so the intestinal flora of most   autistic children probably does not include these types of â€œgoodâ€ bacteria. Therefore if kidney tubule   efficiency is reduced due to the presence of CaOx crystals, and the intestines donâ€™t contain the   types of bacteria that can degrade oxalates, the autistic child will have difficulty disposing of the   oxalic acid via either urine or stool, so it will remain in the body to form mineral crystals.    However, once the Vitamin K deficiency is rectified, I believe that the childâ€™s body will slow or cease   its endogenous production of oxalic acid. Consumption of lactic acid bacteria, especially those   found in the commercial preparation VSL#3, will introduce bacterial species into the intestines that   are capable of degrading oxalates.24 Soluble oxalate secretion across the intestinal membranes   will then increase, and once the soluble oxalate reaches the intestinal contents, the probiotics will   degrade it. The probiotics should able to degrade dietary oxalates (soluble and insoluble), allowing   the child to consume the healthy vegetables containing both oxalates and Vitamin K. The probiotics      e Dr. Clive Solomons found that, if the diet is very low in oxalates, the dieter would begin to produce oxalates   endogenously. The very-low-oxalate dieter is by definition eating few or no leafy greens, the main dietary source of   Vitamin K1, lending some credence to the hypothesis that a Vitamin K deficiency is one reason the liver would   manufacture soluble oxalates.      should also begin to degrade any insoluble oxalate crystals attached to the intestinal lumen.    Vitamin K appears to be capable of chelating the calcium from calcium oxalate crystals, thus   dissolving them and opening up the kidney tubules as another avenue for disposal of soluble   oxalate. As CaOx crystals deposited around the body begin to dissolve, the autistic childâ€™s behavior   should improve. Therefore\' once Vitamin K supplementation and VSL#3 consumption have been   established the Low Oxalate Diet is probably unnecessary.    Baths or footbaths of Epsom salts, baking soda, and sea salt may accelerate the process of   draining oxalic acid from the body. Oxalic acid shares the same cellular transporters as sulfur,   bicarbonate, and chloride; when the circulatory levels of these three latter substances are   increased, they are more available for transportation into cells to replace the oxalic acid. This will   bring more oxalic acid into circulation. As the kidneys absorb the sulfate, bicarbonate, and chloride,   they should be able to increase their rate of oxalic acid secretion into the urine.    Vitamin K, Calcium, and the Intestinal Membrane    A recent paper by Susan Owens, MAIS entitled â€œMechanisms Behind The Leaky Gutâ€25 points out   the importance of calcium in regulating the opening and closing of the â€œtight junctionsâ€ of the   intestinal membrane:    â€œI\'ve put a study at the end of this article whose authors discovered that some of this process of   opening and closing the tight junctions appeared to be mediated through an interaction with   calcium. This did not involve the concentration of calcium that was inside the intestinal cells, but it   only involved the calcium that was outside the cell. Removing the calcium from either side of that   tight junction could really change things, but changing the level of calcium inside the rectangle   (representing the inside of the cell) made no difference at all.\"    â€œRight next to where that gate is located on the basolateral (or blood side) are some molecules and   a \"sensor\" that picks up calcium that is travelling in the fluid on this basolateral or blood side. I\'ve   represented that sensor as an asterisk. If there is adequate calcium at that sensor, then the leaky   gut closes, just as if it had been zipped up. In fact, calcium is actually a key ingredient used to close   the zipper. When there is not enough calcium present to close the gate, the gate stays open so that   calcium from the food side can come in through the gap until there is enough calcium to close the   gate again. In fact, at times, there are oscillations that occur as this gate opens and closes in   response to calcium.â€ f    Owensâ€™ paper does not address the role of Vitamin K in regulating the extracellular calcium, but   several interesting question present themselves: Is the calcium needed to regulate the tight   junctions either not present or not usable, due to lack of carboxylated    f Susan Owens, MAIS, â€˜Mechanisms Behind The Leaky Gutâ€™, 2006, page 3    â€œescortâ€ proteins? Would the addition of Vitamin K as a dietary supplement provide usable calcium   to improve the GI tractâ€™s functionality?    Vitamin K, Calcium, and the Specific Carbohydrate Diet    Some parents have noted that their children experience problems with the Specific Carbohydrate   Diet (SCD), a diet designed to bring order and balance to the intestinal flora. It is quite possible that   the regressions the parents are witnessing are actually due to the movement of uncontrolled   calcium into circulation, regressions that would be more pronounced if the regressing children   were consuming the yogurt recommended by the SCD designers. Yogurt made according to SCD   directions would contain large amounts of both Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus   thermophilus, both of which are known to degrade oxalates. If these two bacterial species begin   degrading insoluble oxalates in the autistic childâ€™s intestinal tract, thereby liberating calcium, the   child will experience neurological problems if he/she is deficient in Vitamin K, which is probably the   case. Therefore it seems that once the Specific Carbohydrate Diet incorporates Vitamin K, more   children will be able to tolerate and benefit from it.    Recommended Dose of Vitamin K    There is considerable uncertainty about what constitutes an adequate intake of Vitamin K. The RDA   is essentially the amount the liver needs for its clotting functions; the amount the bone proteins   need is unknown.    The Japanese studies on osteoporosis in adults used 15 mg of Vitamin K2, three times daily. This   dose was well-tolerated and without toxic effects. To adjust this dose for a child, divide the childâ€™s   weight by 150 and apply that fraction to the adult dose. Vitamin K2 is available in liquid, gelcap or   capsule form. Because it is a fat-soluble vitamin it must be consumed with dietary fat.    Conclusions    It is possible that the unregulated movement of calcium in the autistic child is responsible for some   of the neurological symptoms of the disease: calcium triggers the neurons to fire; excess calcium,   or uncontrolled calcium, may cause the neurons to fire until they die. Vitamin K is an essential   cofactor in the development of bone proteins that can control calcium and most if not all autistic   children are probably severely deficient. The dietary addition of Vitamin K would activate the bone   proteins that manage calcium, thereby controlling that calcium and bringing some order to the   metabolic chaos that is autism. It is possible that children with autism have problems with the gene  (s) controlling glutamate management, calcium channel function, and/or Vitamin K-dependent   enzyme production.    A Vitamin K deficiency may be a contributing factor in the autistic childâ€™s endogenous production of   oxalic acid, which can bind to and immobilize calcium. If the renegade calcium is bound to oxalates   it cannot make its way into the nervous system and cause damage. The human body seems to   have a reason for producing oxalic acid: to control and manage calcium. It also has the means to   dispose of it once the diet contains adequate Vitamin K again: the Vitamin K triggers carboxylation   of bone proteins, which can then chelate the calcium from the crystals and put the calcium where it   belongs. Meanwhile the oxalic acid will be disposed of, via secretion either through the kidney   tubules or across the intestinal membrane. However, if the kidney tubules are not filtering well due   to the presence of CaOx crystals, or if the intestines do not contain oxalate-degrading bacteria, then   the oxalic acid will remain in the body and re-crystallize. Disposal of any other waste product or toxin   will be compromised also.    The Low Oxalate Diet is a poor method of addressing the problem of CaOx crystals. LOD uses   dietary manipulation and citrate minerals to dissolve CaOx stones, but as the child has low Vitamin   K the calcium influx is unmanaged and causes additional damage to the nervous system. The   avoidance of Vitamin K1-containing vegetables means that the childâ€™s stores of Vitamin K will be   depleted and yet the liver will continue to produce oxalates.    There exists the distinct possibility that the heavy metal chelators (e.g. DMPS, DMSA, EDTA) cause   dissolution of CaOx stones. The regressions and problems that children experience when   undergoing heavy metal chelation are consistent with the effects from the release of uncontrolled   calcium into circulation. Therefore perhaps heavy metal chelation should be halted while Vitamin K   deficiencies are addressed and calcium, including the calcium bound to oxalates, is brought under   control.    It is possible that the leaky gut cannot be closed until controlled calcium is brought to the tight   junctions.    In conclusion, Vitamin K has a number of essential roles in the human body and it would appear its   importance has been overlooked thus far. Vitamin K deficiency may be a cause of chronic neuronal   hyperexcitement, which could manifest as autistic symptoms; it may also be a cause of the   development of calcium oxalate crystals and stones, which may well be found in abundance in all   autistic children. The administration of pharmacological doses of Vitamin K to children with autism   disorders would appear to hold great promise in turning around some of the symptoms of the   disease.

Susan Owens, MAIS, â€˜Mechanisms Behind The Leaky Gut,â€™ 2006      APPENDIX B  CALCIUM OXALATES  In the urinary sediment, one can find two forms of calcium oxalate crystals. The most frequent form   is the di-hydrated calcium oxalate. The mineralogical name of the calcium oxalate 2(H2O) is   Weddellite. The second form is the mono-hydrated calcium oxalate whose mineralogical name is   Whewellite. The two forms have different crystallographic characteristics. It seems that the   calcium/magnesium ratio plays an important role in the formation of the calcium oxalate crystals.   Crystals of calcium oxalate are found mainly in an acidic urine, but these can also be seen in   slightly alkaline specimens.    Weddelites: Calcium oxalates 2(H2O)                    The weddelite or calcium oxalate di-hydrate crystallizes in the tetragonal system. The classic crystal   shape is the eight-face bi-pyramid. In bright field microscopy, the weddelite crystals are recognized   easily by their shape that reminds a mail envelope. More complex shapes of weddelite are   possible. The dumbbell shape is not rare. The former has no precise angles or sides. This form is,   in reality, an microcrystalline agglomerate that takes the shape of a biconcave disc.  Weddelite crystals are poorly birefringent and do not show any interference pattern under polarized   light.    Weddelite crystals are usually of little clinical value. Many specimens develop weddelite crystals on   standing.    Whewellites: calcium oxalates (H2O)                                      The whewellite crystal is a rare form of crystallization of calcium oxalate. In theory, the whewellite, or   calcium oxalate mono-hydrate crystallizes in a monoclinic leave shape, but in the majority of cases,   the former precipitates as an oval egg shape. The dumbbell structure is often erroneously   associated to this form of oxalate. X-ray analysis have shown that the dumbbell structure can also   represent weddelite crystals. Contrarily to the weddelite, the whewellite is found in situations of   massive calcium oxalate precipitation. According to Berg, the abundance of oxalates formed of   ovoid structures strongly agglutinated, twin structures, and microliths, is an indication of a   pathological massive precipitation. Urines of patients with a calcium oxalate urolithiase have a   tendency to have a sediment with some of the preceding characteristics.

APPENDIX C    Suggested Approach to Oxalate Degradation and Disposal    1. Vitamin K2, adjusted for the childâ€™s body weight by dividing the childâ€™s weight by 150 and applying   that fraction to the adult dose of 15 mg TID. (I am using the liquid from Thorne Research.)    2. Magnesium, which closes the calcium channel.    3. The commercial probiotic preparation VSL#3 (<!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.vsl3.com\">www.vsl3.com</a><!-- w -->), which contains strains of lactic   acid shown to be able to degrade oxalates in the GI tract. I have found that consuming yogurt   cultured with VSL#3 is more effective in controlling the diarrhea induced by oxalates leaving the   body than the probiotic alone. I use two envelopes of VSL#3 and two quarts of goat milk and culture   it for 24 hours. I believe that, once established on Vitamin K, children who were previously dairy-  intolerant may be able to tolerate dairy products, because their bodies can now control the   absorbed calcium.    4. Baths or footbaths of Epsom salts, baking soda, and sea salt to exchange with soluble oxalates   and encourage their release from cells.    5. Other supplements as required by the individual child.    6. The Specific Carbohydrate Diet. This diet is absolutely essential to re-establishing healthy GI   flora.    7. When Oxalobactor formigenes becomes available as a prescription product it will be a useful   addition to the childâ€™s arsenal of â€œgoodâ€ GI bacteria. But its presence is not essential to the removal   of oxalates from the body.      Vitamin K appears to be able to chelate the calcium from the CaOx salts, leaving behind oxalic acid   that can be either filtered through the kidneys or secreted across the intestinal membrane for   disposal. If the childâ€™s GI tract contains oxalate-degrading bacteria, the concentration of oxalates   inside the GI tract will remain less than the concentration in the body, signaling the body to continue   secreting oxalates across the intestinal membrane. Magnesium closes the calcium channels and   will assist in controlling neuronal firing. The sulfate, bicarbonate, and chloride can all exchange   with the oxalic acid inside cells, allowing the oxalic acid to leave the cell and be disposed of. The   Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) will address the obvious imbalances in GI flora that have led to   this situation, which include the absences of both O. formigenes and Vitamin K-producing bacteria.   Children experiencing setbacks on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet, especially those consuming   yogurt, may actually be manifesting the effects of a release of uncontrolled calcium from calcium   oxalate crystals. The lactic acid bacteria L. acidophilus and S.thermophilus, the classic yogurt-  making bacteria used in the SCD, have been found to degrade oxalates effectively. Again, as I have   stated elsewhere in this paper, degradation of calcium oxalate crystals results in the release of   calcium, and if the child is Vitamin K-deficient, the released calcium will be uncontrollable and   therefore potentially harmful to the nervous system.

My child cannot tolerate Cod Liver Oil (apparently).  We have tried reintroducing it 2 times without much success.  We are going to start giving a different form of liquid vitamin A to see if he tolerates that (on the advice of his pediatrician).  I just got it today.    L Theanine is for anxiety.  You are correct.  I bought it at Whole Foods.  It is Solaray brand.    I would not mess with lithium without talking with Evans\' doctor about it.  There is a supplement form of lithium you can buy, but I don\'t know enough about it to comment on it or have any recommendation.    Here is a thread on zeolites (Natural Cellular Defense): <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.autismweb.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6503&amp;highlight=ncd\">http://www.autismweb.com/forum/viewtopi ... hlight=ncd</a><!-- m -->    I have not seen any results on this from the study yet. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.zeoliteautismstudy.com/home/\">http://www.zeoliteautismstudy.com/home/</a><!-- m -->    I buy biotin at either Whole Foods or Vitamin Shoppe.  I have used 2 brands -- the latest being Solgar.  I buy the 1000mcg capsules.    I had heard that whey protein always contained casein.  I thought Dana said she had found some that did not.  My child does not seem to need extra protein, so we have not supplemented that.  I have heard of people using both rice protein powder and pea protein powder.  I think Kirkman sells pea -- <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.kirkmanlabs.com/products/casein_free/pea/Pea_Protien296_2.html\">http://www.kirkmanlabs.com/products/cas ... 296_2.html</a><!-- m -->   and  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.kirkmanlabs.com/cgi-bin/hse/HomepageSearchEngine.cgi?url=http://www.kirkmanlabs.com/products/casein_free/print/pearecipies.html;geturl=d+highlightmatches+gotofirstmatch;terms=protein#firstmatch\">http://www.kirkmanlabs.com/cgi-bin/hse/ ... firstmatch</a><!-- m -->    For rice protein, I saw this on the web:  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.nutribiotic.com/riceprotein.htm\">http://www.nutribiotic.com/riceprotein.htm</a><!-- m -->    I can\'t vouch for any of these products as I have not used them.    Vanadium is a trace mineral that I have not supplemented.  I have read that levels of this can become low if you are chelating (along with chromium and molybdenum).  I think you can get bad reactions if levels of vanadium are too high in the body as well, so I would be careful about supplementing this unless some testing showed there was a need.  Are you already doing a mineral supplement with chelation?  Ask your DAN! doc if he thinks this mineral may be helpful.    Found this for Bilberry -- I have not used this: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.nutrasanus.com/bilberry.html\">https://www.nutrasanus.com/bilberry.html</a><!-- m --></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</div>'
