' <div class=\"postbody\">It\' is going very bad with the K teacher since day 1, my child comes crying everyday because of the difference in the treatment. He is aware that teacher prefers certain kids to others. We are immigrants and the teacher is a little bit not very tolerant, she prefers blond blue eyes kids. He thinks its the norm because of the previous pre-k bad experience. I know that teachers will not go against each other for a child. Please note that the child is extremely bright academically and way above K level. I don\'t want my child to have a low self esteem and feel inferior. Last week a parent pulled their daughter from the class but went to another school (also immigrants).  What solutions do I have? He doesn\'t want to be homeschooled. He loves people.  Thank you for your help</div>'

I am not sure if my daughter has autism or not but either way, she does have a \"stim.\"      I always thought her finger wiggling was a habbit.  I never thought much of it, although I always found it to be odd looking.  I just assumed she would outgrow it.  She is four now.      My question is, will it ever go away?  I am new to the idea she may have autism and to be honest I am feeling a bit overwhelmed.  Before I realized what she was doing was not a habbit, I tried to get her to stop.  She was able to stop at that moment without any problems however just a few hours later, she would be doing it again.      Does anyone have advise on what I can do for her?  Do your children stim?  Do they drift off at a certain age?  Do I just need to let her do it?     I am so confused and sad I was pushing her to stop when she couldnt control herself.  Any advise would really help me out.</div>'

At home, he has to go to his room for time-out for about 4-5 minutes when he does something he knows he shouldn\'t (ex. sit on the cat).      A lot of times, I can ask him \"do you want to go to time-out?\" when I see him about to do something he shouldn\'t.  Most of the time he\'ll reply \"no\" and stop doing it.  Key word being MOST!!

However, they are seperate disorders. Many children (most? all? I\'m not really sure about this) with autism have SPD but not all people with SPD are autistic. SPD can often be seen alongside other developmental disorders and it can also exist on it\'s own with no other issues.  Dana has posted some fantastic sensory resources and links. Check in the reference section. Also, if this is an avenue you are exploring, I would highly recommend, <strong>The Out-of-Sync Child: Recognizing and Coping with Sensory Integration Dysfunction</strong>, by Carol Stock Kranowitz  I found it to be invaluable in helping me to recognize SPD in my son.

' <div class=\"postbody\">It\'s really nice to read that parents on the site have children who have had very positive Montessori experiences. I was in Montessori education full-time for years, and now work one-one with children with autism.     I have some thoughts to share that might help a lot of children, parents, and teachers.    While Montessori really lends itself to special needs and sensory issues, the teachers are like I was before I had exposure to the subject of autism and other conditions. It\'s great that a good teacher usually tunes into each child individually, and \"gets\" what a child is experiencing.     Montessori teachers ASSUME that no one child is going to be like another. Montessori teachers see it is their job to support the child by working well with parents, who are of course the first and will always be the most important teachers for any child. This is how they are trained. But they are usually not trained to work with children with special needs, per se, nor how to talk with parents about their observations when a child presents with behavior or learning differences. This is an aside...but Montessori is such a multi-sensory experience, that a child with auditory processing or other difficulties can often have his or her issues go unnoticed for longer because of the visual, non-verbal, and kinesthetic aspects of the whole experienced. (longer than would be the case in a traditional preschool.)    Parents who are involved with Montessori might consider making presentations at staff meetings as teachers are hungry for first-hand information from those they truly respect - the parents! Or, even if you\'re not involved with a school, most Montessori schools would welcome a parent with insights and first-hand experiences about ASD issues.    Right now there are a few children who have definite behavior and learning issues at the school I enjoy subbing at (between the 10 day AIT sessions that I hold). These children who could strongly benefit from OT and other interventions, though I am not surely not qualified to say how they would be assessed if evaluated. There are definitie sensory and communication challenges there also.    Neither parents nor teachers are usually informed about special needs issues and the potential that can come from early intervention. When teachers believe there are issues that need to be looked into, and understand the benefits of early diagnosis, they can be really \"up against it\" when they broach the subject with parents. Two out of three parents seem to remove a child from school rather than get an evaluation for a 2 or 3 year-old. Teachers and school admin may need some help from parents so staff can talk to parents in ways that can be heard.     Knowing now what I\'ve learned from parents, children, and other trainings, I\'d have both a way for parents to train teachers AND a parent support group within the school to offer help, support, and information to other parents.     If a child\'s doctor doesn\'t think there is an issue, which is so often the case, it\'s only natural that parents wait until they\'ve heard concerns from more than just 1 teacher or school. It can be such a hard bridge to cross to go from \"my child is doing fine\" to \"perhaps my child has special needs and requires some new opportunities\"...or \"my child has autism.\"    It would be so much more in the service of children if children could stay in this environment that serves them so well AND recieve the necessary interventions - and if parents could recieve more support around investigating these matters.    All this is not to say that sometimes Montessori doesn\'t offer the small groups and structure needed for kids on the spectrum. But many children can manage wonderfully once their sensory issues and other challenges are addressed adequately.    Jennifer</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Your son sounds much like mine.  A distressed birth.  The nerve not developing properly is also like mine--we have found out that it is likely due to a systemic mold infection. The thought is that antibiotics early in life wiped out the good flora in his gut, and a mold infection, we think from the home we lived in, got a good foothold.  He is deaf in one ear.    I would consider getting your doctor to prescribe nystatin, and take it for a month.  It is non-toxic and does not leave the bowel.  It will probably really help gut issues also; we take a probiotic between doses of nystatin daily.  My son is 12 and in managed recovery.  After doing all this for almost 10 years now, I look back and antifungals are the thing that helped him the most over the years, but we did not really understand this (or why!) at the time.  We would do a round (15 days) of nystatin or diflucan, he\'d do really great, and then we\'d begin the gradual backslide.  If antifungals work, you need to stay on them as you work to heal the gut.  Also if you get a really good response to antifungals, you might consider consulting a toxicologist or environmental medicine specialist instead of a DAN.  This is what I wish I\'d done; didn\'t know any better then, but I do now.  Good luck!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hey everyone,  I have been super duper busy and just when I got time to catch up on this forum...my computer was giving us trouble-ugh!!  I hope everyone is well and gosh, I feel like I have been away from my family although it has only been a short time!    My question is this....    My Audrey who is 2 1/2 yrs old is fascinated with books (and has been for about 2 months)...we only really give her picture books or simple sentence books, but she has been labeling everything since she started to talk a couple months ago.  Tonight when she was playing with her Baby Einstein and Baby Bumblebee flash cards, I decided to cover the picture separately and just have her \"read\" the words at the bottom.  She never knew which card I took because I took the whole pile and covered one , but she \"read\" - dog, cat, duck, elephant, banana, apple, flower, etc.  I then decided that maybe she had just memorized them because she really likes looking at the flash cards and the words.  I then got a new set of flash cards that she had never seen and tried them...she got several of the words that she would have seen before correct and she even said \"dog\" for frog and \"duck\" for truck.  Does this mean she is hyperlexic?? Could she just be memorizing the words with the pics or is that the same thing?    I have only heard about this but never imagined she was doing that - but did notice how intently she stares at her books and especially the words on them.  Does anyone know more about this?    Thanks for any info....and does this mean we should be doing different things in her aba or natural setting teaching---should we encourage this and help or not?      Thanks guys!!  Kim</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I live in Toronto, and my son attends The Toronto Montessori for Autism. Thank goodness for this school, it has enpowered my child and the approach is amazing. It incorporates the Montessori approach with ABA..the program is structured for my son. My son get 2:1 approach (can\'t afford 1:1)...this will be his second year in the program and this year he will be intergrated with NT children on Montessori field trips and outdoor play. My son attended public school for 7 months, 7 months I wasted on giving my son what he deserves. I fought daily with that school, they were a bunch of ignorant people that left my son in the corner, the only thing he learned was how to use the photocopier. 2 months in the Montessori school my son can name every country in Europe and South America..I can\'t do that, he learns piano as part of his class, daily chores and respondsibilities...I could go on and on. BTW the Director of the School is soooooooooooooo educated and passionate about the abilities and potential of our kids. Do a search on The Toronto Montessori School for Autism. You can even purchase her manual to use or give to your Montessori school to use as a guide for educating a child with autism in the Montessori way....Amazing, warning though this manual is extremely detailed.

' <div class=\"postbody\">For us the inability to show empathy was a big red flag - particularly in our daughter(dx PDD-NOS).  She is very verbal and very social - but whenever a situation came where she needed to respond in an empathetic manner - she always gave an inappropriate response.  She would laugh when she was in trouble (and at the time we thought she was just a \"spirited\" kid), she would laugh if someone was crying/hurt.  I distinctly remember her laughing hysterically when I had morning sickness during my pregnancy with my youngest child.  Now after a TON of social stories later she is starting to get it - sometimes she overreacts Mason (dx: ASD), just doesn\'t respond much at all to those situations.  Sometimes we may get an \"are you ok?\", or if I fake it heavily during play (like start fake crying) he will cry too but those instances are few and far between.

My sweet son has already been through so much in his short 2 1/2 years that it has been really hard for me to accept that this is now another huge hurdle for him.  With that said, my husband and I are ready to roll up our sleeves and get to work to help him the very best we can!  Here are just a few of the hundreds of questions I have swirling around my head:  1.Any tips on how to balance your time for research?  I have read this forum, online and so many books lately that it is making my head hurt--literally!  I need some advice on how to balance this with all of our other efforts.  I don\'t want to be obsessed with reading about everything at the expense of spending time with my children.  Recently I have been waiting until everyone is in bed, but I can\'t keep doing this because I am so exhausted from staying up so late trying to figure out all the biomed/diet stuff, therapy ideas, etc.  2.Any ideas that have worked for you on streamlining all the paperwork---tracking behaviors/concerns, etc.  I feel like I need to document his every move---behavior specialist wants data, I want to see how different foods affect him, dr. wants all the poop details, the list goes on and on!  I am need of some serious forms/charts, something!  3.I know this is a particularly hard one, but any advice would be appreciated.  How have you balanced things with your other children?  As you all know very well, most days it feels like this child with special needs is a full time job, if not him, all the coordination, paperwork, etc.  While it is my tendency to want to give him everything I\'ve got---I have other children that I love just as dearly.

He\'s really cool.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <img src=\"http://i61.photobucket.com/albums/h44/sashasrecovery/AutismRibon.gif\" alt=\"Image\" /></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thanks guys, I\'m getting excited now! lol      Good points about the peak hours and younger kids, mmesmama and sashasmom.  Whichever gym we choose, the caregivers will have to give him more attention, especially at first, as if he\'s going to display any \"undesirable\" or aggressive behaviors, it\'s usually out of excitement when meeting <strong>new </strong>kids in a <strong>busy </strong>environment.  But if the caregivers are willing to work with us for the first couple of weeks, and we avoid peak hours, I think it could work.  Keeping my fingers crossed!</div>'

Once they get to the front of the line, let them get a prize (maybe a \'swim\' in the sink or a tub of water, or a \"treat\") Move it to a piece of tape on the floor, eventually, and have him practice lining up stuffed animals or something similar, and have him get in line, once each one of his \'friends\' gets through, allow him a treat. I think that would help with understanding getting through a line/waiting... You could have his \'friends\' get out of line, and not allow them back in, and deny them treats...this might help with understanding getting out of the line...

' <div class=\"postbody\">i can only speak for my son\'s martial arts class, but the whole basis of the class in respect for self, self discipline, and above all else respect for others.  Bullying is dealt with swiftly and harshly, they have a zero tolerance.  One kid lost his belt for bullying, another was not allowed to test the because of fighting at school, it\'s uncommon, but I\'ve seen kids running laps for being rude to an instructor or a class mate.  The reason it is uncommon is because it doesn\'t happen very often.  I would most definitely bring it to the attention of an instructor.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I agree with getting yourself healthy before you get pregnant and eat fresh organic food while pregnant and lots of green veggies.  Take probiotics too.    My son was vaccinated fully and received thimerisol in his shots.  He had such bad reactions after each round of shots that I was told were \"normal.\"  I would never give him another shot in his life.  He simply cannot handle it.  I do give him a wholesome diet with lots of green veggies and other supplements to keep him immune system healthy in case he does get sick.  My son was the healthiest kid in his class this year according to his teacher.  He rarely got sick, and if he did, it was very mild and he was over it in a few days.    With my daughter, I spaced out her shots for the first 12 months and she did not have any reaction to them until the chicken pox vaccine.  She started to get a little spacy for a few days and I stopped the shots altogether.  Both my kids had problems with the live virus vaccinations.  My daughter has an awesome diet and eats lots of veggies and drinks a green drink everyday.      If you do choose to vaccinate, space them out, don\'t vaccinate within a month of an illness, and don\'t give more than 1 or 2 at a time.  Monitor all reactions and see how your child reacts to them.  I wish this information had been available to me 7 years ago.  The information out there now is incredible and you can really make an informed choice.    Hope that helps.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Yes!  We\'ve seen this a lot.  My three year old has a few different patches that will turn very blond when he is regressing and darken when he\'s moving forward.  His hair also gets very oily when he\'s moving forward and very dry when he\'s regressing.  This also goes along with his skin getting dry or normal.  I just assumed it was him--interesting that others are seeing this.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Ok. Before anyone says stop worrying and enjoy your son, I couldn\'t  possibly have more fun with him than I do.  He is the highlight of everyday and I can\'t wait to get home from work to see him.  We have so much fun together, and I do mean together.  He\'s a social kid.    Unfortunately, there are still so many questions.  It\'s still so frustrating that every professional he has contact with: Developmental Pediatrician, 4 Pediatricians, 2 Speech Therapists, Early Intervention, Occupational Therapist all say there\' s nothing wrong besides a delay.  Of course this won\'t be frustrating if they turn out to be correct.    My boy is 18 months old and has made great strides in his motor development.  He was 5 weeks early and was behind in gross motor, but is catching up quick in that area.  He seems to understand a lot of what we say.  If I ask him to go get me the phone or his shoes, he\'ll run in the other room and come back with them.  He will answer questions by shaking his head no and he\'s started saying \"yes\".  He also will pretend to talk on the phone and sometimes will try and feed his bear.  He\'s a pointing machine and he will sometimes point to things of interest and see if we are looking.  These are good things right?     So what am I concerned with?    His expressive language, eye contact, lack of empathy,  He has maybe 6 words and I\'m not even sure they are words.  He doesn\'t seem to initiate any words.  He will answer what does a cow say, or do you want this, but doesn\'t just try to say things to us.  Maybe just labeliing once in awhile.  Is this ok?  He still won\'t look anyone in the eye when they are holding him.  He does have good eye contact when it\'s from a little further away.  He has no attachement to objects or toys.  Isn\'t he supposed to at this point.  He has no toy preferences.  He will play with cars appropriately though.  He\'s not interested in wheels or anything.  Should he have empathy at this point?    What other behaviors should I be looking for at this age?  I\'ve read all of the first signs, red flags, blah, blah, but from your personal experience- what really matters at this age?    What would be YOUR red flags at 18 months?    Thanks in advance.    John</div>'

She mentioned that there is a DTaP combo that is mercury free now.     She also mentioned to follow the vaccine schedule in her book \"What you doctor may not tell you about children\'s vaccinations\". She recommends to seperate the MMR vaccine into 3 shots giving the measels first, then the rubella, then the mumps.     She commented that if she had a child with Autism (vaccine related or not) that she would NOT vaccinate a sibling to the ASD child.

' <div class=\"postbody\">At 2.5 my son had a few words that he wasn\'t using consistently. At that time he had been diagnosed with \"speech delay, no autistic features\" (yeah, right) and was getting some ST through EI. Not helpful at all.  Regressed massively at 2.7, lost all words and many other skills (we were afraid he had CDD so ironically the diagnosis of ASD was a tiny relief), diagnosed as autistic (\"pretty severe\" according to neurologist). Started ABA/VB around 2.8 and it helped him learn to talk again. Aquiring new words doesn\'t seem to be a problem for my son because he has great memory, using language in conversational/social context is. We were also having a whopping 1 hour /week ST through EI which was absolutely useless and I ended up cancelling many sessions because they were such a waste of time. To this date my son never had a good SLP working with him. It was his VB therapist who also addressed articulation issues, apraxia etc. I will be looking again into speech this year because of prosody issues.  Alex\'s mom  P.S. I also credit removing milk from his diet very early on for a chunk of his improvement, because we saw notable changes right away before our program really got going.

Not that ABA is wrong - but why should cost be mentioned when ABA obviously costs more?

Did you seek an autistic child, or did one fall in your lap.  I would love to hear more about how you came to have him.  --Kristal</div>    In the process of adopting.  D is our foster son, who\'s been with us just about two years now.  He basically \"fell into our laps\" lol, we were approached and asked if we would foster him, based on our backgrounds in working with children/people with special needs.  Hubby worked specifically with autistic children for 7 years, and was known around town as \"the autism guy\"  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /> After D started to thrive in our home, he was put up for adoption, and after some long heartfelt talks, hubby and I decided to adopt him - we just couldn\'t allow for him to be moved again.  This kid has been let down by everyone in his life, and we refuse to let him down.    Geez I love my kid.    The hard parts though are a)not knowing his background very well, such as when he first had symptoms, what he was exposed to, what interventions were done, what he was like as a wee one, etc., and b)knowing that if he\'d been with us, and had good intervention earlier, he\'d be a lot better off.  We didn\'t get him until he was 6 1/2 - that\'s over SIX YEARS of lost time.  I truly believe that if D had been put in a good, supportive, SAFE home from infancy that he\'d be \"normal\" today.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Ok, I am not a doctor. My brother Jim is. But I work with him in developing the computer programs behind his protocol.     In our practice, we find that 20% of our patients need TMG and the rest it has a damping effect (lessens the effect of MB12). There are posts on this board in which Tami removed TMG and the things that happend were amazing.    Would you be willing for a 2 week trial to remove TMG and see if you get a more positive effect? You can always addit back if response drops off.    Have you notice pink, red or orange urine? If so, make the injection even shallower.    Lastly the parent designed report form on our website, <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.drneubrander.com\">www.drneubrander.com</a><!-- w -->, is designed to find the little things that show response to MB12. We have many patientes who do not get a big response in language so without the form they think nothing is happening until they fill out the parent designed report form and see all the little stuff happening. That is how you know MB12 is needed. Also, we find that when needed and even if not a lot of the Language part, that geat strides happen as more and more of the brain recovers.    Now, 6% of our patients do not respond to MB12. The parent designed report form has hardly any responses. These are the ones that truly do not need to be on the shots.</div>'

It seems some professionals view kids with autism just like any other object or possession that clutters their life. They are laughing at the things that make them autistic, not at what makes them beautiful and alive. I think what MCA describes is the latter and is a child\'s amazing ability to remind you just what is important in life. It\'s almost a feeling you get, and that feeling makes you laugh. As opposed to laughing first, if that makes any sense.    I think there is a culture amongst professionals as to \"these are the things we laugh at\" about kids with autism. To me, it\'s sad that they can\'t build a sincere relationship and find a unique reason to enjoy the children they are <em>lucky</em> to be around.

Just thought i mentioned it just in case you did not see it.     On the part that he had been restrained, since it was not documented there isen\'t much you can do about it.  They will just say it never happened and that will be the end  of that subject for them. Unless you can prove otherwise or have evidence,  there isen\'t much you will be able to do about that argument.  sorry.     On  the subject of being mistreated  it is sad to say but some, and I will say to this subject that their are many good and wonderful teachers that   do care about our children but yes there are very bad apples in the bunch. Evans was very mistreated when he was in florida  in the second grade  by a terribble &amp; dreadful teacher that had been working for the school system and  with special need children  for a very long  time. She was fired later that same year. She was caught  by  a  mother pulling her nonverbal &amp; autistic  child by the hair and dragging him on the classroom  floor.  She  said the child  would not  comply.   We have  to monitor our children  when  you as a parent  dont have a good filling about your childs teacher &amp; his school.      That was why i became a advocate. I started like you are doing now    fighting for evans rights, and taking the whole distic on until our names were recognized all over our county. That was not our intentions,  but by the time we were done everyone in the school system,  in our area knew who we were. I thought that was just sad that we had  to  resort to those measures to get our child what he needed by the school system, but that is how it is many times with our children.  It\'s just  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" />  I never trusted anyone again in the school system.    THEY LIE ALL THE TIME.  We are still fighting in Mass  to get him what he needs. It never seems to stops  when you have a child with a dissability.  We will never stop  fighting for him until he is 22  &amp; out of the school system.  They are  stuck with us until then. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />    You know what his rights are on Goals. You  know your proof of his intelligence is written on your docummented records provided by his independent evaluations. You have no need  to argue that  point  with them. just show them his scores on his  test, that should prove your case on that subject.     We have so many storys is not  funny.  They told  you \"We  really don\'t know what he understands \"  when i  was doing my fighting in  the school system  One day we had  our team meeting . One of the teacher  told  me  evans was  so retarded that  he could  not even tell  or recognize who he was  with his own picture. could  not recognize anyone.   Did not  know  how wave good buy. or give a Hug. That  was the  biggest lie ever. We were  so disgusted  with the system.   They  told us the best  thing for him and us was to  place him in a recidential  school because their  was no way for this child to learn.   THAT WAS IT .    We had to moved  him  from  schools, to other schools  because they  were just  giving us a hard time  until we just got tired, we  hired a  lawyer &amp;  made them pay  for all of his education.  Today they are paying $26000 for his school.   PAY Back Time.  He has a ABA program, Music,  His teachers are all  trained  in autism.

My personal opinion is that Walmart should be boycotted. I know plenty of people are poor and are glad of their cheap prices, but inevitably somebody pays for those cheap prices. The consumer does, because they dont get quality and the supplier does, because they dont pay for much for their products. They keep wages low by continuing to buy from sweat shops in the phillipines and elsewhere, and generally, their attitude makes me ill.     At some point we as consumers have to realise that we cant everything for next to nothing. Walmart, like Mcdonalds has no interest whatsoever in our health or well being.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Melanie, are you sure he <em>can </em>drink from a cup?  Is it truly stubbornness/rigidity or could he have some problems coordinating his mouth movements?    If it\'s truly stubbornness and nothing else then I\'d treat it like any other behavior and teach it via an ABA style drill, with a really desirable reinforcer for every time he drinks from the cup.  Start with tolerating having the cup in front of him, then move to lifting the cup to his mouth, then maybe sticking between his lips, and finally taking a small sip.  After a while he\'ll get more used to it and probably not fight it so much when it\'s offered outside the drill.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I would think that you should just do your show the same way you always do with one exception don\'t be as loud, I found that if you talk quieter you will be better able to get their attention because then you aren\'t assaulting their senses and in your effects because really loud noises can hurt, they tend to have really sensitive hearing.  For this kind of show there isn\'t much else in the way of modification you can do for them.  I think the whole point to having a seperate show for autistic adults is that if one of them has an issue it won\'t be disturbing a typical audience or embarrassing the autistic person having the problem, everyone knows what\'s going on and won\'t be judgmental.    They also tend to be very visual so you might want to gear your act in that direction.    I think it is great that you are willing to this.  I think that the person you were talking to referred to them as kids because in many ways they still are.

I have often heard it said that unfortunately, when you write letters like that, you are not writing it so much to the person to whom it is addressed, you are writing it for the higher-up person down the road who is going to have to make a decision about your child quite possibly without you there.  In the US, the parents are not invited to the due process hearings (I believe).  Your written words have to stand for themselves if your situation gets to that point.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Lisa, you hit on an interesting point, what in god\'s name is a \"global development delay\"???? What does it mean exactly. To me it means absolutely nothing and i have heard this term being used in my doctors office (full of doctors who didnt even have a clue my son was autistic 6 months after his diagnosis). It sounds like you are just going to have to barge ahead and do what you need to do and not put too much weight on what these people are saying, particularly these teachers.     A child is dx\'d every 12 minutes in teh US with autism. Its not like children with autism arent \"out there\" for all to see. You must be very very frustrated, i know you are. Dont let the buggers get you down and pay attention only to those you trust, i.e. someone with dx experience based on a history of experience and your own personal mommy instinct.     I have to say that despite everyone and i mean EVERYONE saying my son was just great from age 12 months to to the day of his diagnosis just before he was 2.5years, i KNEW deep inside that it was autism.     I am in no way saying that your child is \"autistic\" and there are so many variables for a child so young. But pressing forward and getting the very best help you can get and ignoring the \"do gooders\" and know it alls, like teachers, might save you a lot of headaches and pain.     From what you have said so far, your child has some similarities to my child, but not all. If you are looking for comparisons here, I could not from the bottom of my heart say that your child does or does not appear to be like my child. I would tell you if he seemed like mine.     For those who cant diagnose properly or for those who WONT diagnose, the term autism and GDD are interchangeable really. They know not of what they speak. I am putting myself in your shoes right now, and I am hurting, cause it is all coming back to me. its like they make it more difficult for us on purpose. Its all so tied up with money and resources and often, lack of diagnostic ability.     My sons first paediatrician told me what i think she wanted me to hear.She echoed what the SLT said, that what she saw in my son was \"not uncommon\". The 2nd paed dx\'d him in minutes, i think as soon as he walked in the door. She just knew. She had the experience.     The worst your son is going to get is a dx when he dosent need one. but if he DOES need one, YOU need one, to get him services.     really feel for you hun.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I am constantly being told by relatives that the reason my son doesn\'t talk is because we cater to him all the time - why talk when we\'re always serving his needs? Yes, my son is so stubborn and so spoiled, he is <em>willfully </em>deciding not to talk!     My favorite is my aunt\'s comment:  \"I bet if he stayed with <em>me </em>for a week, he\'d be talking!\"</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I guess when I think of social, I think of reciprocal engagement.  My son is \"social\", but to use Alex\'s mom\'s term, it is for his own agenda.  He will seek out peers, but for his own pleasure (ie; chase <em>me</em> or tickle <em>me</em>).  He enjoys being around kids, will approach adults and kids to initiate play, but I think it has more to do with what that person can offer <em>him </em>than it is a genuine desire to interact or connect with another person.  But maybe I\'m overpathologizing here.    A social difference between #1 and #2 is that #2 will walk over and offer me a piece of his cookie.  Seeing me smile at being offered some cookie he will continue to offer me pieces of his cookie.  With #1 I will have to <em>ask </em>him for a piece and he will make a point to give me barely a crumb, and even if I smile and make a big deal about his generosity, he will make sure he\'s well away from me should I dare ask him to give up any more of his cookie.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I just reviewed a book called <em>Independence Bound</em> in the book review section.  While there are aspects of the book I dislike, it shows how a mother helped her son, who has little to no speech as I recall, and is not regarded as \"high functioning,\" get a place of his own, a job, and the assistance he needs to successfully live without her, without his \"siblings taking care of him\" or anything like that.  That might be useful for anyone worrying that speech is going to be the particular barrier to that stuff.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I also have problems with restaining a child if its not to do with the safety of your child or another. In my sons preschool when they have mat time if my son is reluctant a teacher will put R on their knee but if he insists on not being there they would let him go. I think forcing compliance like that would be counter productive as well as being dangerous, I\'m sure it wouldn\'t teach your son self control.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">This may be more of a sign of a speech issue rather than the autism or both, but when listening to Tamara Kasper at a wrksp, (she is a speech path who learned VB from Carbone) she says that a lot of the autistic kids tend to have mobius mouth, which my son did. She describes it as having a very thin, barely there upper lip, and the upper lip looks like a hood if you look from a side view. This makes it difficult for the kids to make some of the lip formations needed for speech, and using a straw takes practice because the upper lip has to come down more. I hope that made some sense, as she described it better!!  Rose</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I would definitely say something, but do it very gently. When my twin boys were about to turn 2 and still not talking, another Mom at a play group mentioned the words &quot;speech delay&quot; to me, and that\'s what gave me the jump start to address my boys\' problems. I think before that time I was in denial.   If you could say something like, &quot;I knew someone/saw on a message board that someone/heard of someone that had a child who wasn\'t talking when they were 2, he had a speech delay. His parents asked the pediatrician about it, they did some things to check it out, like a hearing test. After that they started doing some things to help him start talking.&quot;  I would not say the word autism, but &quot;speech delay&quot; is much less threatening, and it is something she can google so she can get some information about what to do next. So if your friend asks you questions, you can say &quot;I don\'t really know much about it, just what I heard/saw,  why don\'t you google speech delay.&quot;</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">OHH, what a great post and timely for me, cause this is just what i have been thinking.     15 months ago when we started discrete trials in our lovaas program my boy could not physically put a \"bead on\" a string. He just was physically unable to do it.     That was when he was 2 and 10 months. Now he is 4 and i left that same box of beads out for him to play with. Magically he put 15 beads on the string without prompting and with no problem, pulling them through himself. he actually enjoyed it.     When i think of how awful i felt cause my little boy could not put a bead on a string at the age of almost 3!!! Now, over a year later, i truly believe that it was his own maturation that has helped him. He is stronger, cognitively he understands the connection between the bead and the string, etc etc.    WE have not used ABA intensively at all. We sometimes think what kind of little boy we would have had we used the 30hrs plus approach but our boy has made so many gains with only limited hours (sometimes only 4 a week.     To be honest, i have always had my doubts about ABA for our boy. Not to say it isnt enormously helpful in teaching and curbing \"behaviours\" but in terms of the learning curve our boy has developed, a lot of it has to do with just him, not anything external.     Speech magically appeared last august with our little guy. He blurted out \"daddy\" one day, and it has just come on since then. Its like the old \"light switch\" scenario. Where then he had about 10 babble words, now he can say any word we ask him and he is requesting as well. ABA didnt do this, though we helped elicit speech by making him request things before he got them and certainly we helped his play skills by playing with him and showing how things work.     Its a hard call for a parent, here. I am way past beating myself up and now i am quite sure that our boy at 4, who has matured so much since age 2.6 is just a more \"mature\" child, and in the process of maturing has just naturally learned things.     We all know our kids are bright, so its not hard to accept that they learn more and more as they go along, just like any other child. Exposure to life, brings knowledge.     really like this post and it could go on for months! so much to think about.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Honestly, MCA.  <em>You </em>know how to teach.  <em>You</em> know your son.  Hence, you know how to teach your son.  I can see where you might need an extra pair of hands.  But maybe you ought to consider dropping the ABA team and hiring a young college kid- probably an aspiring teacher would be best, not even necessarily special ed.  I did a lot of babysitting and tutoring during college.  I worked with speech delayed students and what turned out to be an Asperger\'s child.  I even managed to get him to eat new foods though he had extreme aversions, which at the time I remember being so frustrated as I had never encountered such a \"picky\" eater in my life.  Anyway, the only thing I think that you are lacking is confidence.  These people who are with your son now are nobody special- but <em>you </em>are.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">My daughter showed no signs until 18 months (shortly after mmr vaccine *shrug) old. Before that she was bright, active, had a few quirks, could speak beyond her age, never crawled, ate anything I gave her, would even sing nursery rhymes with me. At 18 months she just disappeared, speech, social interaction, everything was gone. She\'d stared into space for hours or screamed endlessly. Only two things from before 18 months carried over past 18 months: never sleeping through the night (until age 3yrs old) and runny stools.      Son was slow to do nearly everything after he turned two years old. It was like he was hopping along normally then decided to shift to major slow mode in learning. Yeah, he had his vaccines at 24 months, not sooner (we feared he might turn out like daughter if he had it on schedule). Not saying that is what caused it but we didn\'t want chances. Only \"autistic\" like thing I noticed back before age 2 was delayed speech. After year two he seemed to lose a lot of skills, especially fine and large motor and his speech stopped developing \"normally\" but progressed (don\'t laugh) full steam into a secret language, complete in with tones and all. His social skills never developed past a 3 year old lvl (he\'s 7 now), nor many other mental/behavioral skills. Speech is improving this year.</div>'

This line that the doctors and charities, etc feed you that your child wont recover that autism is FOREVER is clearly not truth - no not all kids will recover but i personally believe that ALL kids improve.  For me, good parenting is key. No matter what your child looks like acts like, treat them like your other children and dont pander to their \'autism\'. (Insert here a vitriol from the neurodiverse crowd)  My own child who i felt was almost completely unmanageable until the age of 5 has changed dramatically since I gave him some breathing space (no more ABA, no more behavioural therapies) I have given him much more credit and much more room to succeed or fail - i reduced my fear about him and just let him get on with things but with the full belief that he CAN do things and CAN learn.   I think so much of autism is down to us.   &quot;Oh, Johnny can\'t do that - he has never done that and remember HE HAS AUTISM &quot;Oh, thats ok for your child but MY CHILD HAS AUTISM&quot; &quot;Oh, autism is forever, no one ever RECOVERS&quot;  Many working with autism have a vested interest in keeping our kids autistic - just look at the charities and other voluntary organisations who wont ever tell you about biomed, or about \'doing it yourself\' or who do very little to help you as a parent.   Look at the number of individuals and groups who claim to be able to \'cure\' your child - autism has a huge market potential and as long as our kids remain \'autistic\' well, why would they want to recover  your child. ??  I personally know children, including my own who were written off by the doctors and teachers - all they saw was the label and how the kid looked at a particular time. So they made decisions for some of these kids like saying they had very little cognitive ability, would never read or write, etc and whammo, the kid is locked into a room for the \'special ones\'.  Having had a child who many would have regarded as \'severely\' autistic I am not speaking for the aspie end, i am speaking for the parents whose kids still arent toilet trained at 5 or 6 or even 7, the kids who still smear their excrement, the kids who dont have any language yet.   One day, my own son put a few things together in his OWN head and started doing things - he needed the time WITHOUT pressure to understand how it all fit in - but MOSTLY he needed to trust that I or others weren\'t going to judge him if he failed, and who would give him a 2nd, 3rd and 50th chance to try without having a hissy fit. (which his teachers unfortunately did)  We enter dangerous territory as parents when we talk about recovery of our kids. For me, i dont care what you call it but recovery for me means a child who can live happily and independently and who has a life OUTSIDE of autism.   When i meet parents who continue to tell me that their kids will never recover I do have to wonder why they are wedded to that idea/belief - what is it about THEM that keeps them thinking this?   I have met parents who are co-dependent, i have met parents who live vicariously through their own children\'s disability, i have met parents who make themselves victims on purpose and I have met parents who just dont know how to be a parent.   These parents have been in the \'autism\' world and outside the autism world.   As a parent YOU have to be the best you can be because out of everyone your child will meet, its you that is most important. If you buy the negativity of those around you and your child, your child and your own mental health will inevitably suffer.   The parents I know whose kids are doing exceptionally well, for the most part, were exceptionally \'good\' parents. Not heroes, not martyrs to the \'cause\' just good parents who let their kids live and just be and took every opportunity to develop their children\'s independence and personality - in this, autism didnt enter the equation - just the child. I have learned so much from these parents.   I suppose what i want to say here is that your child outgrowing autism is so very much up to you as much as it is up to the child.   I believe 100 percent my child will recover from the part of autism that might keep  him from having access to the world like everyone else. Do you know what I get from most people when I say this? Yes, you guessed it, \'she\'s in denial\', oh, pity her, she just doesnt understand etc etc.   those comments come from parents  which is very very sad.   We on this forum know differently though.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Well this is most certainly autism, no doubt. These are all stereotypical autistic behaviors. Almost all kids on the spectrum have some kind of sensory processing issues. High pain threshhold is common, as well as almost everything else that you said. I would get the official diagnosis as soon as you can, so you can begin the proper services. Depending on which state you live in, they will vary. You need to see a DAN doctor as soon as you can, and do some basic testing...urine, blood, stoll, etc... to see where she is as far as yeast, gut dysbiosis, food allergies, etc... It sounds like she has a lot of different issues. The good news is that when my son was diagnosed he had about 75% of the exact same issues as your daughter has, and almost all of them are gone. This is of course after 3 years of intense therapies, but it can happen. We are really looking at socilaization and playing now as what we are really trying to work on. He is in a regular class all day with a shadow, mainly for the social/play aspect, and he is really making huge gains in this area.  Many of his issues went away after implementing the right diet, the rest were with intense aba, private speech and OT, music therapy, social skills groups, biomed, and a great school program.  Don\'t feel discouraged, we are all here to help. The most important thing is to get the diagnosis so you can start therapy.  What state are you in?  Tanya</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Guest,  I have a first cousin who has autism who did have lack of oxygen at birth. His parents just say he is slow but now that I know about autism I am sure it is autism. He still lives at home, has a janitorial type job, has a drivers license and helps his mother, who is elderly, tremendously. He could have done so much more but they sheltered him too much (which I do understand).  As an infant our son would look up at the ceiling and move his head back and forth, had trouble nursing and then when it was time to wean had trouble with that to. He had difficulty going from one milestone to another, eating solid food, never crawled and didn\'t walk until age 18 months. Never liked baby games like peek-a-boo, infact if you sang he would scream. Large head too.    Maybe you would feel better if you took him for an infant evaluation at an autism center. They can do them at very young ages now. I\'m not saying he needs one I\'m just talking about piece of mind.

My son had delays since a very early age, and on top of that suffered a big regression as well, around 2.7. I can\'t imagine how it must feel like to have a completely typically developing child who regresses into autism.    In my son\'s case it really feels like his life began after that- around 2.9 is when he started regaining/gaining some skills, and he has progressed almost year for year afterwards- he never caught up with his peers, but he moved steadily forward, I have to remind myself to always subtract those first two and a half years of total developmental standstill when I think about his current developmental age <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /> (though he is age appropriate academically so far).  If you don\'t mind my asking- how old was your son when he regressed and did you associate it with something specific (like a vaccine, illness etc) ? I also have a 23 month old DD who does not have autism, but whom I am obsessively watching like a potential time bomb until she turns 3.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ \"When many cures are offered for a disease, it means the disease is not curable\" -Anton Chekhov</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ \"When many cures are offered for a disease, it means the disease is not curable\" -Anton Chekhov</div>'

David\'s mom,    I am so glad that you have family nearby to help out, and now with your daughter being old enough to help that must make it a little easier too.  Though it is still tough to do, isn\'t it!  Bless your heart doing everything you have to in order to take care of your family.    Dee\'s mom,    You seem to have found the ideal job and hours, that is so hard to do, so I am very happy for you!!  That actually is how my job started out, just a few hours 2 or 3 days a week.      Now I am the FT manager, I feel like I am in over my head, not that I can\'t do the job, but that work has trouble understanding that I may at times have my mind on other things, or I may be stressed from school IEP\'s or that I can\'t work because the therapist called in sick, you know?  They give me c--- for these things that pop up VERY infrequently.  For the most part I love my job and I love the paycheck, it is just when they seem so insensitive, but I know I am emotional and oversensitive, so I need to find that balance myself still.  Make sense??    C,    I know what you are saying  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /> With the new house we do need 2 incomes, just no way around that.   And I do wish I could be with D during the summer, but I will be working while he is doing his ABA in home therapy anyway, so I wouldn\'t necessarily be *with* him anyway during those hours.  But again, I know what you mean  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />     I feel like I made a mistake, that I misunderstood the *rules of parenting a special child*, that we are not to have a life, that we are to stay home, that we are to be broke.  I just can\'t do that and I (right now anyway) feel like I can\'t work FT without loosing my mind URGH!!

' <div class=\"postbody\">thanks for your post <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />  just curious - have you ever considered writing a book about detailing your methods of more typical communication - written to a fellow autistic?  i think that could be an incredible resource for our kids as they grow older.  from my perspective, the hardest part of having a child on the spectrum (now that health issues are not as much of a concern) is trying to get him sufficient therapies and the constant battle that comes with it.  it gets SO tiring always having to fight for what i know is best for my child.  i also find it troubling that he doesn\'t have any real friends, he doesn\'t have any real desire to play with other children.  and when he does attempt it, it is always inappropriate (as in, pulling hair to get attention or throwing a ball into the child, etc.).  my son is in incredible person.  over the last year and a half, he has gone from nonverbal to basic language (requesting, greetings, etc).  during this time we have discovered he knows his alphabet, numbers, colors, his receptive language is much larger than anticipated and we are beginning to see signs he can read - we did not teach him these things, but we are sure working on academic goals now!  he just turned 5 and up until 6-8 months ago, we had no idea he already had this wealth of knowledge.  he simply blows me away.  he also works harder than any other child i know (with the exception of some other autistic kids i know).  we are so incredibly grateful for every milestone he hits and for all of his accomplishments.  having a child on the spectrum has also really allowed me to appreciate my NT daughter\'s development.  she is 3 and the ease of which things come to her boggles my mind.  she has also been an incredible friend and model for my son.  1) how old where you when you began talking? i am very curious in the experience that late talkers have had and how aware they are/were of their inability to speak.    2) do you stim? did you stim? how helpful is it for you in your current life and your life as a child?  my son does a lot of stimming with his hands and it seems to be a need for him at this time.  he can\'t really express why he does it or what he gets from it, but i would sure like to know how it makes him feel.  we don\'t prevent him from doing it, but we do often redirect him, if possible.    3) did you receive a lot of therapy as a child?  if so, how did you feel about it?  my son does receive a lot of therapy and he also attends a private ABA school.  he seems to enjoy almost all of it - he seems to be really happy to learn and to be shown how to navigate his world in a way that he can make sense of.  but sometimes i worry that he has to work so hard and is he going to be resentful of this when he is an adult.  4) do you have any typical siblings? how is your relationship with them now, as adults?  thanks for putting yourself out there for us <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /></div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Yup,   Too many to list. It is scary, the things I catch myself doing that would be considered stimming. It is all JUST LIKE my son.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I agree that it could be caused by a need for communication. Have you heard of PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System)? Do you have a speech therapist that you and the teacher can consult with? I\'ve had experience with PECS with children who are nonverbal, high functioning, and extremely frustrated. It helps considerably b/c you can teach them to request specific items and they are immediately reinforced. Its great b/c its symbolic communication and it gives the child an opportunity to have a large vocabulary without the limitations of sign language (Poor fine motor and imitation skills). All you need to start is motivating objects, and two adults.    It also may involve receptive communication-he may not understand whats going on around him. I use picture schedules with my students with autism (age 3-7) and it helps considerably. When one guy starts acting hungry, about thirty minutes before lunch, I show him \"small group, circle, then lunch.\" It really helps him to know whats going on.    It may also be related to sensory problems. Does he cover his ears/eyes? It may be too loud and/or distracting, and causing him physical pain. Some kids with autism over-attend to some sensory stimuli or under-attend to sensory stimuli.    Best of luck =)   Grace (Special Ed. Preschool Teacher)</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">D is so funny (as I type this, he is singing Christmas carols at top volume from his bedroom  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /> ).    Last night, while doing his bedtime routine, D was saying \"Wallace and Gromit, the Curse of the WereRabbit\".  This is a movie he\'s pretty fixated on.  The whole point of this \"game\" is for me to copy what he says.  He likes it, as it feeds into his verbal stim, and also gives him the satisfaction of having his words/communication understood.  Sometimes I play along, often I mix it up, changing the rules of the game (make it into an opposite game, or an association game for example), and often I acknowledge him, while refusing to feed into the stim (\"Yes D, I heard you.\").    Anyway, in this case, I was teasing him a bit, refusing to say it \"properly\", instead saying \"Wallace and Gromit, The Curse of the <em>Kick-in-the-butt</em>\" (Kick in the butt is a \"funny\" statement for D).  At first he was frustrated, and kept saying, \"Noooo! Wallace and Gromit.  Curse of the <strong>WERERABBIT</strong>\" (in an irritated \"Duh! Mom\" voice).  I pulled his own sassy/bossy trick on him and would respond, \"unh-uh.  <strong>I TOLD YOU</strong>, Wallace and Gromit, Curse of the <em>kick-in-the-butt\"</em>.    I could practically see the little gears grinding in D\'s head, as he tried to figure out how to solve this dilemma.  I mean, here was mom, breaking all the rules, being a real party pooper, and yucking it up like it was no big deal!    Suddenly, he beamed a big grin, and blurt out \"Wallace and Gromit.  Curse of the <strong><em>Underwear</em></strong> Rabbit!\", then dissolved into giggles.    Yes, it\'s silly and assinine, but it was very appropriate 8 year old boy humor.  I thought it was GREAT!!! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /></div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">First, I would take her to your pediatrician to investigate any medical issues that might be causing this change in behavior. Because of her age, hormonal changes could be an issue, something to ask about. Your pediatrician should also be able to give you referrals to others in your area who could help your daughter.  If you can, take her to back to the neurologist she was seeing before (if you were happy with them). Since she did well in the past on an anti-depressant, it might be a good idea to start that again, that would definitely be something to ask the neurologist about. If the neurologist is not helpful you may want to consider taking her to a psychiatrist.  Have you talked to her teachers? Since she is doing well at school, maybe they have some ideas for you to improve her behavior at home. Some states have programs to send behaviorists to your home that would be something to look into, or if you state wouldn\'t pay for it, then you may want to see if you could find someone you could pay to come to your house if you are able. Your local autism society may be able to give you some ideas of people in your area who will do this.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello all!  I have just read all of this and wanted to add my two cents.  My husband and I had terrible marriage issues when all of this came about with our son.  I just thought he didn\'t care, the truth was that it all just scared him to death and he didn\'t know how to deal with it.  We ended up separating and to be honest it was the best thing.  We both realized what we meant to eachother and how much we missed eachother.  He now takes a very active role in my sons treatment.  He\'s even actually reading a book on biomed.  I think the biggest thing with him was that this is his \"son\", you know, the boy, the sports star, and that hit him hard. This is not a copout and I\'m not saying his reaction of ignoring autism was ok, but we all handle these things differently. All of us have vented in frustration and cursed autism at one point or another.  My husband loves my son with all of his heart.  He just had to understand that this was his son, that autism was his son and not the image of a sports star that he had in his head.  This is hard for all of us.  I will not sit here in judgement of anyone.  Good luck to anyone who is having a hard.time I have been there and it was the saddest time of my life, but now our marriage is rock solid and we are making a united front.     proudmom of bryce</div>'

The sad thing is he is such an intelligent man, but just doesn\'t seem to be interested enough in all of this to apply it to our son. That\'s my job, I guess. But I don\'t feel it should be . ..at all.   </div>    I can relate to this in that while my husband is extremely helpful and supportive, he\'s just not interested in the day-to-day details of therapy or supplements.  But I acknowldege it\'s difficult to change a lifetime of behavior patterns, so I look at where he\'s trying to help:  He does all the laundry (even folding!), and until recently was doing all the dishes, and the grocery shopping - and he makes sure all 4 pets are fed and still alive  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /> Those were things he felt he could control.  I also realized his knack wasn\'t in behavioral therapy with our son, it was taking our son out and showing him how to shoot a basketball or use a lacrosse stick - those were things he knew how to do well.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I might get lambasted by some for this loong posting this but I would just hope that when my son is an adult at whatever level of functioning, that people look at him foremost as a person who is just as entitled to have his voice heard as any other person.      It makes me sad to think that images of an autistic adult would bring anyone to tears.  I think this negative portrayal of autistic adults is the equivalent of posting a bunch of pictures of overweight people who aren\'t smiling and saying \"this is the tragic story of fat people - look at what weight gain has done to them, see how unhappy they are...\" (heard that analogy somewhere else re autistic people) - so based on a few pictures do we assume that all overweight people are unhappy?  Of course not.    Some parents of autistic children who post on this site will be faced with having a child that requires some level of long term care - does it always mean that the parents didn\'t biomedically intervene soon enough?  Didn\'t catch symptoms early enough? Chose the wrong behavioral approach? Not all kids are alike, and not all will respond to biomedical/behavioral the same way.     And for those who don\'t recover, we shouldn\'t look at them as sad examples or the tragic faces of autism - for all of us parents who are hurt when our children perform miserably on standardized intelligence tests when deep down we know our kids are smarter than what the diagnosticians are seeing, we are equally as guilty as the diagnosticians when we take one look at a person who appears severely autistic and assume he/she is unhappy, unintelligent, tragic, and by default has a poor quality of life.      I\'ve met several parents recently of adult autistics and I can tell you that they\'d be hurt and offended if I told them that merely seeing their child depresses me or makes me sad.    Here is from her site:    One father, meeting me, said,    \"You look like my son  But no.  But when you type.  You understand things.  But if I saw you in the street...  I wouldn\'t know.  I wouldn\'t realize.  But just looking at you.  You look just like my son.  Do you think my son knows more than I think he does?  Do you think my son could learn to type?\"    A mother, meeting me, said,    \"Seeing you type,  It shocked me.  I didn\'t realize people were still thinking when they didn\'t talk.  Do you think my daughter thinks?\"    A man, meeting me in public, said,    \"So what does that thing do?  It types?\"  (I said yes.)  He turned on a patronizing skeptical tone.  \"Can you tell me what we just saw then?\"  (Insulted, I did nothing, while my companion yelled at him that I could.)  He walked off muttering that he guessed I couldn\'t.    Then, always,    Are you okay?  No really, are you okay?  I\'m gonna go get help.  Staaaay riiiiiight heeeeere.  Iiiiiiiiiii geeeeeet heeeeeeeelp.  Goooood giiiiiiiirl.  Officer? I just found her, yeah.  Wandering around, she looks disoriented.  Is she okay? Will you come out and see?  (If I\'m lucky, I can leave before the cops come.)    And always, the conversation,    It starts without me.  They talk like I\'m not aware of them.  Then... I say something.  To mask their shock that the Thing can type.  They talk about how amazingly smart I am.  I wasn\'t aware that typing a sentence made me amazingly smart.  So I know they thought I was something else to begin with.  Something that does not even exist except in their heads.  But they would deny it to their last breath.  Being good shiny liberals, they don\'t like to look prejudiced.    LM</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">What you might want to do before you go is look up and contact the local chapter of the autism society of america and see if they have any informaition on which districts have better services.  Or maybe they know of an advocacy group who would certainly know which districts they have to battle on a regular basis.  Also There is a mentoring program I can\'t remember the name of (I\'m sure someone here can for me) for new parents and they might know who you should talk to.    Pluging into the local autism groups would be the best way to find out which districts are good.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">You know, this thread has me inspired again (and G-d knows I could use a little kick in the @ss myself).  I also lost 40 pounds a couple of years ago using WW and looked and felt so much better, but I\'ve had a really hard time getting back to that plan and counting points.  I am also a fan of SB and got the initial weight off after the birth of Little Man w/ SB diet, but then fell off the wagon again.  The nice thing about SB, outside of the fact that it is healthy, is that you do not necessarily need to limit the <em>quantity</em> of food.  So if you\'re a picker or a big eater, it might be worth a try for you.  I will say that though both programs worked (when I worked them), I found that I had more energy earlier on w/ SB and agree that it comes off faster initially.      I think it would be great to do it together.  Maybe we can set up a weekly virtual meeting to post about what worked and what didn\'t? Anyone?

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi respect don\'t give up. when evans was 9 yrs old my school distric did not want to give evans many of the things he was in need of to learn so i had to stay at home and  stop working. I did as you are doing with your baby now. I had to teach him to do his A,B,C,  Colors, sign to help him to communicate. Tactile language, to help him be more percetible to the sense of touch, clothing, Stop him from  placing poop all over him as Auntie said in one of the other post, cause he  would spread him self with feces all over his body. and all this was before i even knew anything of supplements, vitamins,  DAN doctors, GFCF diets. ects......     I felt as you do now very disorganised and had no idea what the ------- I was doing. And yes he was very UNCOOPERATIVE i think they know is mom so they take advantage of that  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /> but as you said it has to be done if  we want to see them advance and go forward.     I\'ll tell you a story. At that time i knew a mom who has  become my dearest friend today.  She had pulled her child out of school cause she was Autistic and the school was not teaching her to do nothing. she  did not know how to write, spell, get dress, tie her shoes, do math work, eat, ect. This mom was my inspiration. In  one year her child learn  how to do most of these things. Even thogh her child was asperger\'s  she gave me  the inspiration to teach evans and today you all have read on his progress. it\'s been a long road but if he has come this far how further can he go . Who know but i will not stop now.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />  so keep on swimming keep on swimming.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /></div>'

My son used to throw up from postnasal drip and a couple of times he breathed in the postnasal drip and got aspirational (I think this it he word) pneurmonia that landed him in the hospital. The Singulair has prevented the postnasal drip and stuffiness. It takes about a week or so to really reach a peak of effectiveness. For sleep, we use both melatonin and benedryl.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Here\'s a few that I use.  I just make ahead of the party and take a piece with us for Drew to have when the other kids are eating birthday cake.  The cake and pumpkin muffin recipes are yummy!      GFCFSF Lisa Ackermanâ€™s Chocolate or Carob Cake    1 cup white rice flour    Â½ cup sorghum flour (I use sweet rice sorghum flour)    1 cup sugar    Â½ cup cocoa powder or Chatfieldâ€™s Carob Powder    Â½ tsp. salt    1 teaspoon baking soda    1 teaspoon xanthan gum    Â½ cup oil (I use safflower oil)    Â½ cup hot water    Â½ cup milk substitute (I used prepared Vanceâ€™s Dari Free)    2 teaspoons GFCF vanilla    Preheat oven to 350 degrees.    Mix together dry ingredients and stir to combine.  Then add liquid ingredients and stir until well mixed.    Pour batter into a greased and floured 8x8 inch cake pan.  Bake for 30 minutes or until cake tests done with a toothpick. (Bake 20-25 minutes for cupcakes)          GFCFSF Flourless Peanut Butter Cookies    1 cup Peanut Butter  Â½ - 1 cup sugar  1 egg    Mix ingredients together in bowl.  Roll into 1 inch ball and place on ungreased cookie sheet.  Press fork into dough in crisscross pattern.  Bake for 7 â€“ 9 minutes at 375 degrees.  Cookie will be a bit crumbly at first but harden when cooled.  Take care when transferring from cookie sheet to cooling rack.          GFCFSF Donuts    1/3 c. Spectrum Palm Shortening  Â½ c. Sugar  1 med. Egg  1 Â½ cups GFCFSF flour   Â½ tsp. Baking Powder  Â½ tsp. Salt  Â¼ tsp. Nutmeg  Â¾ c. Pacific brand Rice Milk or Vanceâ€™s Dari-free Potato Milk    Coating:  Â¼ c. corn oil in a small bowl + a pastry brush (GFCFSF)  Â½ to 1 c. powdered sugar in larger bowl (for powdering the donuts)    Cream shortening and sugar together.  Add the egg and mix it up until smooth.  Add milk and mix gently to avoid splashing.  Add dry ingredients (not the â€œcoatingâ€ ingredients) and mix well.    Grease donut pans with either palm shortening or corn oil.  (I use corn oil on a paper towel because the pans are Teflon).  Do not overfill the donut pan pockets.     Bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean.  Remove from oven and allow to cool enough to handle.  Take each donut, brush on some corn oil to coat, and plop it into the confectionerâ€™s sugar.  Cover as best as possible, and they are ready to eat.      GFCFSF Pumpkin Muffins    1 c. sugar  1/3 c. oil (I use Safflower or Sunflower)  1 can Libbyâ€™s 100% Pumpkin  2 eggs (or replacement*)  1 Â½ + 1/6 c.

Place muffin cups in pan.    Mix wet ingredients and dry ingredients separately.    Combine and stir well.  Pour into muffin cups.    Bake until toothpick comes out clean, approximately 25 minutes.    Egg replacement:  (Add these to wet ingredients)  1 teaspoon arrowroot plus 2 Tbs. water equals 1 egg.    For second egg use 1 rounded Tablespoon of ground Flaxseed,   added to Â¼ cup hot water.  Stir and let steep for 3-5 minutes</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Anyone familiar with the Vineland test?    I dont post here often, but, I worry a lot about my four year old daughter.  Her speech is my main concern.      She passed her Vineland test.  She scored at her developmental age.  Even the speech and language part of the test.    Can a child with asd score well on the Vineland?  The evaluators made me feel that if she was asd, she would need to be developmentally delayed.    I have been confused for some time about her.  I just want answers, to know what direction her future will lead.      I always consider asd.  But, I also consider developmental language disorder as well.  Her language development fits the critera for asd - echolalia, memorized speech, etc.  She has overcome a lot over the last year and she is pretty much speaking spontaniously but you can still tell the difference between her and her peers.  Her language is more stock phrases, it does not sound as natuaral.  She does try though and she does talk a lot despite her problems.    Her social skills are ok, joint attention is strong and her eye contact is appropriate.  She has a best friend at school, she has language issues as well - they are both in a mainstream setting.    Another worry is a stim - when excited she clenches up, rubs her fingers and grinds her teeth.   She has done this since her first birthday - still going strong at four.  Although, I have learned she rarely does this at school.    Sorry for the long post - just wondering about the Vineland score - any advise, comments?    Thank you!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">I think you need to answer the question of whether or not you like teaching. If you do, then I see nothing wrong, especially in an educational setting, with letting people know more about you in this way. Just could tell them you need time to extra time to abosrb information and respond, more time than other people and leave it at that. Or more, depending on your comfort level with explaining your differences.   I think if you give them the chance to be helpful in terms of your needs, they\'ll feel happy about being able to help instead of confused about what they see in you. And, I\'m sure they see it, they just can\'t explain it.  </div>    Adults, yes. Students, forget it. Teenagers are too quick to look for wiggle room and control over authority figures. It\'s just in their genes. Everyone remembers how they saw authority figures when they were a kid. I hate to sound defeatist, but far be it from them to give me the momentary pause when they could use that moment to take advantage of me. I went in optimistic that this sort of thing would not happen, and that I could assume the best about junior high and high school kids, but it just ain\'t so. And if I cannot control my own class, I will not be an effective teacher, regardless of the support I have from my coworkers (and I have recently told my advisor as well as my supervisor about my situation in a confidential setting). Again I appreciate the support, but I can\'t be happy with my accomplishments until I can feel as though I fit in without trying to wear the figurative \"mask\" all the time.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ ~Nick    If it wasn\'t for sexual harassment in the workplace....

' <div class=\"postbody\">Today\'s IEP went like this.     Me:    DS\'s goals are too low.  I thought this back in July and told you by submitting 25 new ones.  Then I had an independent evaluation done and realized even the 25 I gave you weren\'t high enough.  Here\'s the report, we need new goals.  He probably had that entire <em>original </em>set mastered by the time he started school with you, according to the psychologist who did his independent evaluation.    School District:    DS is working just fine toward the <em>original </em>set of goals.  here are lots of fancy percentages to prove this.  They are <em>not </em>too easy.  We do <em>not </em>have to consider your independent evaluation legally but will look over it and come up with a few new goals.  We also have not looked over the 25 you submitted in July and by the way, the speech teacher can\'t make it to the IEP today, she\'s sick, but we think she\'ll probably <em>call </em>you.   Oh, and we want to discontinue your 1:1 ABA program.  Our SDC is just fine to accomplish this wonderful original set of goals and no 1:1 is needed.  So you can take the new goals we write and run them by your doctor at $150 an hour, which we won\'t pay for, and get her feedback, which again, we <em>don\'t </em>have to accept.  In fact, have her come to the next IEP, even though she lives an hour away and charges for travel time.  And remember, our reports from our district are what we go by, <em>not </em>your private doc\'s.

He can now do it on his own but it\'s more like walking instead of skating, at least he has learned to not rely on my hand to keep his balance. I would say let him do it at home as often as possible to help him practice. It\'s harder to learn when you go just once a week or so. Skating is hard!

When I\"ve tried to make a large list of activities and goals to work toward on any given day, hoping to maintain flexibility and choose from the pool of options, I find that I get overwhelmed by it at times and if I don\'t do the majority I feel as though I\'ve failed - or at least I\'ve been less than I could have been.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" alt=\":|\" title=\"Neutral\" />  I\'d probably be better of choosing just a few things to focus on in a given week, and might accomplish more by doing so.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" />     OK, I think I\'ve outdone myself with rambling thoughts and exposure of my issues for one weekend.

The goal is to make him understand that stimming is for this location only, and he will be expected to control it in all other areas.    I have read about this before. The young autistic man who does the speaking engagements - David Hamrick talked about this also that they taught him similar techniques growing up.    I can\'t help feeling that it\'s somehow cruel, though - stimming could be brought on by a biological reason - so now we\'re going to make him try to overcome that?     Any thoughts?

We see great progress for a few weeks at a time and then something happens and we take a few steps back. It has always been like this with every intervention we try. As bad as I want a miraculous healing, I am realizing that he is getting better with baby steps. He gets a little better each time and we have come so far from where we started. Try to always remember the progress you are making. It can be a frustrating journey but any progress takes you one step closer to healing.

Theres no secret im a big fan of Professional wrestling im like an encyclopedicia on it i grew up watching and Had the honor of meeting WWE (world wrestling entertainment)  Hall of famour Bret hitman hart at a convention im maryland over the summer as a present for my 20th birthday from my dad.        I have a framed picture with the man who is a true gentlemen in every sense of the word cares about his fans and has done vouleenteer work with the special olympics.  I overcame a compulsive shyness ive had my whole life when i shook his hand and said hi to him maybe no big deal for an NT but Nts are not autistic.     Autistics as many of you know have problems interacting with people and the world around them we can be very shut off from people which frusterates and saddens parents so i took my talking to him as a major accomplishement since he was the first wrestler i had ever talked to in all of my years of being a fan. i framed the picture and hung it in my room and sent him an email a few days later explaining who i was and that i had autism he sent a reply <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" />     Saying simply but kindly     Thanks for the support  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />   Bret    I have many young adult freinds at work and other places who love wrestling and believe it or not there are many challenged people who enjoy watching it i guess it just appeals to us.    I did a breif experience in January 2006  when i was 19    working on a ring crew fo  a small local promotion of wrestlers i was a little nervous but they were nice people setting up the ring was hard and im so small  5\'4 i thought i was going to break my back carrying n the pieces of wood and other materiel for setting it up and taking it down it was hard but i managed to do both.    but decided to retire from the buisness as i didnt make any money and wanted a simpler job    (i got home around 1 am that night so theres another reason right there)      In december me and my dear freind Jarred who has high functioning MR went to a local arena around here to see A WWE show  (i believe my 12 since 2002 maybe <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" /> )    On the drive up me and him his sister, Brother,and their freinds were laughing watching dvds in the van and having fun id gotten permission from my boss so id had the whole week off it was a bunch    of young adults NT and ND having a perfectly good time     <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\" />     it was the day after christmas and we were all enjoying ourselves we got caught in a traffic jam on the way to the arena but nontheless we had the trusty dvd player and a library worth of wrestling dvds (Wrestlemania 22 ) among others to keep us busy and  time literally flew i was just about to sugest to jarred to jump out of the car and get the traffic moving by doing his dead on wrestling impressions      (but still no where near as good as mine i aint letting him outshine me no way):wink:  When traffic started moving and we were on a way to the arena.      When we got in we were treated to a pretty good 2 hour show i noticed alot of people Adults and kids     with Autism/Downs/Mr in attendece all having a good time      (I cant explain it sometimes i can just tell by looking at a person whether they have autism or not) <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_question.gif\" alt=\":?:\" title=\"Question\" />  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" />   The main event was a cage match and even though it took over a half hour to set it up it was worth it in the end.

(Hi, I\'m an Aspie!)    We\'ve made a CD of music which we find to be \"therapeutic\" - and we\'re trying to share it with as many people on the spectrum as is possible.  If you like the 20 minutes or so of music that\'s available, and we hope you do, there\'s a super-easy way to get a free copy of the entire CD (or you can just buy one, which works too).    The first AutisMusic Project CD is a great draw for us, but the larger aim of the project is to bring together musicians from the spectrum to collaborate with one another and to have fun and build relationships with one another through making music (music which we\'ll compile into another CD project when the time is right - or music which you can keep all to yourself if you so desire).    If you\'re interested in music, either hearing or making it, and interested in autism (either having it or loving someone with it) we hope you\'ll visit our new website and forums - and participate by sharing some of your own music - listening to the music of others - and maybe even finding someone new to make music with!

Seems the neighbours took humbrance against our hedges and fence and decided to go at it and cut them down and broke the fence.     We have this fence and hedges to protect our son from wandering into their garden.     Well, i put a note in their door to ask why they did it and they arrived (hillbilly style) en masse, the mom, dad, 2 grown up kids and started screaming in the street at me about the note. Said they \"did me a favor\" by cutting the greenery down. Funny how they did it when i was away. They had 363 weeks during the year to have spoken to me about it    These are the same neighbours who thought my son was \"catchy\" and wouldnt let their newborn granddaughter visit in our house.     After the screaming, i told them about the need for security for our boy and they said \"that was an excuse!\"     Sheesh, how do you deal with this kind of behavior? The mom ripped my note up in front of me, threw it on the ground and stomped off muttering \"that\'s it\".  They have a big family and lots of kids, but you can\'t allow someone to bully you like this can you? This is a woman who has kissed my arse for the last five years all the time harbouring resentment.  YOu just never know about people do you?    time to move but where?

Michelle reads words accurately, but she can\'t comprehend the content. She has difficulty connecting to language she reads or language she hears. Words seem to go in one ear and out the other. People think she is not trying, and she has been labeled a \"motivation\" or \"attention\" problem. Many times this can be associated with those diagnosed with ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder), with or without hyperactivity.   Cause . . .  A primary cause of language comprehension problems is difficulty creating an imaged gestalt-a whole. This is called weak concept imagery. This weakness   causes individuals to only get \"parts\" such as a few facts or details rather than the whole picture.   Individuals with weak concept imagery have difficulty with reading comprehension, critical thinking, and may not easily follow directions or connect to conversations.  They may also have difficulty expressing ideas in an organized manner.  If they read well, but are severely unable to comprehend they may be labeled hyperlexic or high-functioning autistic, including Asperger\'s.      Symptoms . . .  Individuals of all ages may experience the symptoms of an undiagnosed and untreated concept imagery dysfunction. This causes:   â€¢Reading Comprehension  They have to reread material several times and often remember only a few details, rather than the \"whole.\" â€¢Oral Language Expression  They may seem shy and have difficulty organizing their language...or they may be talkative but scattered, relating information out of sequence. â€¢Oral Language Comprehension  They connect to only part of a conversation and have difficulty responding relevantly and thinking logically. They may ask and re-ask the same question and are labeled \"poor listener.\" â€¢Written Language Skills  Their writing is often described as unorganized and nonspecific.  Solution . . .  The NancibellÂ® Visualizing and Verbalizing for Language Comprehension and ThinkingÂ® (V/VÂ®) successfully stimulates concept imagery. Individuals become able to image gestalts which include color, and even movement. This improves their language comprehension, reasoning for critical thinking, and expressive language skills.    It is common for individuals to gain years in language comprehension in four weeks of intensive instruction.</div></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ B, 10, AS  LMB Bell V/V &amp; OCN, pragmatic lang, fiber, vits, avoid gluten, Nord Nat omega 3-6-9.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ B, 10, AS  LMB Bell V/V  OCN, pragmatic lang, fiber, vits, avoid gluten, Nord Nat omega 3-6-9.</div>'

We live in Long Island, New York and we have 3 year old twins named Sarah and Christopher.  While Sarah has not been diagnosed, Christopher was diagnosed with autistim about a year and a half ago and was in early intervention until he turned 3 in August.  He now goes to a school for Speech and Language Comm Development 5 times a week, in addition to home speech therapy, and OT.  I specifically noticed his actions changed after he had gotten the vaccination shot with Mercury, but I\'ll leave that for another post.    Christopher has been stimming excessively as of late.  He waves his hands across his face while his eyes follow his hands, he spins from time to time, he does inappropriate gestures with his hands (like moving them up and down quickly for no apparent reason), and likes to hit myself and wife with his hands whenever we are close to him, like changing his diaper.    I would like to know if anyone else has witnessed this and if so, are there things that my wife and I can do to help.  The school and home therapists say just to stop the action when he does it, but it seems to not be working and I think he\'s been stimming more as of late.    I would appreciate any help/advice and I\'m looking forward to chatting with everyone.    Thanks  Chris</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Well, I\'m so pooooooped out lately. We had the communion and then a wedding that evening. I got my \"friend\" (still don\'t consider it one) and I\'m finally feeling I have some energy back.     The priest had ordered some wheat free host and met with me before the ceremony. Bobby was with the children getting ready to line up. DH and I sat in the pew after talking to the priest. Once the ceremony started, the children walked down the isle and sat at the same pew as their parents but at the end. Another couple got in before us and was at the end next to our their son and ours so we were not next to Bobby. I kept looking over at him concerned he would do or say something and here these people had no idea what he was like.... I couldn\'t relax much at all. When we got up to take communion, I finally had a chance to talk to Bobby and tell him what to do but this was just seconds before we got to the priest to take it. I was certain he would mess up and fall apart in front of everyone. There were over 150 children there and all the parents. ugh Well he took the little container the priest had blessed with his GF host. I told him to open it up and take out his host and eat it. My angel. He did it. Thank God. By the time I sat down, I was shaking uncontrollably. I never had that happen before. It was a delayed reaction and I was shaking nonstop. It went away fairly quickly but if you saw me while it was happening, you most definately could see it.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" />     I was so glad it was over. I have to pay the priest for the host now. I know they want me to but I had so much to take care of and they got it at the last minute. I\'ll send a thank you card and some cash.

I didnt say anything about \"better\" parents, and just like you try to tarnish articles and pieces of research on this board, sometimes without even having read them, you are trying to put words in my mouth.     i think effectively, you are in your own competition to see how many people you can provoke and how many threads you can get locked.     I didnt see anything of merit in your last post. What was the point of it?    I found it mean spirited and totally out of sync with my intentions, thus, of no relevance to the topics at hand.

' <div class=\"postbody\">The best way to learn adding/subtracting and telling time is to do it.  Even if your child is a visual learner, it\'s easier to pick it up by using tactile activities.  I don\'t know how old your child is, but this is what I do with my 6 year-old and the kids I tutor.  For telling time, I use a home-made clock (have him make it out of a paper plate and some cardstock for the hands with a paper fastener so they can move).  Time is a hard concept, so it takes a lot of practice.      For adding/subtracting, I use a lot of games with objects like beans, dominoes, playing cards and GFCF chocolate chips.  If you want a list of games, I can try to send it to you.  Sometimes my attachments don\'t go through for some reason.  dory</div>'

This is actually from my father who has had mold allergies for most of his life until the last few years when he discovered this.  Two Vitamin C has been shown to lower blood levels of histamines.  Study published in the Journal of American College of Nutrition.  The recommended doseage FOR ADULTS is 1000 mg twice a day.  Three bioflavanoids specifically quercetin ups immunity and helps stop the production of histamines.  According to Dr. Marc Rothenberg M.D. PhD Allergy and Immunology Professor at the University of Cincinnati.   (Vitamin C with bioflavanoids was one of the first biomedical things we tried with our son at Tami\'s suggestion and we saw some real improvement which encouraged us to continue on that path)  Third I don\'t know if you want to try this on your kids but if you have allergies you might be interested Acupuncture.  NAET Nambudripad\'s Allergy Elimination Technique is supposed to start helping within 25 hours and in one study 66 percent had complete relief of symptoms after three months.   NAET.com    I was really excited when I found out this information I\'ve upped my vit C intake and noticed an increase in energy and decrease in runny nose and sneezing.      Anyway I posted this for those of us who would like to try alternatives to benadryl or other antihistamines (they knock me right out).</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi again    Biomedial intervention comes from the belief that in many cases autistic-like symptoms are actually caused by biological issues such as yeast overgrowth in the intestines, or a whole bunch of other things (vitamin deficiency, viral issues.)  If you treat the underlying medical problems, which are not always obvious until you really start digging and testing, you will see a reduction in autism symptoms.    Behavioral intervention does not refer to misbehavior but rather to <em>human behavior </em>that \"typical\" people pick up without thinking.  Stuff like making eye contact when you talk, or sharing experiences with someone just for the joy of sharing and not just using them as a means to get your needs met; these things need to be taught to someone on the autistic spectrum.  Behavioral therapy works great on kids who don\'t have autism too, just teaching them clearly how to act.    The mercury/shots theory is that some kids are not able, biologically or genetically for some reason, to excrete the mercury preservative they use(d) in childhood vaccinations.  When these kids get their MMR shots at 18 months, their little immune systems are so overwhelmed already by all the stored up metal in their little bodies from all the shots that the MMR shot, with 3 live viruses, sends them into autism.  The MMR shot itself has no mercury, it\'s more like the straw that broke the camel\'s back.  The last straw.  But not all kids have the problem excreting the mercury to the point where the MMR causes autism, so not every kid who gets vaccinated becomes autistic.  And I believe some kids are born with the symptoms.    This quote of yours caught my attention:<div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">She was a very fussy baby from the time she was born. They diagnosed her with colic and milk allergies at around 2 months. She also had acid reflux pretty bad.</div>  Dietary intervention for autism operates on the fact that gut issues are very common for children with autism.  It takes that fact one step further and says that the gut is actually permeated, allowing bad things through, and that what gets through contributes to the autistic symptoms.  The two biggest offenders are gluten and casein, or more simply put, wheat or dairy.  For a kid with autism, these foods can contribute a great deal toward their symptoms.  Parents of kids with autism frequently eliminate these things from their diets to let their \"guts\" heal, thereby keeping out what is making them feel so spacey.      Your description of your daughter\'s sensory issues, language issues, and the fact she has milk intolerance and \"gut\" issues are all red flags to me.    Early Intervention should pay for some behavioral therapy but the dietary intervention and biomedical intervention, should you need them, are up to you to fund.    I wish you lots of good luck and hopefully she is just a sensitive child.  But please don\'t wait too long, every day counts if she does need the help.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">What a wonderfully insightful topic.  We are working with a new \"behaviour Modification specialist\" she noticed that Luke is \"scared\" of new things, she introduces things now very gradually...first of all her only requirement it he watch, nothing more, then he will do alittle more the next time.  When he gets to the point of \"fright, flight, or fight\" she brings her goal all the way back down to simply \"just watching\", that way he knows he can not do something else until the task is completed, but she has not totally let him have his own way....so one might think that he would just throw alittle tantrum and get to sit there, well at first yes he did, but very quickly he figured that it gets pretty boring just sitting there, and so now he joins in when he is given that choice.  It took only 6 sessions to completely get his co-operation.    Another thing I find very helpful for Luke is that we always have a favourite thing (a reinforcer if you will) that he is told about, eg: first do board game, then choose a toy to play with from the shelf.  In the beginning he would not get a choice of what his reinforcer was, it would be very specific, but now that he is complying more he gets more choices, that in itself is more independent, don\'t we as adults pick our own reinforcer, eg: when I lose those 5 lbs I will buy myself those new jeans...  Also, I see this method as something that is very easy to transfer to home and to school.  Luke is in kindergarten, but when he was 4 years old and we started working with him, we had another consultant and he taught us a great method called \"pre, show, post\"....this simply is tell the child the expectation and consequence for non-compliance (keep it simple so he can be successful while teaching the method of course), then during the \"show\" the actual challenge, then it is lots of reminders, praise if doing it successfully and remind of consequence if does not comply, then follow through with consequence if non compliance, then when child calms comes \"post\" simply, the child is told what happened, what was asked, what was told would happen if did not co-operate, and what then happened, and then the child is told they will try to do it better (not right) the next time.  Ideally the next time is the next day, and this time at \"Pre stage\" the child is told what happened the day before and that today he will try to do it \"better\".  We found this method worked really well for going places because the consequence was either \"leaving\" or \"going to sit in the car\".  We have used this for trips to the beach, the park, swimming pool, supermarket, movie theatre, etc\".... infact we still use it to this day for new places, or for some of those places that we know may be a challenge for him.  It\'s really simple to learn and use and incorporate into everyday life, it is not a method to be taught at a table, more within the community, but what does work well is that it is so transferable and you don\'t need any equipment to do it either.    I go not so much for complaince, but more about \"completion of task\"...  At Luke\'s school they also taught him to say \"I need a break\", he is allowed to go and have a break in a certain area and a timer is set for him (we use timers for transitions too), he also has been taught that he must then return to the task and complete it.

You should definately hang out with little David some more, he probably doesn\'t have many/any friends, school sounds like torture for him, to hang out with someone who just understands what his life is like would be amazing for him, I bet you\'ll literally see him relax right infront of your eyes.  When Luke first started hanging out with other kids who had challenges you could see him relax, when he\'s at school, he is surrounded by kids who totally understand when he is having a melt down, and he understands when they have one...I know that a school of choice is not for all kids with challenges, but for those kids who are not thriving in the public school system it is a place that they can feel included, feel safe and actually learn.    Vancouver school board are trying to get a public funded school of choice set up and it makes me sick that so many people are against it, they say that it will lead to segregation, and that all the challenged students will be dumped in the school, but that it simply not the case, the idea is in the name \"Choice\" for children who find school a difficult place they and their families need an alternative and home schooling is not always an option, a centre where the child can thrive, have friends and be around other children who understand and can share similar experiences, smaller class sizes, higher student to teacher ratio, more qualified and experienced staff, more opportunity to learn, available resources to get therapy in the school environment, what is so wrong with that...I just don\'t understand the parents of children with special needs here in BC, they would still be able to send their kids to the local school if they are doing well in that environment, the school of choice is for families who want to choose.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Yes, I think of it as two steps forward one step back.  It can be very frightening.  He progesses in one area and loses just a bit of ground in another.  We\'ve actually seen a pattern of regression followed by big gains.      It use to be very obvious, every few months, S. would regress in his speech and have increased stims and then a few weeks later, he\'d regain all the ground and show a huge increase in social awareness and language and a huge decrease in stimming.  Does anyone else\'s kid do this?  The pattern has become much more subtle over the past year.  We\'ve seen more modest gains without the regression.  But, from the age of 2 1/2 to over 5 this was how he progressed.    We\'ve also seen regression with ear infections, dietary infractions, and hurt feelings.  Yes, hurt feelings, it\'s like living with 12 year old girl.  I wish, wish, wish he had never learned that phrase.  Though, I was reassured to learn that his best friend at school uses the phrase.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">sometimes i have caused regression in my son when i tried a new treatment. i\'ll never forget how well my son was doing on allergy drops, but i stopped them to try the naet. he regressed so badly that he looked autistic every single day. how i cried for my \"old\" joshua to come back to me, because i didn\'t know what was causing the regression. i finally realized that it was the removal of those allergy drops. i didn\'t realize how much they contributed to his well-being.      other times he has regressed after starting with a new doctor, and the doctor tried a treatment that didn\'t work well for him. or other times, he would regress before he would get better, like when he started anti-fungal treatment. that was a scary time, but he got much better.      so if your child regresses for whatever reason, the key is to find the reason for the regression, and then work to correct it. my son has had many regressions over the years, but he has always come out of them stronger and better.      totally off of the topic; he went to a halloween party last night. he picked his clothes with care, got dressed, and ran out of the house. at the door he turned around and asked, \"do i look cute?\" my heart melted, and i said, \'yea, but you always look cute!\"  terresa</div>'

The bus driver and aid said that she was sleep and they were going through a speed bump and the window seal (?) hit her. She really doesn\'t think that was the case. She is so sure that her daughter might have not been buckeled at all. They put a harness (vest) on her and it shouldn\'t be loose that she has bruises. She also sits at the edge of the seat, not by the window. When she calls the bus depot they said the vest was too big for her. she has been riding the bus for a year and my friend fuss so many times for them to provide a car seat for her daughter. they kept saying she is 41lb and she should be okay with only the vest. Now they are saying it was big for her. so they have to wait until a major accident to happen so that they can find out the vest was too big? are they kidding? what if they happen to be in a crush (god forbids) will she survive? would they come back again and say \'oh we didn\'t realize the vest was too big for her, we should have provided a big kid car seat?\" it\'s neglegence to me.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello all. This is my first post here.    After a few days of reading the board, I finally decided to post. There was another post very similar to what I am about to write, but I am a different person with a different set of problems.    I am literally weeping as I type this...    My wife and I are worried sick about our 23-month old. His daycare teacher recently alerted us to the fact he really wasn\'t communicating like the other kids. So we contacted, and qualified for, early intervention. After initial evaluation, he was delayed in both expressive and receptive language skills.    We have scheduled him for an autism evaluation by one of the the leading evaluators in the state. This will be done in July. I am so frightened by the potential diagnosis, I can barely function.    While he shows some mild behavioral signs of autism, it\'s nothing severe and probably would not even be noticed if not for the language delay.    The bottom line, as least for us, is we are so consumed with grief and worry, we can\'t even function. I made the mistake of spending countless hours at night pouring over abstracts, clinical studies, warning signs, etc. One minute I am convinced he is autistic, the next minute I am certain he is not. Every single thing he does that could be constituted as a \"red flag\" sends a chill up my spine. Are these true symptoms, or just regular toddler behavior? Has my research caused me to over--analize?    What to do? The kid makes great eye contact, smiles in response to a smile, plays with most toys in the proper way (although he does like wheels), exhibits no ritualistic behavior, actually enjoys being taken out of his routine and pretty much seems to be a normal little boy, save the language delay.    I am not asking for replies to make me feel better just for the sake of feeling better, but......please help. To make matters worse, we are pregnant with our second and can\'t even look forward to the birth for worry over our son and worry the new baby may be impaired as well.    I have a feeling he will be diagnosed as being somewhere on the spectrum. The thought of this makes me physically ill.    Can he live a normal life? Can he go to regular schools? Will he go to college? Have a wife and children?    I also worry about the stigma attached to the word \"autistic\" - something that will follow him for his whole life.    Replies are appreciated.</div>'

It\'s a hard topic to discuss but important for their safety.    <a href=\"http://www.researchautism.org/resources/reading/documents/BestOfOARacle.pdf\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.researchautism.org/resources/reading/documents/BestOfOARacle.pdf</a></div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">We taught our daughter to ride a tricycle by having her sit with her feet on the peddles.  Then we would put our hands on the peddles where her feet were and we would slowly move the peddles in a circular motion while her feet were still on the peddles. This moved the trike forward.  Very slowly of course.  Sometimes we had her feet on the trike and we should push from her back.  After A LOT of repetitions (about two weeks - maybe more), she got the hang of it and became really good at turns, stops, going backwards.  Don\'t despair.  They will get the hang of it with enough practice.  One day soon it\'s going to click for them and you\'ll seem them whizzing around the house and yard.  I don\'t know if this makes a difference, but we have smooth tiles downstairs so she learned to ride the trike inside the house.  That gave her a lot of opportunities to practice at all hours of the day without any regard to weather.   This is the trike she has.  It\'s a classic Radio Flyer from Wal-Mart. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.walmart.com/ip/Radio-Flyer-Classic-Red-10-Tricycle/12389167\">http://www.walmart.com/ip/Radio-Flyer-C ... e/12389167</a><!-- m --></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #800000\">There are many paths to autism.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi LBP.  I\'ve been off the boards for a few days but since I\'m sitting here at 1:30 a.m. unable to sleep I thought I\'d check in.  Thanks for asking.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />    We are in litigation and it\'s stressful.  I wish I could say more.    It just floors me, as I look through thousands of pages of documents, how people in the field of special education can care so little sometimes about whether or not what they are doing for a child is actually right for that child.  Seems like they send them through an autism program assembly line, railroad parents who are desperate and frequently very naiive, rubber stamp a course of action for the kid, then immediately start collecting evidence against any challenges.    I guess it\'s a vicious cycle.  They fear litigation so they circle their wagons and cover their a$$es as soon as possible, but if they didn\'t do that then there wouldn\'t be so much cause for litigation.    Grr.    But I do appreciate you checking in.  No current therapist horror stories to share but I\'ll let you know. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />     On a happy note, we\'re currently in an \"up\" period with my DS, I love these times with lots of language and interaction.  I try not to wonder how long it will last. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" />   It kills me because the timing couldn\'t be worse.      I just saw your thread about Where\'s Waldo.  I\'m headed there next and I\'m super, super happy you posted it, because I have thought that type of thing could be a helpful therapy tool.  But I ran it by my ABA supervisor and she didn\'t \"get it...\"  (\"Sure, you could definitely look at those books with him, it\'d be fun!\")  So I kind of let it slide...</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">My son has not started ABA yet. He had to meet with a psychologist today so she could get an idea of where he is cognitively. He just turned 4- did anyone have to go through this before they started ABA? She was having him point to letters, numbers, e.t.c   He became very bored with this. I left the room for a while and she came out with him in like 15 minutes and said he appeared to not be feeling well (he did have a cough) and asked to re-schedule. She said he was complying but it was kind of half heartily. I wanted to say that he was probably getting bored. She said the evaluation takes like 3 hours, please tell me she was not going to expect him to sit at this little table for 3 hours and do drills.     I asked her what if next time he does not cooperate with her.  She said she gets all kids to cooperate......okay.    While I do see some benefits of ABA, I told her that my concerns with my son are more of his play skills (or lack thereof)and interacting with people. It seems that ABA focuses a lot on rote and academics. My son is very strong in those areas. She said that the goals are based on what areas your child is lacking in- it could even be potty training or self feeding, is this true?    I don\'t want to make the wrong decision. I just want to make sure that my son receives the most appropriate therapy for him. Any input is appreciated.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">My son is in a spec. ed. HS.  He reads at the 3rd grade level, with comprehension, and does math without a calculator through division and can apply the operations to word problems as long as the word problems are at a language level he understands.  He is not at a discrete trial level.  The consultant who suggested the ABBLS assessment (the consultant who is no longer available to us) thinks that the our son\'s language issues are because therapists in the past pushed him along, since he could \"get\" higher level language skills without REALLY being sure that all the basics skills were mastered.  His recommendation was to use the ABBLS assessment to try to try to tease out the deficits.  However, the idea was to use the ABBLS to come up with the IEP goals, not actually to use discrete trial. I am confused as to what to make sure the District tells the spec. ed. HS to do.  Also, the ABBLS assessment was done nearly a year ago.  I think some of the assessment was incorrect anyway since it was done by people who didn\'t know him all that well (long story).  How often is an ABBLS assessment done?  Is it used outside of an ABA program?  I am desperately trying to find ways to help our son\'s expressive language. He has a pretty normal vocabulary, but he can\'t get a handle on grammar and syntax in normal speech, so he oftentimes throws bunches of words that have to do with the thing he wants to talk about together and hopes for the best. The BAD part is that many people actually UNDERSTAND what he\'s getting at, so the incentive to speak properly is weak.  I\'m feeling lost about what to do to help (BTW, he\'s been getting 5 days a week of speech therapy for nearly 13 years and he\' STILL on the 5yo level with huge splinters).</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Rainman,    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">its the people around the child who suffer and not the child himself because the child is isolated and cant understand what he is doing wrong or that he is not living up to others expectations.  That is the cruel irony of autism not what happens to us but the people around us. </div>    I really like how you said that. Sounds like a lot of the troubles you faced weren\'t because of your autism, but how other people treated you. In my family one of my parents was not that accepting of me and wanted me to be like a normal kid, and that parent really was unhappy and suffering because of it (we\'re finally getting along better now that I\'m older). My other parent always accepted me for who I was, and the two of us were happy and got along great. It\'s part of the reason I\'m against trying to cure autism, since I\'ve seen how unhappy wanting that makes people, and also how happy acceptance can make people.    I also agree that not all challenges are bad, and can make people stronger. You seem like a very good and strong person.     Anyway, I hope you feel better soon.</div>'

They do snacks that are on the diet and everything.  I consider myself very lucky and I truly believe that being around typical children truly has made a difference in my son.  Like I said before, he has friends, one in particular, who just really love him.  For some reason there is this other boy who has really taken to Bryce.

My son has health insurance through Pa and private through my husbands workplace.  Do you have that out there too?  My son is in a private school for autistic children.  He\'s low functioning.  The student teacher ratio is very very high.  2 to 1. This is paid for by the school district too.  My son also gets home hours with a tutor paid for by the state, Dept of Public Welfare, 18 hours of services a week total.  My son also has MR diagnosis.  There is very little money he gets for this but a couple hundred is better than nothing.  What is it like accessing services out there?   What is it like out in Indiana or even Kentucky?  My husband works in Mount Vernon Indiana close to Evansville.  Can someone give me some insight as to what basically goes on?  What is life like out there in Indiana?

' <div class=\"postbody\">Dearheart,    My son is 8 years old and he is VERY high functioning.   He started talking around 2 and did minor hand flapping.  He was very social (unusually so, I would find out later), had decent eye contact and had great pretend play.  So we didn\'t have many red flags when he was very young.   He started having trouble socially when he was at an age where he was expected to play with kids independently (2 1/2-3).  He would grab them and want to touch them all the time, and his lack of social skills really showed through, but I had now idea what that meant.  Everyone told me he was immature and he would learn to stop behaving this way.  We had him evaluated at 5 1/2 and we were told that he did not have Aspergers (I think he does).  He doesn\'t fit the typical mold.  They recommended OT for the sensory issues (touching the kids too much) and social skills classes.      We have done MB12 shots, GF diet and Liver Life.  We have seen gains with each.  He no longer touches others inappropriately and his social skills have improved.  He still has a ways to go, but I see a light at the end of the tunnel.      What I\'m trying to say is, just because your son is social and has good eye contact and likes pretend play doesn\'t mean he\'s not on the spectrum.  My son doesn\'t have trouble transitioning and that was a major reason they did not classify him.  They were not interested in his loose bowel movements.    Going to see a DAN doctor was a great thing for us.  It was wonderful to see a doctor who put all of my sons symptoms together and finally saw Autism.  I know that sounds crazy, but I KNEW!  Now I knew we could start recovery.    It\'s a long road, but so worth it.    Liz</div>'

The Hanen approach has some really useful tips for increasing language in your child, speak lots to your child, depending on what you are trying to achieve will dictate how you interact with the child.    Post about what you feel your child needs to work on right now and I am sure that there are other people on this site who can give some useful pointers in how to encorporate tasks to get the concept across.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Please understand I don\'t mean to say there\'s only one way to learn.  This is how it works the majority of the time with NT kids.  When I think about it and add on the auditory difficulties ASD kids have, as well as the rigidity about changing an approach once it\'s been learned and in place for a long time, it seems to me that an ASD child might not want to go backward and relearn willingly.  But just like everything else, each of us is different, and if it\'s worked for others, that\'s great.  I\'ll duck out now, but best of luck to everyone. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /></div>      <span class=\"gensmall\">Last edited by <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8&amp;sid=ddd8aa22bbb94ce8b75a49a5774b6416\">MCA</a> on Fri May 04, 2007 5:52 pm, edited 1 time in total.</span>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I, too, wonder if your daughter has been evaluated for apraxia, specifically because you mention her saying words once but not being able to repeat them.  This is a very common scenario with apraxic kids. It\'s like they can\'t remember how they were able to physically form the word the last time, though the sound may be perfectly clear in their own head. I believe I\'ve also read about some tendency to whisper words as well.

I\'d second the suggestion of using the flushing as a motivator, you may need to let him flush for going into the BR at first, and then again for going, but it will probably work well once he understands what he needs to do.

Anyway, the package arrived today and when my DS opened it he was upset to discover that in the Queen box was a different Barney video.  I feel sure it was an honest mistake and I\'ve emailed the seller, but he is so upset.  He has calmed down a bit now, but he banged his head and screamed off and on for hours after the mail arrived today!

I feel like the people who want to go out and tell people about Jesus, and knowing Jesus is the only way to save them, and that they need Him... and they want nothing to do with the cure.  The one thing they need the most, they turn away from.    So I go tell people about their kids being poisioned...about a possible solution, something they can just \"try\"...and it is \"TOO HARD\" or they just don\'t want to bother.    It just blows me away...I just cannot fathom someone not even wanting to TRY.  The other option is a  lifelong disability..  the other...possible reovery.    I just don\'t get it.  Yet, I keep going...trying to let people know.

Kind of similar to the ABA you parents use with some of your kids But it had a different name and was meant for dominent basset hounds.

' <div class=\"postbody\">It is SOO overwhelming.  I never feel like I am doing enough.  ABA, ST private twice a week, OT private twice a week, special ed with ST/OT through school.  Not to mention hours on line.  Wreaked havoc on my marriage.  Church was difficult to attend for months.  And the money--we will never be able to retire.     My child is 5 1/2, was diagnosed at 3 yrs 9 months.  He did have verbalizations, and I could understand about 1/4 of what he said, but was at about an 18-24 month old level.  He was the kind to where everything was difficult--getting in and out of a car, changing his diaper (toilet trained at 3 yrs 6 mos), even watching TV if you didn\'t repeat things like he wanted.  And he was a major hitter--he would hit us several times a day.  With transitions, changing clothes, anything.      Fast forward 2 years almost to the DAY (6/10).  He is getting ready to start \"typical\" private kindergarten.  He talks all the time, though is still delayed compared to his peers.  He ties his shoes, dresses himself, has little friends.  He does karate.      I will never forget the day he started real pretend play.  Sitting at the table with Winnie the Pooh, he said \"Come on pooh, are you hungry?\"  Not long after that, he commented on my shirt \"I like your yellow shirt.\"  There is a language delay and it wasn\'t said perfect, but it was so awesome.       You can do it.  Get in on a good group (this group is awesome) where you can vent, research modalities.  Look on youtube under autism recovery (or something similar).  Get on Talk About Curing Autism--they have recovery videos there.  Dr. Neubrander\'s website is great, too.  I watch those videos and it just fires me up to do even more.

' <div class=\"postbody\">your child\'s symptoms are alarming and are of concern.  In my experience, lack of language at age 3 is the first area of concern, and a red flag.  Second, your child is showing lots of rigidity.  This rigidity is a huge issue, and needs to be addressed.  I know, because im in similar situation with my son.  my son had big time rigidity issues, and suffers from a lack of speech.  My speech therapist has diagnosed him as having a very mild form of autism.  My doctor has said, he is fine and would not worry about it.    My advice to you is to be very proactive.  relatively minor changes in diet can have a huge impact on behavior and speech.    I would recommend a GFCF diet asap.  After a month of GFCF, I would add other supliments.  We just started him on Cod liver oil and it has made a noticable difference in his behavior.    My goal with my son who is borderline, Is to hopefully keep off the spectrum.  after my research, I believe that relatively small changes can have a huge impact.  Good luck, and if you have any questions, shoot me a pm.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">David,    I think most parent accept their children. For some who are more severly affected than you are, the parents would want to raise the childs level of functioning so that they can be at least independent when the parents are no longer around to care for the child.    For others who experience regressive autism, they feel that the child was developing normally and something interfered and would like to restore that which they had before. This does not mean they do not accept the child, but it does mean that they will try to find out what happened to the child and treat those issues that caused the regression.     Parents love their children. They are doing the things they feel will give the child the best chance in life at being happy.    For some children, the symptoms of autism can disappear. I have too many children that have lost the diagnosis at our clinic to believe that once autistic always autistic for all people affected with autism. But for many who come to our clinic, autism will always be a part of life. For these we can try to lessen the severity and grant more functionality to the child.    I think that as a person grows up with autism, they become comfortable with it and how it effects them. Autism does not define the person, but autism can effect how a person relates to others and their environment. From my reading of your entries, you are a caring and compassionate person. Autism does not define that, your character defines this for you. Autism though does seem to define some of the sensory issues you have. You have learned how to relate and deal with autism. But your character has defined how you deal with others.    Your character is your greatest asset. This is what you bring to the table that parents on this board are attracted to. Your views on autism greatly help parents who seek to understand how their child relates. You are providing invaluable information for parents in giving perspective on autism and how it affected you.    What I find really unique is that you are not condeming parents for trying to help their children overcome the issues that autism presents. Even though you do not wish to be \"cured\" you are not condeming parents who are seeking to overcome autism. I often hear people with autism advocate acceptance but are intolerant of accepting a parents wishing to help their child. David, you are one of the very few I have met who practices true acceptance.     I feel priveleged to have met you and I think this board is a better place with your input into the issues facing parents today.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">You usually start in the room for a child who stims all day what would they care.  Then you can adapt to the child.  Some children have never been to a park as they are not functional once the child goes to the park you let them lead.  You do not end up spending all of your life in the room.  One thing I remember from the book was that once they started eating dinner at the table with him if he was stimming they would do it too.  The whole family.  If he wanted to run around the table they let him.  Their son now runs the Sonrise program and would be in his late 30\'s about my age and he has no signs of ever having Autism.  They also let their son mentor another child with Autism they worked with.  He was very helpful and understanding and still a child himself at the time.  I totally recommend the Book Sonrise.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Tami,  I just remembered this....    About 3 or 4 yrs ago (Bobby was probably 4 or 5) I put Bobby in a pre-school sports vairety type class thru the YMCA. The teacher there is suppose to be the best, works really well with the chidren... I used to jog around the gym they had class in so I was always there watching him as I went around and around. SO... one day the teacher came up to me with a very stern look on her face and was MAD. She said, \"Bobby said the S word today.\" I was SHOCKED. I didn\'t know what to say and I felt so ashamed and wondered why he would say such a thing. She said, \"we don\'t allow that word here...\" I said I would talk to him (what else can you say) and she added, \"we don\'t allow the word stupid to be said here.\" Well... as you can imagine my face must have shown every sign of RELIEF all over because the teacher became even MORE ANGRY and said, \"well WE don\'t allow that word here or at MY HOME. WE don\'t allow it...\"    It did bother me that I was reprimanded as if I was a bad mom and at the time I did not know Bobby was asperger\'s so I really didn\'t have anything to say but \'I\'m sorry\' and \'I\'ll talk to him\'. If I knew he had asperger\'s I could have easily told her that he has trouble holding back his emotions...     After all this time what I learned....

And there you were witnessing the whole thing. She probably wanted to avoid any more conflict.     One thing is for sure, that sing song thing would have totally aggravated me but you handled it real well!

We had to stop asking this child over but not really because of the child but because the mom who never, ever reprimanded her son when he and my son had \'fights\', and they had plenty. One time her son faked tripping and crying to act as if my son did it. I saw the whole thing from beginning to end. I told the child to get up and Bobby didn\'t trip you... stop telling lies. If he told his parents, I\'m sure they figured I had it wrong and their son was right. I\'m very sure of that. Another time my son fell at their house and I had to go pick Bobby up. The little boy kept screaming it was Bobby\'s fault. Oh! My son\'s kness were dripping a huge stream of blood down his leg into his sock and shoes and the mom said NOTHING to her child to stop. I kindly said to him \"it\'s ok, kids get hurt and it\'s nobody\'s fault. It\'s ok...\" Finally the grandma told the boy in a very stern voice \"stop it, be quiet, stop it....\" I can tell you many stories of how this child tried to get my son into trouble. I don\'t understand why but I noticed this behavior with certain ADHD children. Anyway, I used to need at least 2 weeks off from playdates after having this child over and there was no special thanks or fairness from this mom. It got to the point, there was no positive in getting these boys together at all espcially when Bobby would celebrate when he left  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /> so I stopped inviting him and that was it.     Now we have another mom with a child diagnosed with ADHD and has the same behaviors as the first child I described BUT the mom is fair, willing to reprimand her son when he does wrong. It\'s a whole different thing. She\'s not ingoring bad behaviors AND she told me about her son\'s condition. This is a much more healthy situation and Bobby can see the other mom reprimand the other boy when he says or does something wrong. It\'s still not easy to deal with this child BUT I know it\'s appreciated and also i know the mom will understand if I need to talk to her child if he does something wrong.     As long as that teacher works with you on these issues including her own adopted son, you will make it through just fine.    Well I rambled on again... hope this makes sense!     (HUG)  audrey  p.w. You\'ve worked so hard and your such a good mom. Take care and don\'t let things get to you that shouldn\'t. It\'s not worth the time.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ B, 10, AS  LMB Bell V/V &amp; OCN, pragmatic lang, fiber, vits, avoid gluten, Nord Nat omega 3-6-9.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ B, 10, AS  LMB Bell V/V  OCN, pragmatic lang, fiber, vits, avoid gluten, Nord Nat omega 3-6-9.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">It\'s like I\'ve always said, many times it TAKES intelligence to recognize intelligence.  Poor babies.  Teach him to spell, words do not fail my son.  He relies on them. He asks \"What does that spell?\" constantly.  Teach him to read as early as you can, bypass the auditory processing difficulties.    I too have made that observation in the parents of the special needs kids I have personally talked to or at school meetings, on this board, etc.  Definitely above average in intelligence.    Our poor babies.  I am so angry how they\'ve been so robbed and not all have the fortune of having parents that are try so desperately to help them regain function. The Gavins, the Rys, the Bobbys, the little herbs, the Alexes, etc all have exceptional parents that are giving them a voice. God only knows how many countless are being tucked away, warehoused, forgotten like throwaway children, damaged little dolls with glassy eyes and blank stares.  Put Jr. in the attic.    I had my second pediatrician show me the door.  Told her off in person, by fax and soon by certified mail.  My boy has been having serious regression the likes which of haven\'t seen in a very long time due to IMO yeast? and she wouldn\'t even order tests to show mineral levels or yeast.  His growth has been slowing down somewhat. Doing this c--- on my own, blind, except with the help of a few of the generous terrific Moms on this board.  Ped said she \"wasn\'t going out of her way\" Said all those theories were \"conjecture\".  Told her she was refusing to treat a very physically sick child and there was no justification for it, NT or not. Physically ill is physically ill. I told her there was more than enough hard science out there but she was making  a business decision at the expense of my son\'s health and physical well-being.I told her it\'s much easier be dismissive than to face the fact that she had pushed the poison like a good AARP soldier if that helped her sleep at night.  All for that end of the year vax co. bonus. Told her that you people inject them with poison, damage them, and then dismiss them with a wave of your arrogant hands. In summary, I told her and told her and told her....If I sounded like a rabid dog it\'s cause I feel like that and yes, I know I  need to channel that anger more constructively.  I am frustrated because some serious activism is what it is going to take and I don\'t have the time nor the energy nor the resources to get it done. I want to so badly though. God knows I am more than inclined to do so. Lord, I\'m so strapped for cash I can\'t even make it to the rally. The mainstream medial community AAP? needs to be sued for refusal to administer medical care to a very sick population, every state needs to legislate strong anti-thimerosal laws, stronger environmental laws, insurance companies need to cough up more comprehensive coverage, ABA  should be a right not a priviledge, and early diagnosis should be the law of the land. It is up to parents to advocate that there be a paradigm shift with educators and mainstream medicine.  The children  are being discriminated against and written off  because their strongest advocates and potential activists(we parents) are so saddled by the emotional and financial burden (SORRY MOMS AND DADS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN) that we are doing everything we can just  to to keep our families afloat.  I despise most doctors and never bought into the theory that they were just following orders.  Didn\'t they look into our children\'s innocent eyes and wonder just what could be in these vaccines when they stuck them? I know I did but trusted that the docs, pharmas would never do such a thing. What are they, mindless drones? I don\'t buy it for a second.  I am way, way past being a lady, being polite, being diplomatic. I will stop short of physical violence but will say what I have to say to whoever I have to say it to.  Anyone know how to get to the rally on the cheap BTW?

' <div class=\"postbody\">I was in the most extreme situation of this type that you can imagine.  I had to tell my son that I believed there was something \"wrong\" with his son!!!!  How I dreaded that day.  To begin with my heart was broken and then to think of breaking his was awful.    I am a terrible worrier so when I told my son (GS was about 16 or 17 months) he told me \"Oh, Mom, there is nothing wrong with him....go and find something else to worry about\".  He didn\'t really say it rudely, but it told me I was going to have to wait for a while.  I never mentioned it again but I had known for a couple of months when I finally told my son.  Nobody else in the world noticed anything but me...but, at 18 mos. he was dx\'d as being \"mildly\" on the spectrum.  That began his journey to recovery...a journey he is still on.    He is now six and talks up a storm and in most ways is indistinguishable from NT kids.  He is our pride and joy.....how we love him!  I suggest you keep the child in mind.  Of course, be as kind as you can, but remember the child is the important one in all of this.  If your niece gets angry....oh, well, she will either get over it, carry a grudge, or...most likely...thank you some day for caring enough to point out the truth.  If I can do it with my son....you CAN do it with your niece...I guarantee it <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclamation\" />  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /></div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I just wanted to point out something about giving our kids the \"cocktail of 20 or 30 vitamins and chelation\" being experimentation.  Yes we are BUT these are vitamins that we know won\'t HARM our kids.  We know what is in the vitamins we don\'t know what is in experimental drugs.  And all we have to see to be wary of experimental drugs are the recalls of so many drugs released in the last few years.  So while our experiments with the vitamins might fail and not help at least they won\'t hurt either, the same cannot be said for drugs.    Also I believe Doctor Neubrander is running a clinical trial with the MB-12 shots.</div>'

I think on the reward issue he will eventually understand the nuance, as his understanding is pretty good as long as we aren\'t talking about things too abstract. LMP- yes, we are having a lot of fun with those strawberries- the latest is making a smoothie together and then taking a picture of A with a \"strawberry moustache\".   On the flexibility- it\'s ironic how in ASD even good traits can be exacerbated and start looking weird. At least that\'s my conclusion. Many of my son\'s likes are reasonable, including the schedule thing (I hate schedules, but whatever- I can see why many people like/need them), the computer thing, the math thing etc,etc, but he pushes them to where they start to look too perseverative and no longer productive.  MCA- I don\'t think A is conversational enough to worry about topic sequencing right now <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" />. I\'m trying lower-level flexibility exercises, which can be as simple as substituting a word in a book/song with a different word (it took a while for DS to \"accept\" my \"mistake\" ), putting a yellow bear in the green bear cup (ds looks perplexed) or declaring one morning that today we will call him \"Balex\" instead of \"Alex\". Just an hour ago- I was putting him to bed and he chose a book to read, and I said that tonight we won\'t read the words, we are just going to talk about the pictures. He didn\'t like it and kept trying to revert back to the comfort of the written text (though he gets credit for going along with it). redisthecolor - too funny about your daughter raising her hand to speak !!

Never be alone in a meeting with people, because it can later become your word against theirs what happened and what was agreed to.    Also, I learned this from California\'s developmental disability system:  Never sign a paper that they say is \"to prove you were at the meeting\".  I did that once, and got an Individual Program Plan (IPP) back later that attached the paper I signed as proof that I\'d approved the IPP.  The IPP in fact included information that was totally false (physical medical diagnoses I\'d never been given, refusal to print diagnoses my doctors had faxed to them, work history I didn\'t even have, etc) and that I would never have signed off on.  It was claimed that I had \"told them all that\" (I hadn\'t) and that I had no business disagreeing since I\'d signed the paper.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I say that I do believe the vacs caused my sonâ€™s AUTISM because it was like he brain was erased within a 2 week period after receiving his 15mth shots including the mmr and another one that had the mercury in them. He is my only biological son &amp; so I have no other babies to compare him to except my stepson which I didnâ€™t meet till he was 4 &amp; is overly intelligent for his age. I do look back sometimes and try to think if there were things he did before what we call â€œD DAYâ€ (the day his mind was erased) that would have been considered weird or un-normal. But, I think that after AUTISM you will always question everything. (you do as a mother anyway)     My son crawled, walked, sat up &amp; talked on time. At 15mths old when â€œD DAYâ€ hit, he could say aprox. 30 words, was starting to name body parts, play games with you, was a happy baby &amp; was not overly sick. After â€œD DAYâ€ all that changed, he quit talking completely, started crying all the time for no reason, appeared to be deaf, started stemming &amp; lining things up, was sick all the time &amp; was almost OCD, just completely withdrew himself.     I do feel like I lost my son &amp; am still trying to get over holding a grudge against the AUTISM. I do want another child but want to adopt a 1 1/2yr old.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I can\'t say they\'re really doing any true ABA with him at school. They are all trained in ABA, especially our lead special ed teacher, but I think he just benefits by the shadowing and the pull outs for individual work. He just really benefits by that one on one teaching within the classroom setting.    It\'s either been the motivation of the other kids, or the mB12 - but probably a little of both that has helped him. The stimulation of the school environment helps.     There are also times when I\'m not sure he\'s getting it either, though  ..but he is a young 5 to be starting kindergarten as well. Many of these kids are turning 6, especially the boys. A lot of them get held back, then they seem like the superstar kindergarteners when they are more advanced than the young 5\'s.     But what happens is that the advanced kids get  a different form of instruction, and different activities to work on, while our not so fast kids get the more basic stuff. it\'s ok, but i\'m also wondering if they\'re too happy to have him proceed more slowly?     We always have the option to hold him back also for another year.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Forgot to add.  That last link is for \"Missing Pieces\" by Mark LeLand.  If you haven\'t watched that video, it is very powerful.  He wrote it for his manager\'s son.      The largest motivation behind this CD is the title track, â€œMissing Piecesâ€.  Lelandâ€™s manager and long time friend, Tim Calhoun, is the father of Nathaniel, the inspiration for this song.  Nathaniel, like 1.7 million other children, is autistic.  After listening to the stories of the challenges that families face in receiving treatment for their children diagnosed with autism and watching the pain his close friend was facing, Leland began to learn more and more about autism.  Together, Calhoun and Leland wrote â€œMissing Piecesâ€.  It is a touching song that takes a listener through the anguish of having a beautiful baby whose neurological sense become challenged in the first few years of life.  The autism community faces a constant struggle of learning about the causes of this terrible disease and the ever-changing ideas on effective treatment.           The philanthropic loyalty that Leland has towards helping this often unnoticed group of dedicated parents has been the basis of his decision to donate a portion of the proceeds from the sale of his Missing Pieces CD to organizations that can assist families in affording the treatment needed to help their autistic children succeed.  As the song â€œMissing Piecesâ€ is being played more and more, Leland is frequently asked to perform at autism benefits across the country.  Parents of autistic children who have heard his song are sharing his enthusiasm with other members of their community.  Together, Leland and his fans are spreading autism awareness across the nation and possibly, the world.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to 15 year old with Early Infantile Autism, Inattentive ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Anxiety Disorder</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to 15 year old with Early Infantile Autism, Inattentive ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Anxiety Disorder</div>'

It\'s amazing how much variance there is with our kids abilities.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ &quot;\'Sometimes,\' said Pooh, \'the smallest things take up the most room in your heart.\'&quot;</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ \'Sometimes,\' said Pooh, \'the smallest things take up the most room in your heart.\'</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">The difference is the focus on the behavior viewed as the goal in and of itself vs. the focus on the internal developmental or cognitive state.  If all you focus on is the behavior that is demonstrated with no interest in why, then it\'s accurate a Floortime program will drive you crazy.  But the premise of taking a developmental approach such as Floortime (it\'s not my favorite developmental approach, tbqh) is that if you assist them along the developmental path they missed due to the blinders of autism getting in the way, then a lot of the so-called \"behaviors\" will rectify themselves... and those that linger out of habit will be more willingly redirected, because you\'ve reduced whatever was creating the need for them in the first place.      But I also now think \"behavior\" is a very small part of autism.  A symptom rather than the entirety of it.      Personally?  I think the ideal program incorporates it all, adjusting day by day if not more often depending upon the needs of the child at whatever moment.  All approaches are valid for different children, and a combination is probably best for addressing the whole child.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">This invitation was originally posted on 7th December 2009 with the cut off date of 20th February 2010. I\'d like to now extend the date until the 20th March 2010. Those who are interested in this research after this date, can send an email and I will assess if I have time to collect and analyse the data in time for submission.  Dear Parent/ Guardian,   My name is Amy Dixon I am a 3rd year Psychology and Counselling BA (Hons) studying at the University of Derby, England. As part of my degree course, I am conducting a study into an area of my choice. I am particularly interested in the experiences of parents who have autistic children and how they cope with any difficulties, and am contacting you to invite you to participate in a study of the experience of bringing up a child with autism.   The research I am conducting is an interview using questions that invite you to discuss ways of coping relating to your childâ€™s developmental disorder. If you feel that there are particularly important areas that youâ€™d like to express during the interview then this is entirely appropriate as I am fascinated to hear about your experiences.   Previous research has explored many aspects of bringing up a child with autism. For example studies have identified how a childâ€™s delays or deficits in social development and specific problems in the parentâ€“child relationship can cause distress for mothers and fathers. Research into methods that can be used to help coping, such as the use of positive touch used in daily life provide insight into how the emotional barriers created by autism can be partially overcome.  Despite the difficulties and struggles parents may face, the influence of having an autistic child on family life is also portrayed as a positive life-changing experience and it is the breadth of details of the experience that this study will continue to extend.  This study will add further insight to the current research field, helping to provide further information for parents, researchers and organisational bodies. Research studies, such as this, are integral to the improvement of existing support services as they contribute further detail into the life experiences of children, families and parents experiences of living with autism.   Participating in this research will allow you to air all the personal views you hold regarding the difficulties, the experience of raising your child and all the coping methods you personally find useful. This is an opportunity to express all of the opinions you have formed and to explore the coping skills you have developed. Such self reflection may benefit you as your acknowledge all the areas you deal with, but also, when the works published, your experiences may help inform other parents. Your experiences may provide guidance or inspire other parents and prompt reflection onto their own ways of coping and dealing with any difficulties they face.   The research will be conducted via email and will involve participants responding to questions within a week of them being sent out, as this allows me time to transcribe data.   Participation is entirely voluntary and I would be very grateful to anyone who is willing to help me investigate this area further.   The interview data will be written up and analysed. Analysis will be conducted using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis which is a method that acknowledges the importance of the ways in which people explain their experiences.   Participants who take part will have their data altered so that no original names are used and thus no participants will be identifiable when the data is published after analysis. I, my supervisor and the marker of research are the only individuals who will see the raw data of the experiment, which is the data before the process of anonymising the data has occurred.   If participants wish to withdraw their data during or after the experiment they can do so using the unique alpha-numerical code created by combining:  Your motherâ€™s maiden name, Eg. Smith  and     the last three digits of your mobile telephone NUMBER, 567  So your code would be Smith567   This can later be used to identify their data, allowing for data to be correctly withdrawn if this is requested by the participants.  Participants who wish to withdraw their data after it has been collected in may do so up until the 20th March 2010 by contacting <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:a.dixon1@unimail.derby.ac.uk\">a.dixon1@unimail.derby.ac.uk</a><!-- e -->   Thank you for taking the time to read this and those who are interested can sign up via emailing <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:a.dixon1@unimail.derby.ac.uk\">a.dixon1@unimail.derby.ac.uk</a><!-- e -->.

I am impressed that you really went all the way and had the courage to hold your ground even though you knew that it was unlikely anyone would agree with your choices. I am also so happy that your consultant was open to trying it.     As for the red faced therapist - supervisor lady <img src=\"http://www.planetsmilies.com/smilies/mad/mad0002.gif\" alt=\"Image\" /> I really, really don\'t get this. Why, this fight to be right??? This is your child and they are supposed to be helping you and your child. You are saying that things are not working, that you are concerned for your son. I feel like if I was the therapist and I thought you were dead wrong, I still wouldn\'t be angry. I\'d be thinking this woman tried our way - she\'s concerned for her son and she wants to try something different - I don\'t think it will work but let\'s try because ultimately this woman needs to know she tried everything she could to see that her son is happy and feels safe and secure. WTF, why should that make her angry? Did she invent ABA that she has such a personal stake in it?    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Yesterday the woman who is also a supervisor but is on our case as a therapist stated she does not feel DS is using stim as any sort of outlet for anxiety.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Honestly, I think \"G\" would have been put in the thinking chair or something because we don\'t push, especially a NT child.  Then, I would have allowed your DS to sit in the chair and when \"G\" was out of time out, I would have made him ask your DS if he could sit with him.  If G obvioulsy wasn\'t going to do that, I would have had your DS get up and offer him a \"turn\" on the chair, but G needed a consequence.  I think you missed that because you wanted the social lesson but your ds would have learned from that too, I believe.  I think he could have learned a little respect from that.    I am no expert obviously and am not telling you YOU did anything wrong.  That\'s just my take when reading it.  I wasn\'t there and don\'t know what I would have truely \"done\".  Just another perspective.  If my NT 3yr. old ds pushed a little boy out of the chair that was offering to share wiht him, he\'d go to time out.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Lisa</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Lisa</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thanks for the movie review...I\'ll have to wait for the DVD.

Then when she finally gets here, (4 hours late, somehow 1pm turned into 5pm!!!) she has the nerve to hand me some money and says, \"Can you pick up something for the kids while you\'re out, I don\'t want to get them the wrong thing?\"   So my shopping expedition turned into one for her   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x\" title=\"Mad\" />     Since she was so late, I only had about about 2 hours and at  1 store it took me that long to stand in line practically.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi LM- We\'ve done it about 2 months.  He is just nearing his 20th dive.  We haven\'t been very aggressive with it...just about 3 hour long sessions a week.  It\'s mHBOT.  But I definitely notice the articulation has drastically improved.  Again, I can\'t confirm it\'s the HBOT but it correlates with when we are doing it.  Also the LONG sentences have just materialized in the past month.  I\'ve also seen some negatives but not sure what that\'s from.  Everyone is saying allergy season is bad so I\'m getting a lot of \"no\'s\" lately from him and sometimes he is nasty which is unlike him.  It\'s so tricky to figure out what is helping (or not).  I\'m really not doing that much in the way of biomed so mHBOT was the really \'big\' thing we are doing.  (also doing mb12 for like 4 1/2 months...also the basic supplementation).  I just got LL and wanted to do that but AJ\'s pH is pretty decent.  I\'ve only been doing one drop in the a.m.  That was very recent though (I\'d say just last week).  The longer sentences and stuff started before that.  Definitely more spontaneous language has been noted.  Not too much in the way of pretend play which is what I was hoping to get from mHBOT ...  Everyone seems to be doing the hard chamber now...maybe that gives more of an effect?</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">toddlers are cute in the things they say not knowing the meaning and autistic kids are no different. when i was about 2 my mom said i saw an old man in the store and quite loudly announced, he is really old mom he\'s going to die isnt he. (yes i talked in full sentences at 1 year old i guess genetics showed early there i love to talk.) so absolutly embarassed beyond belief she had to have the appropriate vs. inappropriate talk with me though i didnt get it at 2, who would? i had a few more moments so im told.   i kinda wish my son would blurt something like this out as then i would have a better understanding of what he is thinking about. right now only talks to get needs met and just started showing intrest in showing things and commenting on things in books but only one word. its a start and i look forward to embarassing moments to come. my other son doesnt understand how to say i like something more than something or someone else and often will out right tell people i like so and so not you when he really means ive taken a new intrest in this person and i like them too in a different way than you and i like you in such and such way. but it comes across as rude or mean or insensitive, hard to keep freinds as they then think he no longer likes them. so black and white in his thinking or right and wrong no in betweens allowed either. he also likes to tease on which is your favorite sports teams and purposely say he likes an opposing team all to get your reaction even though he may like the same team too. we call him a ship jumper changing coats so often but i love his thinking pattern b/c in todays teachings there is no absolute truth, things can be manipulated to have the outcome be what you want it to be or in your view point so in this way he is old fashioned!!! there is absolute truth its either this way or that not in the middle or sorta, though recently he has added to his phrases i kinda like your team etc. better awareness that it may hurt feelings to be so blunt. we are really having trouble with the hidden social meanings of things like girls bug you b/c they like you, how could that possibly make sense? so much to go through, all in good time i say.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Lisalynn  keeping hope and faith through it all.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Lisalynn  keeping hope and faith through it all.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Well, this forum is going to give you a biased sample of answers because (no offense to anyone here) most of the members here are either parents of autistic children or autistic themselves, thus no parent is going to risk bashing his/her child, and many autistic people are asking the exact same question you are.    It has been a personal mission of mine for quite some time to uncover as much of this mystery as possible. I have been carefully studying what it is about me that seems to turn many people away and from what I can tell, there seem to be about four very complex issues at play. Here is what I have uncovered so far.    a) Perceived rudeness/insensitivity: NTs tend to be vain and sensitive as a whole, and thus their language reflects it, resulting in euphemisms and understood meanings that we (autistics) are often blind to. We tend to speak very matter-of-factly, not intending any ill will, but not following the euphemism game ether. Thus NTs will read into our words what they would expect to read into another NT\'s words, causing a misunderstanding. They consider us callous, uncaring, or snotty at first glance, and often a glance is all we get.    b) Perceived odd or inappropriate behavior: Some of the body language we exhibit reflects our lack of connectivity with the outside world, from staring to unusual pastimes to odd forms of self stimulation. People in general tend to be either uncomfortable or curious with what they do not understand. So when they encounter it, they will immediately try to either avoid it or explain it. Either way can spell trouble, because when someone does not understand the nature of autism, they do not attribute it to our behavior. However, they need an explanation to put their mind to rest, so they go on what they do know as a means of fabricating an explanation. As a result, an autistic person can quickly get negative reputations that he or she neither deserves, nor is even aware of.    c) Perceived inflexibility: Autistic people, even those who are able to function in society, need time to plan things in their head. I, for example, have a massive mental database of \"if-then\" scenarios regarding not only words, but physical actions as well. Thus I work better if I can anticipate the situation and have a dozen or so of these scenarios plotted out ahead of time, affording me the 30-to-60-second buffer zone I need without making it visible to the people who I\'m talking to. The only problem with that is that NTs tend to be spontaneous and change plans at the drop of a hat. When this happens, my \"buffer zone\" becomes visible to others because I have to reprogram myself to follow a different sequence of \"if-thens.\" Even if it only takes 10 seconds or less, the short hesitation and confusion appears as a non-compliance, so when I\'m finally ready and say \"okay\" it is perceived as sarcasm (going back to the euphemism issue in part A). Even though I truly mean I\'m OK with the plan now, my body language has told them that I\'m actually upset even though I am saying it\'s OK, which in fact is a regular deceptive practice among NTs, hence the convincing nature of the body language. This causes people who are not recognized as autistic to be perceived as rigid, inflexible, difficult to get along with, and sometimes, even combative. As for those who are recognized as autistic, it results in the myth that autistic people are intolerant of change and can\'t deviate from their routine. In actuality they can deal with change, they simply need the proper preparation time in order to make the transition smoothly.    d) Perceived lack of intelligence/lack of functionality: A common misconception about autistic people is that they are, by definition, retarded or at best, below average intelligence. While this is, of course, is not necessarily the case, it\'s not been easy to bust the myth (OK I\'m calling MythBusters now!  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /> ). Thus when it becomes known that a person has autism or that they are a little different or eccentric, people tend to assume that the person is incapable of doing random things. This can be because they do not think the person is smart enough, or it can be, as a result of part C, they do not think the person is willing. And people, in general, often do not desire what they can\'t gain benefit from, so lack of functionality, as well as insensitivity, inappropriate behavior, and inflexibility, becomes an undesirable trait -- even if it is falsely judged.    These four categories go much, much deeper than what I have summarised here, but I didn\'t want to write a novel right here and now.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" />  (And I didn\'t even mention the effects of being \"out of the clique\" as a result of placing value in different areas, which is especially demeaning in younger people.) Nonetheless, these are the main players, best I can figure so far, but unfortunately each one is so complex and multifaceted that you could go on all day about any one of them.    Hopefully, though, these summaries will be enough to give you a general idea of where the roots of the problem lie. And as David mentined, it seems for the most part that NTs, or rather the society they have created, is solely what makes autism a \"disorder.\" Thus I\'m afraid that the treatment may have to come not just from trying to make autistics more like NTs, but also from better educating NTs on what exactly it is that they are seeing, and how to better read it.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ ~Nick    If it wasn\'t for sexual harassment in the workplace....

Her real treatment hasn\'t even begun yet , but we are very confident she will respond well . We so far have told only the people closest to us , and plan on keeping it this way. We are not planning on keeping it a secret , but at the same time we are not broadcasting it. I may be wrong but my instincts tell me it is on a need to know basis.  I don,t think as parents we should be focusing on the label , instead focus on treatment.     What if in the next 2 years she doesn\'t show any ASD symptoms , I do not what her to be labeled by ignorant society. I know we have our dx, but i am trying not to focus on the label. I try not to think of her as autistic . To me she is just a pretty little girl that  needs more time to learn things . I think with the proper treatment even this will change.     Good luck to you and i know things will only get better for us all.</div>'

Then, he runs and hides when I yell at him........    And don\'t get me started on MIL\'s  I\'m SURE I have EVERYONE on this board beat when it comes to this subject.   My last conversation with mine, she hung up on me and then called back to tell my husband she was going to call the police on me and have me arrested for \"harassment.\"    (I called to make sure she was ok since I know one of her neighbors and they called and told me an ambulance had been down by her house that morning.  They weren\'t sure if it was her house or not but close so I called.........won\'t do that again.)      She NEVER visits Luke and Jessica so my mom is they\'re only grandparent. But she does beg my husband for pictures and I\'m thinking, why bother to ask when you\'re not a part of their life?

' <div class=\"postbody\">re: stims    Ds used to be a stim-machine around the ages of 3-4, now I think perseverations (galore) better describe him- i.e. not outward stims (physical), but certain repetitive activities (like imitating, humming, singing etc) have replaced them (maybe vocal stims?).  I think he needs the stims. I am no longer in the phase where I wanted to suppress each one of them. For whatever reason his nervous system needs this and I\'m OK with that. I am trying to teach him when/where it is inappropriate to stim and to maybe \"save\" it for the privacy of his own room. Maybe that\'s as unreasonable an expectation as suppressing the stims altogether, I don\'t know, but I think it\'s worth a shot since he is still young and doesn\'t seem to be made uncomfortable by not stimming .   When my son checks out, he doesn\'t seem to register much of what is being said to him, his stimming doesn\'t seem a way of better perceiving his environment, rather a means of avoiding it. Of course, I am not generalizing anything, that\'s just my observation about him in particular.   On a much smaller scale- I am a major hair-twirler (which is why I can\'t cut my hair short, I would miss it too much). Especially when I\'m stressed, or tired, or alone etc- but even if I felt like it , I would never   do that in a meeting for example. I don\'t want to teach ds not to stim, but to understand that at times this can be inappropriate (like in class when everyone else is working), or bothersome (like when his little sister is sleeping), or interfering with other things (like when we are doing homework). So he can ask for a stim break - he has that option (and never uses it) or just save it for later.   It also dawned on me that sometimes ds uses his stims as a means of controlling the interaction, steering it to something he is having mastership of, avoiding tasks etc. If I think that\'s the case I just completely ignore them, and he usually stops.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Ok, first, Mom to Matthew.... I LOVE the answer your son came up with.  I would want to go home too.    Jeffrey\'s mom....My daughter did not do well on the IQ test in kindergarten.  Her score was 69 \"with caution\" which is written on her IEP.  The reason being, she answered some questions above what she should have known, but missed answers she SHOULD have known.  That score affected me for about a week, but when I explained to the school psychiatrist that my daughter had a \"performance deficit\", she really, truly understood what that meant, therefore \"with caution\" was added because the test truly couldn\'t measure her intelligence.    I personally think IQ tests suck!  (no bitterness, huh?) How would some of the \"book smart\" people perform on a social IQ test, if there was one?      We need all types of people in this world from the book smart, to the social smart, to the athletic smart, and the list goes on and on.      DO NOT let this score get to you.  He is still the same little boy he was before the test, and you KNOW how far he has come!  And think about it....as adults, we are not on the same level either.  We all have our special gifts to this world, and a high or low score IQ test means nothing in the end.      I\'m sure today he will do something to make your heart smile and remind you that you are ok.    I hope I helped you.  Dee\'s mom</div>'

We also discouraged it since it interfered with his life in many ways (hard to learn and function properly when he\'s hypnotized by a fan). It seemed the more he watched a fan, the more he was \"stuck\" on them, almost like an addiction. We left fans off whenever possible, and tried to always have something on hand that we knew he had a strong interest in (a little toy etc) to divert his attention in case we ended up in a place with a fan. He did cycle through other obsessions, but we tried to direct him to things that were more socially appropriate and less disrupritive to learning and life.  As for the fear, is it from the noise or from the sight of the fan? If it\'s just the idea of the fan, and the noise doesn\'t bother him, perhaps find a little toy fan and introduce it to him in increasing increments of time in a playful manner, or something along these lines to show him that fans won\'t hurt him. Try to make fans \"funny\" or non-threatening in some playful manner - show him (from a distance) how the wind makes things fly across the room, or tie a streamer to a box fan....etc. (just some brainstorming, I hope I\'m making sense  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />  )   I hope this helps!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ mibrielle</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ mibrielle</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">having experience in both aba and vb or as some say vba what you are talking about is clearly the difference between the two. in vb you(the aide or parent if you implement sameness at home) are the giver and the positive person in the childs life who is rewarding their every attempt to comply/communicate etc. whatever the goal is. in aba you are the taker awayer(i know not a real word) their model; if you dont do something you wont get your reward. laws of natural behaviors are easy... you want to do things when you are rewarded for them and you want to do things if you know you are going to be rewaded but FIRST the trust has to be there that you know the giver is going to reward. my behaviorist always tells people... you wouldnt work without getting a paycheck(unless you volunteer and that is by choice) and also you wouldnt work and then wait 3 months to get paid. asd children are smart and figure out this system pretty quickly. my child has not tried to task avoid for over two years, since converting and understanding this way, not saying he likes everything he has to do but he will do the task. another big difference is his mind is not so upset about trying to get out of it he is actually concentrating on the task not thinking how quickly he can do it to get it over with, or even more concerning to a parent is he is no longer thinking how long will they force/restrain me to sit here and do this skill regardless of circumstance ie. your example of having to to the bathroom, needing a sensory break, any other situation . he had gone through many programs/tasks in his prior aba with them checking off acheived and in reality he was only doing it not LEARNING it. we had to back track and redo almost everything from his aba programs. i was so naive when we moved cities i didnt even know their was a difference in styles and luckily when we moved back we were able to hook up with our original vb provider. hence we have a happier, more social(b/c this aide who is spending 40 or so hours a week is also molding your childs feelings about relating to people by example and their actions, another scary thought.) loving school and loving therapy child. and in the end isnt this what we want??? along with the learning and becoming the most they can be!!! i should have went on mothers instincts when the first day we had aba, wasnt even therapy just a get to know us, the aide and provider gave him a toy and not even two minutes later without warning took it away. well i asked why did you do that and they said to push him and test him. he of course any 3 yr old would be, was upset. just didnt make sense to me to do that and the year continued on that note i just wasnt educated enough to know better and luckily we relocated back to our original city and vb programming. im not knocking aba just MY experience with it. also it does not mesh with my family values and style idont beleive in eat everything on your plate or no dessert, clean your room or you lose tv privledges etc. etc. all examples of being a taker awayer. so just in this way it was not a fit for us and im sure others think aba is great and works for their kids though it also probably depends a lot on personality too;layed back passive compared to youngest sibling feisty and strong willed. just my 2 cents and agreement with the poision tree/fruit theory.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Lisalynn  keeping hope and faith through it all.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Lisalynn  keeping hope and faith through it all.</div>'

I think some professionals think they can give you a plan and you will go away and use it forever unchanged. We have to meet at least once a month with our behavior expert to change and update the plan.

Consistency is the hardest thing, since her dad and I have different styles and tend to interpret a situation differently! We try to figure out ahead of time how we will react to all possible scenarios so we\'re consistent.  Another problem we\'ve encountered is that the person making up the plan really needs to analyze the function of each behavior so that the plan doesn\'t inadvertently reinforce the behavior.

' <div class=\"postbody\">We went through this as well.  My son would literally kick off his shoes (yes they\'d go airborne) as soon as we walked into the school building.  We would put them back on and the aid constantly put them back on, eventually we just put him in slipper socks upon arrival at school.  Slippers work well too.  It is just a sensory thing, seeking input on the soles and the toes.  The feet take in input very much the same way that our hands do, so for our tactile kids feet crave touch just like their little hands do.      Some sensory activities will help meet that need.      Walk barefoot through shoe boxes set up with different textures.... cotton, corn kernnels, a big lined with sandpaper, bubble wrap.... get creative.    Foot massages  Foot spas (I got mine for $18 at Walmart, he LOVES it)  Firm pressure with a soapy rag on the top and bottom of foot  Joint compressions  Shoes weights  Ankle weights  Running  Jumping    Invest in comfy socks, and socks of different textures (like those fuzzy ones).</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Dana</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Dana</div>'

How is Sonrise different from, say, RDI?  They sound very similar at a glance, no?     <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">the 1:1 aspect of child and parent or therapist in a room with no distractions and no pressures allows you to engage fully, with full attention. so for example, potty training - the potty is in the room, child has to pee, its just you, child, potty and diaper and a few reinforcers. </div>  Again, I know virtually nothing of sonrise, but this method for potty training is one that was discussed in a workshop I attended recently through our local CARD, which is largely behavioral.  It would be considered the \"intensive\" approach, which <em>sounds </em>really ugly of course, but the basic plan as I understood it would be very similar, and keeping the child engaged during this time would be of the utmost importance.   Are there other specifics you can share that would make it more distinctly sonrise?  I do realize that many \"brand name\" therapies share things in common and overlap, perhaps this is just one of those instances?</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I was talking to the vice principal of my son\'s private school about homeschooling him.  She is one of S.\'s biggest fans, she suggested we think about a part time option with the school.  Basically, we homeschool and of the curriculum list under say english or music, we list the school\'s name as the place where he will recieve his instruction.  The school has a new and progressive prinicipal and they are restructuring how they do things.  I\'ve found a few private schools around here willing to allow people to do this, at a price of course.  His current private school suggested we try one or two class for first grade, then part time for second and then full time for the next thee years.  We are going to see how it goes.  The vice principal, Sister Joseph, is retiring after 35 years of teaching.  She also pointed out to me that the problem isn\'t always the kid.  She also told me if S.\'s anxiety is only happening at school or more specifically in the class room, that we need to consider what else is contributing to the problem, meaning how his teacher is dealing with his anxiety and his giagantic crush on the teacher\'s aide.  The principal also alluded to the same problem.  Since, S. handle a belt test for his Tae Kwon Do test in room with 30 other kids, 6 instructors and a hundred spectators without any anxiety and tons of focus,  I\'m thinking they may be right.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Rebekah -- I think Mary hit on a great point: \"a teacher who cares and wants to learn is like finding gold!\"     Based on the fact that you are here looking for answers, you\'re already way ahead of many.  I have not yet had the pleasure of dealing with teachers specific to my son\'s needs (he\'s only 2), but over the years of dealing with my daughter\'s teachers (junior in high school now), I have to agree with Mary.  Ultimately, I think the same things that go into making  great \"regular ed\" teachers also apply to special ed teachers -- but perhaps with greater need and potentially making a greater difference.  Showing a genuine interest in our children and valuing our input will go a long way toward building relationships and ultimately helping the children... not to mention that it will probably help you to love your job and maintain your motivation.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /></div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">I was just wondering to see if any one had a child who sailed through the first six months and got to \"speaking\" and numbers and letters in that time</div>  Well, technically, mine did at the end of 6 months speak unprompted in 1-2 words (mostly requests and labels) and had letters/numbers nailed (due to Sesame Street and his hyperlexic tendencies, not because anyone was teaching those). That didn\'t make him less PDD, but it certainly gave him more skills and made our (and his) life a little easier. This has been an ongoing problem of mine (there was an interesting thread about it a while ago, but I don\'t remember how it started)- I see more skills much faster than I see less autism (does this make sense?). I would say he was off to a good start, and has made progress, but he is still PDD. My point is that the first six months may not necessarily be indicative of later progress or functioning. Don\'t know if those who did the ABA studies looked at prognostic information from that end.  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">We have been told by our ABA specialists that our boy is not excelling at his program because we dont have enough therapists or time put into it</div>  At 15-20 hours a week? I don\'t buy it.  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">our ABA people dont want us around during therapy time which is really galling!   I mean, its my child and its my house!! I need to see what they are doing so i can learn to do it myself when they are not here. </div>    It\'s ridiculous for them not to share their methods with you, since any good ABA program has such heavy parental involvment. However, after hearing more about them it makes me wonder if they really have a lot to teach you.    The one thing that made the most difference for my son in the early learner stage, was teaching him to request. This is something that was really stressed by our consultant (it\'s very important in VB), and it went over well with my son who realized that he had to produce \"something\" in order to get what he wants. Sabotaging his environment was necessary at the time, things were out of his reach, in clear plastic bins. He couldn\'t get them unless he came to me and asked for them. At this point , a good consultant should help suggest what exactly you can expect from your child based on his current level. If you ask too much (like a whole word) and he isn\'t yet talking, that will just frustrate him. Sometimes it is easier to start with sign (because it can be prompted). If the child can vocally imitate, then a syllable (sp?) is enough (this is what we did at first), or PECS. Just so they get the idea of communication= a good thing. You don\'t even have to worry about reinforcing because it\'s already built into what they are requesting.     One thing that stuck with me, is reading somewhere (in Gutstein\'s book I think) that children (ANY children) are always capable of just a little more than they are currently doing. It was a Russian psychologist who said that, I don\'t remember his name (starts with a V). It sounds simplistic, but it\'s really brilliant- we just have to know how to scaffold things really carefully for them. With PDD kids, I imagine they just need tons more scaffolding than typical kids - which is what good ABA is supposed to do, break down a skill until it can\'t be broken down any further, right?    Also- do you have the Bumblebee videos? They are great for early language and many ASD kids love them.   Best of luck- a break always sounds good, if not for them, at least for us <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />  Alex\'s mom</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Lee\'s Summit families start autism support group     Group bonds together in time of funding shortfall for special education     By Chase Jordan  Tribune Staff        Sherri Tucker and her family moved to Lee\'s Summit because she believed her son would receive the best education here.     Jacob was diagnosed with autism 11 years ago.  He is now 14 years old.     \"I chose where we moved in Kansas City, solely on my son.  I didn\'t care about location.  I wanted to live where Jacob had the best opportunity,\" Tucker said.  \"We moved here when he was in kindergarten.\"     The family is not pleased with the R-7 School District.     \"We can be living in Raytown or Independence and pay less tax and pay less for the water bill and still not get any worse of an education,\" Tucker said.     In November 1006, Tucker and Debra Shaumeyer created the Lee\'s Summit Autism Support Group.  Shaumeyer is the mother of a 5-year-old autistic son.     \"What we want to do is get the school district to work with us to give the best education they can.  In the sate of Missouri that\'s not an easy thing to do,\" Tucker said.  \"Most of the time we talk about what goes on in the school district.\"     Tucker described Individualized Education Plan meetings, which are attended by seven to 15 school officials.     \"So you sit there and these people tell you that your child is never going to be normal, which is a very hard thing to handle,\" Tucker said.  \"You assume that these people are giving you all the right information and you believe them and you sign on the dotted line. What you never find out is that those people are never going to give you what you need until you\'re smart enough to know what you need and you fight for it.\"     Tucker said Missouri is 48th in the country for special education funding.     \"In the state of Missouri, when your kid gets diagnosed with autism, the doctor ways go forth, you\'re done, and you\'re on your own,\" she said. \"We\'re working on legislative issues and trying to work with the school district.\"     Senator Matt Bartle, of Lee\'s Summit, said Missourians are not interested in raising taxes.  He said Missourians rejected the last seven ballot proposals to raise taxes.  <span style=\"color: blue\">(I\'ve read that there is a surplus.  This issue has nothing to do with raising taxes)</span>     \"We\'re ranked 48 or 49 in a lot of things,\" Bartle said.  \"We\'re a low spending state because we\'re a low taxing state.\"  <span style=\"color: blue\">(I guess its ok to be 48th if you are consistent across the board.)</span>     Bartle said autism is a problem that Missouri is going to have to deal with.  <span style=\"color: blue\">(Sorry to be a burden)</span>     \"Autism is a growing problem in Missouri and in the United States, and it\'s putting a strain on social services and the school system,\" he said.  \"We have to figure out what\'s causing autism.  It\'s a major cost drainer in Medicaid and the education budget.\"  <span style=\"color: blue\">(Good luck with that.  We\'d like to know what is causing it, too.  However, we are sorry that we are a major drainer on your budget.)</span>     According to the Lee\'s Summit group, there are more than 210 students diagnosed with autism in the district.  They believe that the teachers in the district should be trained in autism.     \"A lot of these kids with autism are in special education, so their teacher would be trained in autism,\" Tucker said.  \"But my son is not in special ed, he\'s in regular ed.  So he has seven teachers everyday that don\'t have a clue and they\'re going to educate my son.\"     Tucker said there have been times when her son became sick or had \"meltdowns\" because of the different expectations of teachers.     Jerry Keimig, R-7 director of special services, said that it is not possible to train every teacher in the district.     \"We provide the most comprehensive autism training than any other school district that I\'m aware of,\" Keimig said.  \"It\'s not feasible to train every teacher for every disorder.  There are 50 to 60 different medical or emotional diagnoses.\"  <span style=\"color: blue\">(I\'m pretty sure that the other 49 to 59 don\'t affect 1 in 94 boys.  The district\'s program only trains special education teachers.  Not paras or regular ed teachers.  They also let folks from other districts come in and they charge a fee for that.  We have asked that they video tape the workshop and make it available to regular ed teachers.  We have asked that they train one teacher at each grade level and have her teach our kids.  They could afford an administrative building that was millions of dollars, but they can\'t afford to help our kids.)</span>     The district hosted a four-day workshop in June.     \"We try to make autism a priority.  I don\'t know any other disability that we do four-day workshops on,\" Keimig said.     Stacey Martin, autism specialist, said about 75 people participated in the workshop. <span style=\"color: blue\">(I would say that at least half of those were not employees of the district.  Five or six were members of our group)</span>     \"We try to target those teachers who have not had training before.  We do our very best to make sure they have the training they need to meet the needs of students,\" Martin said.  \"We are always looking for new things to learn about autism. We\'re always eager to help these kids.\"     Superintendent Dr. David McGehee said it would be difficult to make every teacher an expert, but believes they should have some basic knowledge of autism if they are teaching a diagnosed child.  <span style=\"color: blue\">(They do not do this.  I\'m not asking for them to be an expert.  But, they are ought to know the basics and this district refuses to do that.)</span>     \"There are opportunities for the teachers to be trained,\" McGehee said.  \"You can\'t deal with all students the same because they have different needs.  It\'s a challenge in today\'s education system.\"  <span style=\"color: blue\">(This is simply not true, unless the teachers train on their own time.  Dr. McGehee also said that \" Although repeatedly recognized for our students\' outstanding scores on the Missouri Assessment Program tests, our district has still been placed in the \"District Improvement Level 1\" category based on the scores of a very small number of students in two sub-groups. These students were in the sub-groups of special-education students and \"English language learners\" (students who do not speak English as their first language). Although we do single out these two sub-groups as part of this explanation, I want to make it clear that we are proud of these students and their efforts and believe that they did their best on the state-wide tests, demonstrating improvement in a comparison of 2006 and 2007 test scores. The students in both categories were required to meet the same high standard as regular-education students with no modification of the MAP communication arts tests that would take the students\' disabilities and special language challenges into account. The scores of students in these two sub-groups are the sole reason our district was designated in this category. A misleading aspect of this legislation is that only districts with a large enough sub-group population can be identified, thus holding harmless smaller districts with similar or lower levels of achievement.\")</span>    McGehee said the support group does a good job dealing with autism.    \"I appreciate Mrs. Tucker\'s approach in the group.  I don\'t look at them as antagonist or anything because we need to find a common ground,\" McGehee said.  \"Sometimes people perceive it as a fight.  I perceive it as continuing dialog.\"  (<span style=\"color: blue\">When your child\'s future is at stake, continuing dialog isn\'t enough. If he doesn\'t see us as antagonist, why did he bring it up?)</span>    Tucker said she wants to work with the school district to improve in this area.    \"I don\'t want to be negative, but I want to let people know there\'re other people with the same issues,\" Tucker said.  \"I want people to know that we need to progress in this area.\"</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to 15 year old with Early Infantile Autism, Inattentive ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Anxiety Disorder</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to 15 year old with Early Infantile Autism, Inattentive ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Anxiety Disorder</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Jujomom,    Not much time to post, but I wanted to pass along the names of a couple of my favourite books:  For a good ABA read, check out \"Let Me Hear Your Voice\" by Catherine Maurice and \"Overcoming Autism\" by Lynnn Koegel and Claire Lazebnik.  \"Facing Autism\" by Lynn Hamilton is good too.  It gives a great overview of all the treatment options including ABA and biomedical.  Incidentally, my son was three years at diagnosis and he did not start ABA until he was three years and eight months.  He is certainly not \"indistinguishable\", but he has made much progress.  It is wonderful that your son is so young and that he already has some words in place.  I bet he moves really quickly when you get things going.  My doctor\'s son was also not diagnosed until age three (and she is a pediatrician) so give yourself a pat on the back for getting the early diagnosis.  Regarding ABA providers, my best advice is to trust your instincts.  Look at the qualifications of course, but go with your gut feelings.  My son was in a government run ABA program (supervised by a PHD psychologist) and it was a nightmare.  I could feel that it was a bad fit from the first day.   I ended up removing him from the program and hiring a lady who had almost no credentials, but she just seemed to have better instincts when it came to addressing his individual strengths and deficits.   Educate yourself quickly - you will be in a much better position to judge who is effective and who is not.        Brandon\'s mom - it certainly sounds like Aspergers to me.  I hope you can get an appropriate evaluation completed soon.  I know that a lot of Asperger kids slip through the cracks when they are young.  The ones that are identified early are usually the ones with a ton of behaviours.  My co-workers grandson was just diagnosed in fifth grade.  Incidentally, he has always identified cars by their make and model as well (i.e. there is a red chevrolet or there is a blue ford).  When my son was assessed for autism, the psychologist actually asked if he ever talked about cars this way.  It was a question on the assessment.  I remember thinking \"what a strange thing to ask\".  Now I know better.    Best of luck to you    Just a mom</div>'

I\'ll let you know how the transitioning goes over the next year or so because Gracie should be transitioning over to regular school.    A lot of different factors to consider though, as you probably already know.  A change in towns can sometimes make a big difference.  You can even find out about new programs.   I dunno, I guess I just don\'t feel completely comfortable trying to give advice about districts down here when all I know is my situation and my individual district.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #400080\">Bill</span> <span style=\"color: #FF8000\">Aly 16;Dillan 14;Jason 11 Liv 8 ASD Grace 6 PDD</span> <span style=\"color: #FF0000\">and Linda</span></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Bill</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">When my NT son was three, I think we actually threw cheerios in the toilet to have him aim at them.  He thought that was fun.  Then with my ASD daughter, I just put her in underwear and washed a lot.  I would put her in front of the TV on the potty chair and IF she went, I made a big deal.  Eventually she got the pee pee thing, but the poops took a lot longer.  I read a book on teaching your special needs child how to go, and one thing that really helped..... I would put her in the bathroom by herself at a time when she usually had to go, then leave her alone and watch thru the keyhole.  I kept telling her what a good job she was doing just sitting there.  That was the key.  Just to sit still long enough to be in there.  Anyway, just kept praising her and kept her in their at 15 min. intervals.  Even if she didn\'t go, I praised her, but eventually she went after a few days of it.  She always held her poop in, so it was tough for a long time.  At about kindergarten, it got better, but I would have to catch her in the act and then tell her to go to the bathroom.    In first grade she finally got it.  So see, for us it took awhile and I didn\'t think we\'d ever get there, but we did.  Good luck!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">For observing: Is the layout of the room such that it would be possible to observe without being seen? If not, maybe use a video monitor (even like a baby monitor) to observe without your child being able to see you. Maybe they\'d keep it set up, so you could drop in to check up from time to time. Other parents might like this as well (though the teachers might not). Some schools have full time online cameras for parents, so it\'s not that far out in left field for them to do.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ mibrielle</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ mibrielle</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">You\'re welcome, Gabesmom.  Glad your trip went well.    As you probably already know, RDI is much more than redirecting problem behaviors.  The more our kids (or anyone, for that matter) can find comfort and security in trusted people, the less they need ritual behaviors and things.  The more you can do to help your child know how to \"read\" comfort and security in you (or any trusted adult,) the less need he has for rituals.       I truly believe that ASD kids can learn perfectly well how to read people, they just need to be taken through all of the steps.  In my own experience, I see that this process is bringing more joy and peace to my own child.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Fred, 7, NT  Barney, 5, autism</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Fred, 7, NT  Barney, 5, autism</div>'

I think you are proving to us that RDI works and that Gutstein is correct- his method can remediate autism (or at least parts of it).

' <div class=\"postbody\">I don\'t think that anyone on this forum means to degrade anyone for not using biomedical treatments.  All of us have different treatments that we use.  Most of us do use a combination.  David Kirby is a hero to some of us (including myself) along with all the DAN! doctors and researchers.  I\'m sorry if it seems that we constantly talk about biomedical treatments but for some of us this is what works for our children.  My child IS recovering and I believe it is because of heavy metals being pulled out of his system.  I don\'t feel that promoting David Kirby\'s book is any type of a publicity stunt.  To me and many others it is a way of getting people to simply ask more questions about why autism is skyrocketing.  A lot of spelling errors on this forum are simply due to typing errors.  I myself tend to have run on sentences and don\'t correct them because I just don\'t have the time.  I hope that we all can start working together and please don\'t feel discouraged that there are so many biomed. posts.

' <div class=\"postbody\">ETA: Just saw where you said that your DS doesn\'t really stim - just ignore that first paragraph if it doesn\'t apply.  Figured I\'d leave it in just in case.  I second the vote to join in with some of his stims.  It really can be very beneficial for him, and if that\'s what he enjoys, then you are playing with him.  I got very caught up for a long time with the idea that DS\'s play had to look NT in order to be fun and beneficial.  Definitely not true.  My DS loves it when we join in with what makes him happy, and doing that has really helped draw him out of himself.  The diet and biomed made him aware of the world around him, but he had no idea what to do about it.  We had to meet him on his level to get him playing with us, and it didn\'t take long for him to get back to a point where he\'d rather play with us than without us.  Even now, we still do a lot of this.  I must have hundreds of scenes from DS\'s favorite shows committed to memory so that I can script along with him.  His first attempts at conversation were actually us scripting scenes from Dragon Tales!  Other things that have been good for us - lots of physical play.  This doesn\'t always mean outdoor play.  We live in an area that has poor air quality warnings fairly often during the summer, so it keeps us indoors a lot.  Some of the things that we do are simple tickle fights (he\'s actually starting to tickle me!), red light/green light (or stop/go), imitating animals (crawling, slithering, hopping, barking, meowing, etc. This helps pretend play too), and building forts.  Sensory play is great, and you can easily make it interactive by taking turns, working together, etc.  DS loves his rice and beans pit, which is just a plastic storage container full of dry rice and beans.  He\'s also very into gluten-free play doh, bubbles, feathers, and rolling around on his bean bag.  We\'ve even &quot;painted&quot; the walls of the hallway with shaving cream - the only way I could get him to touch it!  We\'re lucky enough to have a sensory room now too, but before we had to get much more creative.  A modified follow the leader has also been great for us.  DS, DH, and I stand in a circle and take turns telling each other what to do.  It\'s just simple things like touch your head/ears/nose, hop on one foot, run in place, etc.  At first, it was just DH and I giving directions; early on, one of us often had to physically guide DS through the motions.  Now, DS will actually ask to play it and loves to give commands; he gets a kick out of wearing DH and I out with the running in place.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to one 4-yr-old boy, dx w/Asperger\'s</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to one 4-yr-old boy, dx w/Asperger\'s</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">From what I understand, they give the PDD dx when the child shows some good social behaviors. If the child does is not attached to anyone, including parents, autism is the dx. If child shows attatchment to someone (most likely a parent) it\'s called PDD.     I think the PDD term is so unfortunate, because it is very misleading in that it seems that the child isn\'t \"that autistic\". I\'ve seen plenty of children with a PDD dx who are doing good, and plenty who are very low functioning and very autistic. In my opinion, PDD and autism is the same thing, and it is a shame that they use these terms, since it is gives parents the false belief that their child isnt autistic at all, just has a pervasive developmental disorder.     My child is PDD, and the term means nothing to me. He is autistic (actually a better term would be mercury poisoned). I hope this helps.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">My assumption has always been that a pat on the shoulder mimics both what a child has seen others do, and also what has been done to him that he felt soothing.  I thought it did have an empathy piece.  Maybe for NT kids it\'s both?!?  They identify the feeling they have with particular behaviors and then can correctly interpret it in others and act accordingly?      What worries me about this is that \"our\" kids won\'t realize people can be deeply sad unless they are overtly crying.  Nor realize that people can be sad but act happy.  I wish there was somewhere to ask someone with autism this question.  I know gtto prefers her privacy, and rainman is just so cute I hate to annoy him.

One person reports something erroneous, then dozens of other web sites pick it up and pretty soon lots of people think something false is true because, well, it\'s all over the internet!   I don\'t think it helps the cause of autism to have serial killers and Hitler called autistic on the internet when those people have not been diagnosed with autism.   There are examples of very accomplished individuals who have been verifiably diagnosed with autism or Asperger\'s such as Dr. Temple Grandin, Dr. Stephen Shore and Donna Williams.</div>    I agree that it is hard to diagnose people who are no longer with us. But Autism experts do say Albert Einstein had a lot of autistic traits and, if he was living today, could be diagnosed with High Functioning Autism. Everybody who knows a little bit about Albert Einstein knows he could not talk until he was 4 years old! That\'s common in autism. And when he did start talking, he spoke only in echolalia until he was 7. And Dr Temple Grandin actually knows some of Albert\'s relatives and says there is a high rate of autism, dyslexia and a couple of other problems in Albert Einsteins family that is still living. You should watch the video on youtube called Einstein: the Autism Connection. It may make you think.    Jessica</div>'

We just got back from Austin today and the Dr. didn\'t put a diagnosis on it.  He said he truly thinks our son is extremely gifted and highly intelligent, and may display some signs of some potentially obsessive compulsive type behavior.   He said he is definitely not on the autism spectrum.  He called what we described in our sons \"body movements\" as ticks....and said it could get better or could get worse before it gets better...or could get worse and not better.  He said by puberty, we should see a definite difference either way.  I would like to know more about your son\'s movements....or somehow see.  I have a few still pics of our son...I would like to trade some pics. with you sometime to see what you think.  I\'ve never seen another child do this sort of thing.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Sorry to pipe in late on this but here is some info about weighted blankets. Weighted blankets are thought to help because deep pressure stimulation supplied by the weight in blanket releases a chemical in the brain, which naturally calms.  You can buy them but they can be expensive. Here is a link on how to make your own, however I would stuff it with poly pellets instead of old clothes. Poly-Pellets are a polypropylene product.   They are safe, machine washable and dryable, proven highly effective in applying deep pressure, hypoallergenic,  recommended and used by professionals as a superior weighting material. They sell them in fabric and craft stores such as Michael\'s.     <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://4h.missouri.edu/events/fashionrevue/blanket.pdf\">http://4h.missouri.edu/events/fashionrevue/blanket.pdf</a><!-- m -->    It is very important to consider some major points when purchasing or making a weighted blanket so that it will work properly for the user.     Major points to Consider    1. Goal to accomplish: Is the blanket to be used as a calming tool , for sleep or both.    2. What Is The Correct Size    3. What Is The Correct Weight    4. What Is The Correct Fabric      In deciding what to purchase the first thing to determine is what goal you want to accomplish with your weighted blanket.    If you need a blanket to be used as a calming tool in the car, watching TV, at school, in church, etc. The appropriate size would be a Lap blanket (34\" x 43\")or a Wrap blanket (43\" x 52\").    If you need a blanket for better sleep, the size you choose will depend on the height of the person using the blanket and /or the bed size. It is recommended that a weighted sleep blanket be made to  fit on the top of the mattress  and not hang over the sides of the bed, for smaller children.  Most teens and adults find that a full or queen size blanket is the most comfortable size for both sleep and as a calming tool. Also, in most cases, a  sleep blanket should always have the weights evenly distributed and NOT concentrated in one area.      A child under 40\" in height can use a Wrap blanket (43\" x 52) or a Crib/Toddler Blanket (36\" x 52\") for sleep. Once a height of 40\" in height is reached, a Twin size (43\" x 75)should be considered to give the young user plenty of growing room. Full size (54\" x 75\"), Queen Size (60\" x 80\"), are both  popular choices for teens, young adults and older adults.    CORRECT WEIGHT    Research shows the industry standard formula that most OT\'s or Occupational Therapists use to determine the starting weight for a blanket is to use 10% of the body weight and add one pound. For example a 100 pound person would start with an 11 pound blanket. This is the starting weight and many personal variables can factor in to that equation, in which the user would like the blanket heavier or lighter. They include, size of blanket and proprioceptive input needs of the user. Do not use a weighted blanket for sleep with a small child (under 40 pounds) or one who is really low tone. If it is too heavy it may affect a child\'s breathing while sleeping.     CORRECT FABRIC       Fabric type is one area that is often overlooked when purchasing a blanket. It is important to choose a blanket that is sensory comfortable to the user, and easily done with so many combinations available . A  cotton/cotton combination is the right choice for those that overheat easily. Many like a cotton/flannel combination, for a softer feel. A cotton /fleece combination makes a very soft blanket however because fleece is polyester and does not breathe as easily as cotton and flannel it would probably be avoided for those that overheat easily. The same holds true for a cotton/poly blend fabric. Satin edging , satin \"taggies\"or a washable satin backing also makes a nice blanket for those that crave a smooth \"cool\" feel.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Laura Mom to: Caitlin age 8 ASD Maegan age 11 NT</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Laura Mom to: Caitlin age 8 ASD Maegan age 11 NT</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">It does really hurt at first I think mostly because our dreams for them have all come crashing down and the sky is no longer the limit, it is now closer to the roof.  But as you learn about interventions and therapies you do start to get some of the dreams back in a more limited sense but they are there.    You so aren\'t alone and if at first an anonymous forum is more comfortable for you start here.  The people here are so great, supportive, and very non judmental.  Please take some time out once in a while to give yourself a break.  Get a trusted friend to watch them and go on a date with hubby, just the two of you this relationship is one of the ones that needs to be carefully nurtured during this time of great stress as we tend to get focused on our child and shut out our hubbies.    Also maybe revitalize an old hobbie something you can do for you from time to time.  One of the things I had to let go some of was how much I cared how my house looked.  Of course he has three sisters that help make the messes but something does have to give from time to time.I\'d rather it be housework than something important.    Sorry if I got preachy it was mostly faults I found in myself that I don\'t want others to have to go through also.  But everyone has their own balance to find, you will find yours.  It may take some time, and during this period cut yourself some slack.  You are more than welcome to rant, rave, cry or vent that\'s why were here.      My son also took a plunge into a large pond while I was watching his baby sister and someone else fished him out and told me off.  This was before we knew what was going on with him and was the first time he\'d done this.  I had no idea.  I was so scared when they told me what he\'d done.  But this helped me know to keep a really close eye on him.  It is exhausting, try to get as much rest as you can.

Today he used 4-5 word spontaneous sentences throughout the day. Not perfectly clear of course, but pretty good. At Aidan\'s six month check at the end of February, he had put 2 words together a few times and could repeat 2 word phrases, and do some carrier - \"I want___\" phrases with prompting. Here\'s some examples from today;  He was sitting in a rice bin with his SLP. He called for my daughter to come in the room. When she came in the room he said, \"Kayley, get in the rice tubby.\" Obviously this was a totally spontaneous word combination and the most words he has ever put together.   Later on the computer I turned down the sound and he said, \"what happened to loud?\" Later when the screen backed up he said, \"what happened, I want to play!\"  He also later said to me, \"Mama move! I want sit in black chair!!!\"  So obviously we are breaking out the champagne happy. Along with this language spurt are play and behavior improvements. My little guy was always happy but lately he has been over the moon kind of happy. Excited to see <em>everyone</em>, always laughing and much more flexible with very , very little frustration.  In fact his new thing is when he doesn\'t want to do something he yells no (in a kind of wimpy way) about 2 times and then he says ,\" Oh alllllllright.\"  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" />   <strong>So of course my thrill is tempered by another part of myself. I am definitely trying to keep myself in check. It is easy, because Aidan is still so young to get overexcited. I actually am in a really good place with Aidan and feel comfortable with his diagnosis. So I feel a little nervous that his really great progress could lead to unrealistic expectations on my part and then a kind of second diagnosis if things didn\'t continue to progress.  So, after a big long winded story, I guess I am looking for input from parents who can put things in perspective. As I think I\'m probably in great need of some. For those of you with verbal older (at least older than Aidan) children, when did they get language, what did that process look like? I feel so hopeful for 2 reasons, first, Aidan is totally using language and word combos that we did not teach him and 2 that his progress in language seems to be pushing all his other areas into more typical behavior. I definitely don\'t want to get carried away. I want some perspective because I feel like misreading Aidan\'s progress now could potentially lead to a \"second diagnosis of sorts.\" </strong> I am good with Aidan being ASD. I don\'t need him to be typical, but I guess I just want to know what typical progress might look like in different ASD children if that makes any sense  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarassed\" />  On a different note, my sweet girl has her kindergarten screening tomorrow. I only remembered this because her school called and left a reminder this afternoon  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarassed\" /> When Kayley was Aidan\'s age, I spent so much time trying to nurture an academic curiosity. After being reminded that she will be screened tomorrow, I realize it has probably been about 6 months since I spent any kind of serious time with her academically  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /> I hope I get better at this and can start balancing things.

I was in the same place you are now just a short time ago. I was so worried that T would never talk at first. Then single words came and I was worried that he wouldn\'t put two words together. Once that happened my next worry was what if he never puts 3 or more words together. Then what if he never speaks in a whole sentence. LOL see the pattern here? Honestly I don\'t know for sure when I stopped worrying about his language developement but I did. Tristan is now conversational with us and all of his teachers and therapists at school. He is also engaging his peers in bits of conversations.     It sounds like Aidan is right on track. I can say that I also noticed that as he acquried more language skills his development overall seems to fall into place as well. Just keep talking to him and expecting responses and they will come....</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed. -Theodore Roosevelt</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed. -Theodore Roosevelt</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">ok, if you want to follow Dr. Neubrander\'s protocol, you would start the shots first for a 5 week trial. His reasoning is the brain is the most important to start functioning. Missed milestones of development take longer to recoup. If the child is a responder, then you are feeding the brain and then the diet and suppliments can be introduced after the trial and allow healing to the other areas of the body that are affected. After all, what are the parents really looking for. Answer: Getting my kid back! Translation: Having them act just like other kids, another words, cognative, social, verbal --- BRAIN STUFF.     Jim is opposite of most DAN docs in starting the MB12 first. Many go with the diet as they feel the gut is central to so much of what happens to our kids and they are very correct. Then they introduce MB12.     Who is to say which is right? I am speaking from a totally biased opinion. I filmed the parents and met many of the kids in Jim\'s patient base. In MY opinion, I would pit the brain vs the gut as to which to start based on Jims 94% and 20% coming off spectrum in 2 years. Again this is MY opinion and I am very biased based on what I see. 3 years ago, I did not even know how to spell autism, much less know anything about it.    Many introduce both the diet and MB12 at the same time. Jim\'s contention is that since 75% respond to the diet and (in his practice) 94% respond to MB12 then what happens if you are part of the 6% or 25%. You see improvement, but is the improvement related to MB12 or diet. You will not be able to tell and thus either prescribe unnecessary shots or restrict a diet when there is no need. So in our humble opinions, NEVER start 2 things at once. You have no baseline to compare.     Rick - Not the doctor but a very opinionated guy on what he thinks should be done.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Our early intervention behavioral programming did the Foxx and Azrin method with my dd before she turned 3.    Basically you give the kid a ton of fluids and put them in underpants (that\'s all, no pants).  In the beginning you check to see if they are dry every 5 minutes (touch them over the underpants down there) and give them praise \'good job you\'re dry\'.  Then take them on the potty every 15 minutes and let them sit there and see if they go (about 5 mins).  If not, go back to playing/whatever and continue to check every 5 minutes with praise.  Continue taking every 15 mins until they make.      If they have an accident you walk them to the potty and say \"potty here\", then pull their underpants up and down (yes, wet underpants up and down feel really gross). Then walk them back to where the accident occured and say \"no potty here\" -then back to the potty, underpants up and down and \"potty here\" - you are supposed to do this 5-6 times.  Your child will likely scream their way through this process.  It is not supposed to be fun.  Once the process is done, change them into new underpants and continue until you have a successful pee pee on the potty.  When that happens you give a reward - my dd LOVED gummy bears.  Give it right after they make (we kept Gummy\'s on the shelf in the BR).  You want to reward to be quick so it is associated with the successful pee pee.      Don\'t worry about #2 at all.   Obviously the deterrent mentioned above would be gross with #2.  We still have #2 accidents, but it is because of GI issues, but other than that she is good on the potty.      We did this once to my daughter and she didn\'t have any more accidents on the 1st day.  She was Potty trained #1 within 3 days.  She is non-verbal so she will hold and when we ask if she has to go, she will go toward the bathroom.      I\'m writing this from memory but I think I got it all.

He was very lucid at that final visit about things that happened in the past, he talked alot about meeting my grandma and about the war, and about his own kids when they were young, Luke wasn\'t even 2 years old at the time and we didn\'t know there was anything wrong with him, he was just kinda quiet, but happy back then.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Well, sorry to hear it, but then again, it\'s far from a death sentence. At least you know and can move on w/ a plan.    You are extremely lucky to find out so early and lucky to have a developmental ped that actually recommended ABA and how much. We did not find out, or at least receive a diagnosis until 4 years.    We started out w/ 10 hrs per week of ABA, then ramped up to about 15 per week. We\'ve never done more than that. I always wanted 20-25 per week, but we just never found the therapists. He seems to progress ok w/ what we have, but we are definitely going to a strong 15-20 per week this fall.     I suppose your first thing is to find an ABA provider, find therapists (or a service that does) and set up an area in your home. Don\'t be nervous - just get to it because the earlier the better.  And don\'t ditch your preschool if you can help it.

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">47, don\'t you think it\'s possible for you to keep your Asperger\'s and still get some very focused education/training about living more independently? Assuming you\'d want that, of course. I see where Susan\'s Hope is going - that being autistic and acquiring many more skills are not mutually exclusive. No one loses attributes when they learn new things. They just add on. My BIL has Asperger\'s and is married and has a house and a successful career. Not that everyone should be him, but my point is that it is certainly possible for him to have his Asperger\'s traits and a lot of \"NT\" skills, as well. I suppose that I, too, don\'t understand why some autistics are averse to learning \"NT\" skills due to the fear of losing their autistic attributes. </div>  Oh, I\'d love to get some education like that. I\'m not at all against learning skills and I really hope that I will eventually be able to have a house and a good career. I totally agree that I wouldn\'t lose attributes if I learned new things. It\'s the thought of somehow having my brain changed from autistic to NT that I\'m against. I don\'t think learning is at all the same as changing the way somebody\'s brain works and who they are.  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">I disagree with former posters who say that there is a limit to how much a person can learn.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Definately go with your gut and call another person to re-evaluate him. Time is so precious. Its possible that you can get a list of early interventionists and hire one privately (based on what state you live in) to come in. If you sit in the session, you can learn from him/her and replicate the activities.    For home, check out Greenspan-Floor Time. He has play techniques that promote engagement. I think that they can be beneficial to any child.  Greenspan promotes \"joining in\" with the child. For example, repeating the sounds that your child makes, or imitating exactly their body movements and actions wiht toys. Another idea is interruption. Example- with a ball ramp toy, put your hand to stop the ball from rolling down the ramp. Wait until your child moves your hand, (or better yet looks in your eyes or makes a vocalization). He also advocates pumping up the expressions and animation in your face and voice.    Best of Luck-Grace</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I have not met any grown up autistic that was \"indistinguishable\". I have met one who is a success story but looks \"different\" anyways, hard to put my finger on it. I think my son will always have issues, and I can\'t see him 100% blending in. I do however strongly hope for independent functioning/ very minimal assistance. He seems bright and connected enough to be able to do that. Who knows what his quality of life will be like? I find it nonproductive to think too far ahead, it invariably makes me depressed, especially since I don\'t really see grandkids in our future.  I can\'t help but secretly wish he had Asperger\'s, because of the much higher cognitive/communication abilities, that seem to ensure a better prognosis. I was surprised when I heard Gutstein\'s bleak statistics, that even among Aspies job retention/independent living /marriage etc are pretty poor, regardless for example of how many graduated from college. A lot of food for thought. To my knowledge, we don\'t yet know how the more recently \"recovered\" kids will fare as adults. I have read that Lovaas\' kids were doing well at follow up, but \"doing well\" is a relative term, and I\'ve also read evidence to suggest that as time goes on, it becomes harder and harder for the autistic kids to hold it together and meet the increasing social demands. That\'s why I would rather not think about it, and just concentrate on the moment. I hear the word \"recovery\" thrown around a lot. It may happen for some kids, but I\'m afraid this is only the tip of the iceberg and most of us need to gear up for the long haul. Otherwise there will be a second wave of grief (the first one after diagnosis, the second when it becomes clear that great improvements don\'t equal recovery- happened to me and to others as well).   I would love to hear from parents whose kids had early intervention and who are now past junior high. For some reason, most boards such as this one are made up of parents with very young children-makes me wonder what happens with the other ones? Acceptance? Serenity? Despair? Wisdom? I think their perspective would be very helpful for us with younger kids.   Alex\'s mom</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I have not posted here in quite a while.  I feel compelled to post due to the fact that we enrolled our daughter, Elizabeth, last fall in a brand new private school in Ann Arbor, Michigan that is tailored to the needs of children on the spectrum.  It is called Veritas Christi High School (veritaschristi.com) and it has made a world of difference for Elizabeth.  She is in 9th grade and is in the PDD-NOS category and is high-functioning.  Her experience has been amazing.  Her grades are way up (math was the bane of her existence but she is now pulling a B+), her confidence is up and she is much more comfortable, at ease and better able to work independently than she did in the public school system with a para-pro and resource room.  There are only 8 students so far at the school (enrollment looks to be doubled for next year to 14-15) and they get the needed one-on-one personal attention by the caring faculty to help them succeed.  For us and our daughter the school has been a God send.  She definitely is a success story.  The school has regular open houses for prospective students and parents to become familiar with the school and what it has to offer.  Currently, there aren\'t open houses scheduled but when they are I will make sure I come back here and alert you of upcoming open houses and events.

Pseudomembranous colitis may clear up spontaneously when the drug is stopped; if it doesn\'t, hospital treatment may be required. If you develop diarrhea, check with your doctor immediately.   If you have a liver problem, your doctor should monitor you very carefully while you are taking Zithromax. </div>  and possible interactions...  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Do not take Zithromax with antacids containing aluminum or magnesium, such as Maalox and Mylanta.   If Zithromax is taken with certain other drugs, the effects of either could be increased, decreased, or altered. It is especially important to check with your doctor before combining Zithromax with the following:  Nelfinavir (Viracept)  Warfarin (Coumadin)  Digoxin (Lanoxin, Lanoxicaps)  Ergot-containing drugs such as Cafergot and D.H.E.  Cyclosporine (Neoral and Sandimmune)  Hexobarbital  Phenytoin (Dilantin)</div>    Antibiotics are tremendously over-prescribed in this country.  My children rarely have ear/throat infections, so we have avoided most antibiotics, fortunately for them.  I call Zithromax \"the big guns\" antibiotic and feel that it should be prescribed only as a last result.  It kills most all the bacteria--not just the bad ones.  Then you have to \"build up\" the population of good bacteria all over again.  I\'ve always hated the diarrhea that so frequently occurs with an antibiotic use.</div>'

Especially those moments when I\'ve just plain had it and there he sits in front of the TV as I desperately try to straighten up the house or just take a breath.    HTRTC, that is a fascinating concept about appropriate use of delayed echolalia.  So is the TV helping or hurting, I wonder.    There are 2 interesting avenues I am thinking about.  Alex\'s mom, one is of course the RDI, which we discussed further downthread.  The concept of retraining someone to reference a parent... almost all the way back to the infantile level... is just mind boggling to me.  But if it will get Ryan to lose the disconnect and enter the world of fluid communication I will have to do it.    <em>The crappy thing is that I was scheduled to watch the second half of that RDI DVD tonight, along with some other awesome parents, but my husband decided it was more important to go to the Angels v. Houston game, so here I sit with the kiddos. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x\" title=\"Mad\" />  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x\" title=\"Mad\" />  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x\" title=\"Mad\" />   But I digress...</em>    I am intrigued as well by the little bit I read earlier about that Son-rise program.  I interpret what I am reading about it as me going into DS\'s world to bring him out.         So I use Son-Rise to go in and get him... coupled with the rigid yet clear expectations of ABA therapy teaching him how typical kids behave and speak...  along with the RDI teaching him to look to me to know it\'s all going to be OK...  and the darn biomed and diet that I just can\'t seem to get going on...  maybe it just might work.    And Alex\'s mom, thanks as well for your statement about declarative vs. questioning speech.  I found that has helped tremendously as well.    Again, I digress.    PS Gimmestrength I hope you look under \"respect\'s\" post about a home ABA program... she has a great link to someone who did a home ABA program but if you look on her site and read her bio, she discusses all the struggles she had with choosing treatment modalities, and it cites some excellent points about ABA.

When you are mimicking, you do not have to consider meaning.  It is meaningless.  Once speech becomes intentional, then there are the interfering factors necessary to actually convey meaning... what tone do I use, what words do I use, how do I say these words right.      Perhaps the TV talk is useful for assessing what sounds they are capable of making even if those same sounds have not been used purposefully yet.  Like a speech assessment.

I have bought probably every type of educational computer software that you can buy from local stores like Wal-Mart, Target...etc. Can your child use a mouse? I have just recently started finding some fabulous educational stuff on youtube of all places. I have been helping my daughter the parts of speech by the SchoolHouse Rock on youtube. They have fun Math videos too. I found all of the magic schoolbus and Bill Nye the Science Guy. I was so excited. My daughter learns so fast on the computer. I still work very hard with her on a daily basis, because of course are schools here are certainly less than perfect and she needs to learn to accept and take instruction from people too.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Elissa,  When my son was young and had genetic testing, he had low carnitine levels but his lactic and pyruvate levels were normal. I did some research at the time, and found it all very complicated and confusing. I did find some help on one of the Yahoo groups, called Meta-mito-autism, and I\'d suggest you try there.   You will have to send a message to the moderator explaining why you want to join the group. If I remember right, you have limited space to write the message, so you can\'t go into a lot of detail. Just give them the information about your son\'s visit to the geneticist and his lab results. You will be able to go into more detail when you post to the group.  This is the link to the group:  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Meta-mito-autism/\">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Meta-mito-autism/</a><!-- m --></div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">although it\'s early for a dx, it\'s never to early to keep an eye out.  Read some books especially ones with parent stories, although every autisic kid is different its, mind blowing how many behaviors, habits and other things that they share in common that never get mentioned in the things to watch for lists.  Looking back my son had many sensory issues that seem so obvious now as an infant.  But keep in mind that most of the behaviors start out as normal things that all babies do, ex arm flapping and toe walking, but they do it to excess and/or dont end the behavior at an appropriate time.  Arm flapping at 6mo when excited/upset is fine not at 2.  So as he/she is growing up keep that in mind.  Some of the things that I was apparently doing right long before I even suspected was pushing his frustraition lvls esp. with normal activities that he didn\'t like like bathing, breaking up his routine, and play with him when he didn\'t want me to.  When he was lining up his cars, I would flick them off the table, at first this was worthy of a big temper tantrum, but I kept at it, trying the whole time to not go too far.  And now most the time I get laughs and he starts pushing the cars off the table too.  These are all things you can do at early ages that can help alot, whether autisic or not.     And most importantly dont worry too much, an autism dx is not the end of the world.  My autisic son is a probably the happiest boy you\'ll ever meet, he is smart, in some ways wiser then his years, very social (just doesn\'t have appropriate social skills), knows how to have a good time, and is a very good well behaved boy 99% of the time, my family is always fighting over who gets to babysit him next, which doesn\'t happen frequently because I take him with me everywhere because life is boring without him.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I thought the 11 year old sibling was so heart warming, he obviously loved his brother but was sad about his and his family\'s situation.  Katie Wright was passionate and outspoken, and it seemed like Oprah wanted her to mention the vaccine link.  Agreed there was tons of stuff that wasn\'t covered, but I am hoping that Oprah will do several more shows on the subject so that the world can understand more about autism and that those living with autism in their families can learn about more options they may have.  I would love to see a respectful debate of causal link with several differing opinions on a future episode, for now it just seemed like a starting point for Oprah, we shall see if she pursues the topic further.  I thought the dad on the panel was wonderful, to really open up about not only his feelings towards his son, but also the sacrifice that has been necessary, particularly financial.  I would have loved to have seen a donation request made on the show, or for Oprah to announce that she is doing something ongoing to help, but perhaps now that she knows alittle more she will, the door is always open.  I wasn\'t very impressed with the doctor, and the fact that she was sat in the audience whereas the parents were all sat with Oprah sends a subtle message too.  I didn\'t learn anything new, but I didn\'t expect too, like the GREAT O said, it was a show to raise awareness and bring some compassion to families like us who live with it everyday.    Grandma C....don\'t feel guilty, I felt so sad for those beautiful children on the video and their families, relieved too that my burden is not so bad in comparison, and understanding that in order to get a message across the world needs to see those who are severly affected, they need to see the stimming, the lack of language, the changing diapers for a school aged child, I don\'t think there would be as much sympathy and compassion from the audience at large if the video depicted my Luke on his trampoline calling \"daddy, come and play popcorn!\".</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">We can\'t continue letting them be the boss. How do we draw the line, after how long, and all of that? </div>    I am lucky enough that my son is verbal and we can talk about this concept. And I have been stressing it with him really recently, because as a result of all this MB12, or Threelac, or whatever it is, he seems to be comprehending so much more and his conversational skills are also good enough. So, I have been doing w/ him what I did with my older two -- establishing my authority (or, re-establishing it as we sort of missed that stage back 18 mos ago when he was unreachable).  We have talked about mom being the \"boss\" because I\'m the mom and he is the child and he has to listen, because mom doesn\'t want him to get hurt. These are in terms he can understand. He will balk against it, and say, \"No, I\'m the mom!\" and I laugh . ..but I\'m still the mom and he\'s learning that.     I\'m grateful we can talk like this, and I\'m grateful I have the time to work with him. I would think one could also work out this concept in pictures, too, though.     But he has been extremely difficult lately ...not in an autistic way, but more in a stubborn little strong-willed child way. Was into my Easter ceramics yesterday, pulling a chair up to reach them on the top shelf ... I yelled a little, but actually reasoned with him to accept the plastic eggs I\'d bought for him.    I feel in my heart, that my child will respond to my discipline the best, because, drumroll ...I\'m his mom! He knows I love him, loves me, and so, it works best coming from me, and not 2 or 3 different therapists a day. I think these ABA folks are so up close and personal with our kids, in their homes, etc., and are trying to institute a lot of discipline that is really our territory. At least that\'s how is was for us, because they would not stick to teaching skills and wanted to discpline him -- but there is really no personal parent/child uncondtional love relationship, so it backfires.    Our consultant was making up all these points of discipline and I was like, \"Whaaa? Who says he has to put the toilet seat down after every flush?\"  We aren\'t there yet.. .I\'m still shooting for learning how to dress himself . ..it was just nuts. They were just imposing one rule after another, and it must have felt like a lead blanket to him. It did to me. I really feel we just had a bad group running our program. There are absolutely no doubt better out there.     But, I feel, in our case, my son is just doing well enough to go beyond ABA. He can absolutely now learn skills through his natural environment. And he has become, for all purposes, a bratty 5 1/2 year old. This is just something they can\'t handle. It\'s too complex to be handled within the realm of ABA teaching. Yes, he\'s still autistic, or at least showing some symptoms of that (not all), but he\'s also got a lot of normal skills and attitudes as well that can get him through.     Yesterday was the most wonderful day. It was a Monday, and since we had no ABA, we decided to go fly a kite. My little Joey was out flying a kite, all on his own (after we helped him get it up) , guiding it in the air, running back and forth, saying it was like an airplane and that it was coming into the airport for a landing when the wind would die down.  ... it was the most beautiful sight I\'ve seen so far ... (too bad my husband was along and we were arguing) .. .but I was trying my best not to miss it.  It is just times like this I want more of, and less therapy sessions. So, so far so good on day one with no ABA.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Joey, 6 yrs., PDD-NOS  GFCF, Yasko, RDI  Did ABA for 14 mos.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Joey, 6 yrs., PDD-NOS  GFCF, Yasko, RDI  Did ABA for 14 mos.</div>'

As I think back what I did was, I forgot to give him his calmag supplement those 2 days but I gave everything else and I also just added reduce L-gluthatione lotion from kirkman lab on Monday, he also just started his new batch of MB12 on Monday of his 2 cycles; do you think any of these changes can impact his behavior or regression does occur and many cases I heard will actually start a good changes once the regression dissapear??? I am not sure...  Just fyi: I give him EnzymecompleteII, folinic acid, vit c, calmag, ndf plus,   glutamine, cod fish oil, omega III ( nordic),spectrum complete, mb12.  Thank you for any input.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Mommy in CA,    he he he Thanks so much for your response. I had to laugh! You are too funny but I have to agree it doesn\'t seem to make sense to get Bobby help for another child\'s problems. Another mom that lives very close to me warned me about this child 2 years ago. I didn\'t know it was the same child until I saw the cub scout list of names last year (about a month after we started the new den and I met everyone) and it dawned on me. ugh By then it was too late, Bobby was involved and we were all signed up and I had even volunteered to help with field trips... DH was studying to be a leader...    <span style=\"color: red\">BUT! Today we have a small success! Before he went to school today, I discussed with Bobby some things I had read in the book I\'m currently still reading (\"Good Friends Are Hard To Find\" by Frank Frankel, PHD). That\'s the one that said not to say the \"sticks and stones...\" phrase. Instead, he states to laugh off the tease or to make nothing of it with words. He says to tell your child to say things like: I\'ve heard that before, So what, What?, etc. So before school today we went over about 10 different responses and focused on one. I felt he at least had the \"I heard that one before\" response down pat though I had read off all of them to him. I honestly didn\'t think much of it until I picked him up from school...  Today afterschool he came over to the car, hopped in and said with a HUGE GRIN THAT IT WORKED!!! I guess at recess this leader\'s child came over and said to my son that another boy said some bad things about him (Bobby) like he farts or something like that. Bobby responded very simply, \"so what.\" The boy didn\'t know what to say, couldn\'t tattle because Bobby didn\'t say anything wrong and that was it!!! </span>  Of course now I\'m reading this darn book from cover to cover!!! I\'ll let you know how it goes. So far it gets an A+!     thanks again!    audrey</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ B, 10, AS  LMB Bell V/V &amp; OCN, pragmatic lang, fiber, vits, avoid gluten, Nord Nat omega 3-6-9.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ B, 10, AS  LMB Bell V/V  OCN, pragmatic lang, fiber, vits, avoid gluten, Nord Nat omega 3-6-9.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">ausmum, I don\'t disagree with you on that.  However, I looked up the Tennessee law and the bottom line is, if the parents don\'t want to get the disabled child any help at all, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">its solely their decision</span>.  The state won\'t step in and won\'t question that decision - its purely unilateral.  I was really surprised to find this out.       My husband and I considered getting custody last year after my stepson made the \"he\'s money to me\" statement, in writing and because I was the only one to have gotten this boy any help at all despite his parents\' lack of cooperation.  However, not furnishing a developmentally disabled child an education or even medical care for the condition is not on the list of things that either DCS or the state cares about because the disabled person is the family\'s problem, not the state of Tennessee\'s.  See citation below.      It is mandatory under federal law for the state to provide the opportunity for education and care.  It is not mandatory on the parents to obtain it.    TCA 33-5-202 <strong>Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities, State Policy â€” Principles for developing programs</strong>  (a)  The policy of the state is that persons with severe or developmental disabilities and their families be afforded supports that emphasize community living and enable them to enjoy typical lifestyles.  (b)  Programs to support families shall be based on the following principles:  (1)  <em>Families and individuals with severe or developmental disabilities are best able to determine their own needs and should be empowered to make decisions concerning necessary, desirable, and appropriate services and supports.</em>  (3)  Family support is needed throughout the life span of the person who has a severe or developmental disability.</div>'

Some states offer modest grants to pay for respite care or therapies that insurance won\'t cover, like speech and OT.

He said that many children do that.</div>    If this is the case, then chances are he may have a hard time paying attention to the teacher in class as well. I\'m not saying it\'s a sign of PDD, but IMO it\'s a sign that he may still need some support to keep him on task. Especially since there are still some behavioral kinks that need to be ironed out. They can always fade out the supports when appropriate, not make it seem like the support person is there for your son (so he won\'t look \"different\" to his friends) etc.   Incidentally, my son\'s evaluator earlier this year said she could not repeat any questions, and I couldn\'t \"redirect\" either. All I was allowed to do was \"warn\" him (like- here comes another question type thing). He lost many points because he didn\'t pay attention to the question.  Our evaluation this spring included something called \"educational evaluation\" (I think ), where she basically tested academic knowledge. My son scored at or beyond Kindergarten (he was in pre-K at the time), yet his inattention (plus other PDD issues) make him really need an aide at all times  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /> .   Agree with the speech, too, but lately I came to find overall classroom behavior more important than speech issues.    Best of luck to your son , and may he keep up this wonderful progress.

One, a very pretty smart and verbal girl, was suicidal and to had be in and out of this clinic. Her parents even bought her her own home and hired her a housekeeper so that she would be close to the therapy center (it was 1 hour away) but had to sell it when she went into the institution.    I do not know as much about the boy, all I know is that his parents could no longer cope.     I am sure there are some that might recover on their own but I would not trust to that at all.

It certainly can\'t hurt.  When is the medical community going to wake-up and realize autism CAN be treated?  If there are no studies according to the \"experts,\" then WHY don\'t they STOP wasting time and DO SOME STUDIES?

His eye contact is good unless he feels pressured and is looking to avoid at which time it becomes more inconsistent but still OK. Aidan sounds much like your son. I was told that he shared enough characteristics to be on the spectrum but did not fit all the criterion for autism and also even within the criterion he did fit nothing was really severe, so they gave him PDD-NOS label. They felt very optimistic specifically because of his eye contact, language (even though it\'s minimal) and the fact that he exhibited joint attention with the examiner and the dev. pediatrician.   I was so, so nervous before the evaluation even though I pretty much knew what the findings would be. It has been about 2 weeks and I can say I feel so much better now to have something tangible to work with. the dev. pediatrician went over all of Aidan\'s strengths and weaknesses and helped us map out a plan for him, so now we are busy with that. For me the anxiety of the evaluation was the harder part. Best of luck. Feel free to ask me as many questions as you need about Aidan or his evaluation or anything else.

Maybe mom has to, heaven forbid, tinkle, or go into another room to answer the phone or run downstairs to get something. </div>    Danny\'s Mom,  I completely understand. I went through a time when I couldn\'t leave my two sons alone for even one minute. One got a bad sprain during the two minutes I was on the phone with his pediatrician, who had called me!

If possible, ask the school system to experiment with different things, PECs, whatever.    We kept the cribs up with a special crib tent over them, for when I had to use the bathroom or make a planned call. This was until age 3 or 4, when most kids were in beds. Not a perfect solution, but it did keep them safe. I\'ve heard of one family who created a safe room with a lock, nothing that can be climbed, no furniture, safe toys only, no window blinds or curtains, and a window in the door so the boy could be checked on. This was for when the mom had to take a shower or cook. It sounds extreme, but it can be very hard if your child is a runner, can unlock doors, is extremely active and has no understanding of danger.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">hey, just wanted to say how I hope you are feeling better. I\'m writing this pretty late so I wanted to send you one of my favorite jokes to help brighten up your new day! (while we\'re posting jokes and all!)     Rachel        Little Bobby came into the kitchen where his mother was making dinner.    His birthday was coming up and he thought this was a good time to tell his mother what he wanted.    Mom, I want a bike for my birthday.    Little Bobby was a bit of a troublemaker.    He had gotten into trouble at school and at home.    Bobbyâ€™s mother asked him if he thought he deserved to get a bike for his birthday.    Little Bobby, of course, thought he did.    Bobbyâ€™s mother wanted Bobby to reflect on his behavior over the last year.    Go to your room, Bobby, and think about how you have behaved this year.    Then write a letter to God and tell him why you deserve a bike for your birthday.    Little Bobby stomped up the steps to his room and sat down to write God a letter.    **************    Letter 1    Dear God,    I have been a very good boy this year and I would like a bike for my birthday.    I want a red one.    Your friend,    Bobby    **************    Bobby knew that this wasnâ€™t true. He had not been a very good boy this year,    So he tore up the letter and started over.    **************    Letter 2    Dear God,    This is your friend Bobby. I have been a good boy this year and I would like    A red bike for my birthday. Thank you.    Your friend,    Bobby    **************    Bobby knew that this wasnâ€™t true either. So, he tore up the letter and started again.    **************    Letter 3    Dear God,    I have been an OK boy this year. I still would really like a bike for my birthday.    Bobby    **************    Bobby knew he could not send this letter to God either. So, Bobby wrote a fourth letter.    **************    Letter 4    God,    I know I havenâ€™t been a good boy this year. I am very sorry.    I will be a good boy if you just send me a bike for my birthday.    Please! Thank you,    Bobby    **************    Bobby knew, even if it was true, this letter was not going to get him a bike.    Now, Bobby was very upset. He went downstairs and told his mom that he wanted to go to church.    Bobbyâ€™s mother thought her plan had worked, as Bobby looked very sad.    Just be home in time for dinner, Bobbyâ€™s mother told him.    Bobby walked down the street to the church on the corner.    Little Bobby went into the church and up to the altar.    He looked around to see if anyone was there.    Bobby bent down and picked up a statue of the Mary.    He slipped the statue under his shirt and ran out of the church, down the street, into the house, and up to his room.    He shut the door to his room and sat down with a piece of paper and a pen.    Bobby began to write his letter to God.    **************    Letter 5    God,    Iâ€™VE KIDNAPPED YOUR MAMA. IF YOU WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN, SEND THE BIKE</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Chilliwackmom.  Where do you live?  Here in Kansas, part of the paperwork you get when your child becomes eligible for services includes agencies that will provide advocates for you (they are independent of the school system).  You can ask the social worker if she knows about this.  Also, is the social worker any help?  All I can say is that I really really sympathize and also really really commend you.  You are doing the very best that you can to work directly with your son and be supportive of the school staff, but you simply cannot be expected to do it all.  Hopefully, social workers...they aren\'t all great, but I am one and would like to think that they would understand your situation and provide some representation for you at school meetings so you don\'t have be alone in this process.  (or be subject to that us vs. you mentality)...  Hang in there.  I don\'t have a lot of time to write, but others may post on information about where to get an advocate in your town.  In ours, it is agencies like KEYS for Networking and/or Families Together, etc.  Even those may know of agencies based in other cities that do the kind of work they do.  Good luck and good job.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">The last resort is time out, and I\'ve actually never done it but my husband has.  Only for things like hitting.    We don\'t so much discipline him as make him follow through with whatever it is he is supposed to be doing, and that often includes physically maneuvering him around and making him do it.  Like if it\'s time to clean up and he won\'t come to the room, I will pick him up and move his arm to put away some things.  Then let him chill and tantrum for a while and see if he\'s ready to do it on his own, and if not, repeat the same thing.  This is actually quite effective.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I have 2 boys, one with Asperger\'s Syndrome (he is high-functioning, and probably has a genius-level intellect) who is 7, and one with PDD-NOS who just turned 5 a couple days ago.  We have both children in ABA therapy (we have a girl that comes in to help us) and the younger boy goes to speech therapy 2-3 times a week. Insurance doesn\'t cover any of this--my company self-insures, which means no autism coverage. We are trying to get services from the school district, but that will take months. Both boys are home-schooled, which is working out very well for us.  It is the younger boy that I am worried about&#058; he seems to be about a year behind in language and acts &quot;babyish&quot; for his age. He was formally diagnosed with PDD-NOS 6 months ago after extensive testing. I really worry about his development and long-term prospects.   So here is the question: does anyone here have children with PDD-NOS? Have you found treatments or therapies that work well? What have been your experiences?  I want to make sure I am covering all the bases here  Autism (especially Asperger\'s) runs in my wife\'s side of the family -it is genetic, so nothing to do with diet, etc. Her father and brother have Asperger\'s.  an advice would be great</div>'

I suspect in many cases it is ignorance (and I don\'t mean that in a derogatory way) and concern.  For those of us who have had positive experiences with biomed, there are others who have been less fortunate.  And I also imagine that there are therapists out there who have witnessed parents who have attempted things carelessly and without proper support or understanding of what they were doing.  We also have to keep in mind how much has surfaced in terms of research within just the past 5 years.  Therapists who have been around much longer might just be a little more jaded than some of the younger ones.     So while I agree that it is very annoying and frustrating as a parent to have a therapist assume to know more than they do, or to have them be closed-minded or judgmental about changes that can be truly beneficial for our children, I don\'t necessarily agree that it is always about money.</div>'

A mother who faces similar pressures explains         When Pauline Leonard heard about the tragic case of Alison Davies, who apparently committed suicide with her 12-year-old son Ryan, she was sad but not surprised.           Paulineâ€™s son, Patrick James, is 14 and has severe autism. PJ has a mental age of 2, cannot speak and is still in nappies. He attends a special-needs school and is taken out by carers two evenings a week for two-hour outings. Otherwise Pauline is a full-time carer (PJ has virtually no contact with his father, who split up with Pauline when PJ was two). She once briefly contemplated suicide but immediately sought help. She is now on antidepressants and has asked for counselling.     Pauline lives in a three-bedroomed semi-detached house near Manchester with PJ, Richard (her partner of two years) and Rick, her stepson from a previous relationship (Rick and PJ share the same father). For three years, PJ has spent two nights a month at the Mount Carmel, a care home run by a Catholic charity, but the home will close next month. Every year, Pauline spends a week in Spain without PJ; her sister Breda moves in to care for him.     Of the case of Alison and Ryan Davies, Pauline says: â€œIt has happened before and it will happen again. That woman was the same age as me and her son was only two years younger than PJ. I read that Ryan could ride a bike and play football, which PJ has never been able to do. But I know what that poor woman went through. I know how scary it is to have a child that is getting bigger than you, and who youâ€™re going to lose control over. People should know the reality of caring for a child with severe autism. Itâ€™s an absolute nightmare that you hope youâ€™ll wake up from, but you never do.â€     Here, Pauline describes her life with PJ...    I know itâ€™s a terrible thing to say about your own flesh and blood, but PJ is like a little animal. He doesnâ€™t talk; he grunts. Nine times out of ten, PJ wants to run about wild. Heâ€™s very, very hyperactive. He canâ€™t sit still for two minutes. Thatâ€™s why heâ€™s only 5Â½ stone (35kg). Heâ€™s always jumping up and down, grunting, and heâ€™s bitten his hands so much out of frustration that the skin around his knuckles is dead. He does try to speak, and says â€œmum mumâ€. But I know heâ€™ll never say, â€œI love you mum mumâ€. If he ever spoke, those would be the few words Iâ€™d want to hear.     He knows that Iâ€™m his mum and that I love him with a passion. When I say, â€œGive me a big love (hug)â€, heâ€™ll offer me his cheek and cuddle me. He doesnâ€™t know how to kiss properly. When PJ tries to talk to people, he goes right into their face and starts babbling.     The best times are when he smiles and gives me a little bit of eye contact. It gives me so much pleasure because I know that at that moment in time heâ€™s really with us. Otherwise heâ€™s in his own little world. The most upsetting thing is looking at other 14-year-olds and thinking that that should be my PJ, and instead Iâ€™m still changing his nappies. It breaks my heart.     He is still a very young baby, so thereâ€™s no way he can play outside. Iâ€™ve been in the garden and seen a slug in his mouth. Heâ€™ll eat anything â€” worms, grass, mud, slugs. It sounds disgusting but if he could get faeces out of the toilet, heâ€™d eat that. Heâ€™d eat the contents of his nappy if I wasnâ€™t watching. When he was younger, he used to smear the stuff in his nappy around the room. We have laminate flooring in his bedroom and plastic covers over the bed. Heâ€™s still got a baby gate on his bedroom door at 14, God love him.     When heâ€™s at home, he spends most of his time walking up and down the kitchen, holding a tea towel for comfort. He also likes the music channels on television. Heâ€™ll sit on the settee with his legs crossed, shaking his body and nodding. Heâ€™s always smiling, always got a grin on his face.     He eats the same food as me but I feed him, otherwise it would go everywhere. He loves Rice Krispies, sausages, trifle â€” all the foods that kids love. Heâ€™d eat a whole trifle by himself if I let him. I like to dress him well â€” in the same things that other 14-year-olds are wearing, and his brothers buy him nice things like Reebok trainers. The neighbours always tell me what a wonderful job Iâ€™m doing. But they donâ€™t know how extra hard it is behind closed doors.     About two years ago, I got really depressed. For a split second, I thought, â€œIf I do something stupid, like take these pills, and die, then PJ will be really well looked after.â€ But I thought about my other boys. And Iâ€™d never have taken PJ with me.     I went to my doctor and told him. He gave me antidepressants. Iâ€™ve also arranged to go for counselling. Now, Iâ€™m ashamed that I even thought that way. Iâ€™m a strong person, but I think there are a lot of women who are not as strong as me. Alison Davies probably wasnâ€™t strong enough to go to her doctor and say, â€œI feel suicidalâ€. Itâ€™s like admitting defeat, that you canâ€™t look after your own children. I also think parents fear that their children will be taken away from them.     As far as I know, PJ was normal when he was born. He was just starting to talk, at 2, when he got really poorly with bronchitis. He went into intensive care and when he came out, he couldnâ€™t do the same things as before. But I didnâ€™t really know anything was wrong until he was 2Â½, and the health visitor said that he didnâ€™t have very good eye contact. A paediatrician told me he had mild learning difficulties, and suggested nursery, so that he could be around other children. He didnâ€™t come on.     When he was 3, I went to a group run by parents of children with special needs, and a few of them said PJ was showing the signs of autism. Thatâ€™s when I realised he was autistic. I knew it in my heart and soul â€” I just needed someone to tell me. In fact, autism was diagnosed only last year. It needs to be diagnosed by a psychiatrist and we saw one only last year after I kept badgering people about it. He went to special-needs nursery, and then a special-needs school. I have a nephew with learning difficulties; I think the women in my family are carriers of a faulty gene.     As soon as I knew something was wrong with PJ, when he was a baby, I felt like Iâ€™d lost him. It was as if someone had handed me back a shell who just looked like him. It was as if the real PJ had died, and here was this strange little person that Iâ€™d have for the rest of my life. I was grieving for the perfect baby that I used to have. I still find it very very hard to accept him the way he is. I canâ€™t get my head round it. When itâ€™s your child, itâ€™s devastating. And what have I ever done to deserve this? I feel cheated. I still believe in God but Iâ€™m angry with Him because Heâ€™s made my PJ suffer. PJ hasnâ€™t received his confirmation or communion. He wouldnâ€™t understand it so it would just be a big show for everyone else and I still feel so angry.     You know what the problem is? Sometimes, I feel like itâ€™s just me and PJ against the world. You get so low. From the minute you open your eyes to the minute you close them, that child is on your mind. You donâ€™t want to lose your patience but your head is pounding. You feel like running out of the house screaming, but you canâ€™t. Itâ€™s as if someoneâ€™s ripped out my heart. People say, â€œI donâ€™t know how you do it, Pauline,â€ but I have to do it. PJ is my son. I think I love him more because I know he depends on me.     PJâ€™s condition affected my relationship with PJâ€™s father â€” it broke us up. Weâ€™d been together for five years. I donâ€™t think he could cope, although heâ€™s still in contact with Rick. When I met Richard, he said, â€œI donâ€™t know if I can cope with this.â€ I told him, â€œThank you for being honest with me.â€ Itâ€™s very hard on him, because heâ€™s not PJâ€™s dad, but Richardâ€™s so good with him. He wonâ€™t change nappies but Richard will mind PJ if I want to pop to the shops. And heâ€™ll give PJ his food.     With Mount Carmel closing, Iâ€™ve lost a lifeline. When PJ was away I would light candles, have a bubble bath and just chill. Iâ€™m told that heâ€™ll probably get a place somewhere else. Iâ€™ve noticed that social services provision has improved as PJ has got older, and his carers are brilliant. If PJ had Downâ€™s syndrome, everyone would feel sorry for him. But when he starts playing up, people see him screaming at the top of his lungs and think, â€œWhy canâ€™ t she control her own kid?â€ People look really, really shocked. I canâ€™t take him shopping, and he misses out on his cousinsâ€™ birthday parties because he canâ€™t cope with crowds. He canâ€™t visit Santa at Christmas.     And now itâ€™s such a shock to see him turning into a young man. Heâ€™s got spots, and I shaved him for the first time two weeks ago. I cried. I have to wash him, and it upsets me to see him in the shower. Soon heâ€™ll be getting sexual urges, and that worries me big time. Puberty frightens the life out of any mother, and it scares me because I wonâ€™t be in control. My baby is a young man now, and soon heâ€™s going to be bigger than me. His brotherâ€™s 6ft tall.     Heâ€™s very placid now but what if he turned violent? I worry about what will happen when I die. I hope that heâ€™ll reach 21 before that happens, and he can move into sheltered accommodation with someone else his own age. Even though Rick and Keith love PJ and worship the ground he walks on, I donâ€™t want either of them to look after him out of duty. I donâ€™t want their lives ruined.     Iâ€™d like to meet other parents in Manchester in the same position. Just someone to have a cup of tea with, or whatever. It would have helped so much if, when PJ was young, there was somewhere I could have gone and said, â€œDo you know what? PJ ate what was in his nappy.â€ And someone else would say, â€œOh, my kid did that last week.â€ People need to know that theyâ€™re not the only ones with severely autistic children.

It would have cost us Â£200,000 to keep it open.â€ Pauline Newman, director of childrenâ€™s services for Manchester City Council, said: â€œIt is regrettable that Mount Carmel should have to close.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi, everyone.     I am the mom of a 6-year-old boy with a neurological disorder that results in numerous medical, behavioral, and developmental issues and I recently opened a website for the artistic expression of parents of children with special needs - through essays, poetry, photography, and artwork.       (Just a few days ago we also opened sections for the art of children as well.)     I won\'t go on at length about why I opened it because there\'s a page there entitled \"About this Site\" which explains that.  It\'s an open forum - anyone can submit who wishes to.  The work there ranges from published/professional writers and artists to those who are very inexperienced and trying this sort of thing for the first time.  The site is there to encourage the artistic process for the benefit of all those who wish to use it, not to evaluate the work.     The other role of the site is simply to be available for viewing so, whether you submit or not, I encourage anyone who finds value in it to visit and visit often.     The link is <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://ourkids.typepad.com/\">http://ourkids.typepad.com/</a><!-- m --> if you\'d like to take a look.  (Thank you, Bill, for giving the ok to post this link.)  There are a number of essays, poems and photos there already from parents of children with autism, as well as art and poetry by children with autism themselves.    It\'s only been open publicly for three weeks so any feedback or suggestions are welcome.  Thank you!     All my best,  Mya-Lisa</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello Halx67 welcome to the board although these aren\'t the best circumstances.  I\'m so glad you found us.  This is a great place to vent, rant, blow off steam and share your joys and sorrows with a great group of people who understand just how exciting it is the first time your kid says a word, even if it is \"no\".   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" />     You got a lot of places to start it doesn\'t really matter which one or several you decide to do just get started. (its like the joke Q: How do you eat an elephant?  A: One bite at a time.)  And having said that I\'m going to suggest one thing to do first anyway.  The place where your child was diagnosed, call them back and tell them you want a social worker, or want to get in touch with one.  Right after my son\'s diagnosis they had me talk to one and it was one of the best things I\'d ever done.  He gave me a list of services available in our area.  I went home that day and got my son on all of the various waiting lists and they ALL had waiting lists.      This is a fairly new disorder, at least in these numbers and the programs are not yet funded very well or easily available unless you get lucky and new jersey has a good program.  It sounded like Mavasback is in NJ if that is right definately email her and see which waiting lists you should get on and call all of them from both sources.  Then you start doing the programs as they become available.      Then while you are waiting there are things you can do reading all the books and visiting the websites to learn as much as you can, starting the diet if you decide you want to try biomedical.  You make better decisions and are less afraid when you have the knowledge to make them intelligently.    It is hard to do all of this through the emotional devastation and loss of the dreams you had for your child.  But as you get into this and see the progress and growth they are capable of some of the dreams do come back.  And they can learn, it takes more time and effort and repeating and repeating and then repeating some more but they can learn.  There are so many great effective programs out there that have made all the difference between mainstreaming and becoming indistinguishable from their peers or being warehoused in an institution.  None of us want that so we are all fighting as best we can for our children and now you have joined the fight.  It is hard but rewarding and you come to treasure your child all the more, and find joy in the steps they make big or small.      I know I\'ve gone and written a novel so I\'ll finish with two pieces of advice.      One disregard every epidemiological (statistical study) you find from either side of the mercury debate.  Look at the biological studies and clinical trials.  Epidemiological studies can be manipulated to say what the authors of the study want them to say.  Indeed there are lies, darn lies, and statistics.  There is also a book called \"How to Lie with Statistics\" that pretty much says it all.    Second either you or your wife go to every therapy session with your daughter.  Go and watch the early intervention programs see what they do, ask questions, observe how they work with your child and get her to do things you never though she would.  Go with her to speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, volunteer in her preschool class.  Then when you learn something take it home and incorporate it into your interactions with your child.  This was the hardest but most effective thing I did for my son\'s recovery, change how I interacted with him to get him to do the things I wanted him to do.  He was making progress but didn\'t really start moving until we started doing them at home.  The more intense the therapy and earlier they are when they start it the closer they will come to their full potential.    There is hope and the dreams do come back even if (as I\'ve said in an earlier post) they are closer to the cieling than the sky.  There is recovery, and new research and techniques being found all the time.  Come here often ask questions someone here should be able to help you.  It is one of the more supportive non judmental places on the internet.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">One of the things I really loved about volunteering at my son\'s school (Pingree School for Autistic Children) is that one of their focuses was \"catch them being good\".  You want to reinforce the desired behavior so you have to watch for it and praise it and reward it (the behavior).      So if the team is being very negative and only negatively reinforcing the undesired behaviors he is not going to show improved behaviors because when he does do them they won\'t be reinforced.      Training myself to watch for and reward desired behaviors (positive reinforcement) has made me a better mother to all four of my kids not just my affected DS.      The rewards have to be something they really care about though.  It doesn\'t have to be as obvious as candy or a toy.  For my son his major struggle has been verbalizing and communication.  Whenever he asked for something verbally (at least at first) he always got what he\'d asked for along with me praising him for \"using his words\".  Thus showing him that verbalizing got results and praise.  He still struggles with it but I almost never have to prompt him to \"use his words\" anymore.    Way back in the stone ages I took a course at college that was early childhood education and one of the few things I actually remember was that positive reinforcement was effective and negative reinforcement was effective but that when the two were used together it was more effective than when they were used alone.      Training yourself to have deliberate responses to their actions is hard, it took me quite a while to change the way I interacted with my son, everything got either a positive or negative reinforcement.  Although he did and does get down time to just go play in his room his way.    Anyway the point is that they may have a great program but if they are leaving out the vital positive reinforcement then it is missing a key element.  And maybe they just need to train their therapists in the the techniques of catching them being good.    If you are anywhere in the Utah area you may want to contact them and see if they have any programs that may be available to you.  I know they were trying to branch out to the school districts to teach their autism classrooms.  There was also some talk of an online program to help parents learn the program and work with their children themselves.  But I don\'t know if it happened or not.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi GMAC!  I am responding to another thread in which you indicated that your son\'s speech took a while to get going but then exploded.  Would you mind elaborating a little on what you did to get conversational speech going, and whether your son did video scripting (which is going to drive me to drink!)?    Our son is 3 years, 4 months old.  At 2 he had no words.  Now he has a large vocabulary, pretty decent articulation.  He sings, requests and comments on things (Mommy drive a car, Daddy go upstairs, big yellow ball, etc.).  He is not conversational, can\'t seem to understand turn-taking, can answer a basic question if paying attention, but then the \"conversation\" falls flat.  Also, he can recite every Bob the Builder, Barney, Dora, etc. video ever made.  Recently, he has used a couple of things from videos appropriately, e.g. when his sisters get out of the car to go to school, he says \"Have a great day!\" which is from a Barney video.    Lately, I\'ve been feeling totally hopeless.  I\'m getting sick of hearing about hope because I\'m an impatient sort who wants it all and I want it now (okay, I\'m a big baby, I admit it!) <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarassed\" /> .  His vocabulary exploded just after he turned two, but I feel like the progress has plateaued and I don\'t know what to do about it.  I hear about other kids talking in full sentences and making conversation, and I just can\'t imagine ever getting there.  What was it like for you?  Thanks, Elise</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">first of all..remember that she is only 3 and even a NT child would probably not like sharing her daddy.  next, if you have any relationship with the mom..talk with her for ideas on what to do with her.  It is in her best interest as the child\'s mom to have a civil relationship with you for the child\'s sake.  If the mom has her on a special diet or schedule, respect that and keep her to it.  Maybe get some of the same toys that she enjoys playing with at her home.  Read some books about autism..many kids don\'t like being touched, kissed, etc until they really feel comfortable with the person.  And most importantly, have patience, lots of patience.  As for having another child be prepared for a bit of jealousy and how you and your husband to be will deal with it.  You will have the strength of a four or five year old with the probable mentality of a two year old.  My friend had lots of problems with her new baby with her stepson that was PDD.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">MCA,    It sounds like a transition issue to me.  We recently moved, and Gabriel has progressed in some areas but regressed in others.  Maybe your son just needs some time to adapt to the changes in his routine.  Everybody goes through rough spots anyway.  I\'m not sure why we think autistic people should be any different.  Maybe it\'s just that the rest of us are better at hiding our feelings. How many times have you heard people who had no clue there was anything wrong with their friend or loved one during the aftermath of a suicide?  Incidentally, when your son mentions that his tummy hurts is it before something that might be provoking anxiety?  I used to get phantom tummy aches every day before school for years even though it was a very familiar setting.  The act of leaving my home and my mother was highly stressful to me.  I know, from my son\'s experience, that anxiety can begin at any time, so even if you haven\'t noticed it before, it might be something worth looking into.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">As a 10+yr. SLP, I\'ve worked with several children on the autism spectrum with using PECS to improve functional communication.  I\'ve had much success with children who are non-verbal (with and without behaviors).  I\'ve also had success with children with limited verbalizations, echolalia, and yes I have been surprised with using PECS and children began to talk (not all, but a few).  My advice: in looking at using PECS, make sure you have someone who KNOWS how to teach the system; you as parents-LEARN the system; and GENERALIZE PECS into many different settings.    If you happen to live in the Montgomery County of Maryland (close to Washington, DC), I do offer a 1-month PECS initiation and teachings to children ages 3-6 yrs old.

' <div class=\"postbody\">WOW...great response and question.  Now you are thinking.  Let me try to explain this the best I can via e-mail.  Lets keep working this through until I can explain myself thoroughly because this technique works.    ABA - method is based on treating external behaviors by changing externals in the environment (extrinsic rewards or literally changing the environment).  The goal of most behavioral programs is to find what intrinsically reinforces the child so that the teaching methods internalize (with the desire of fading out the reinforcers).  In no way am I discounting the power of ABA and the impact that changing the enviornment has on the child.  Remember, ABA is composed of an educational component and a behavioral component.  From my understanding and what I have witnessed the educational component of ABA works effectively however parents all over the world have continued to struggle and be frustrated with the fact that the child\'s behaviors, in one form or another, never go away.      JOIT - method is based on changing the mind/body in order to  repattern the inappropriate or aggressive thought patterns and the internal cellular memory (cognitive/physiological/behavioral) patterns that ultimately shifts the behaviors.    In step one I was teaching you how to teach the child to relax.  I mentioned there were other steps that will get the child to the place of not tantruming.   Did you try the first step yet prior to mentalizing what you were doing?  The child usually is uncomfortable and after you relax them appropriately usually 9/10 they start requesting to be relaxed.    From your response I think you are asking the theory behind the technique.    1.  Cognitively - when a child goes into fight or flight they go unconscious.  Counting systematically in a rhythmic fashion provides the mind with the opportunity to calm down, focus and then respond rather than react (see... if you are teaching a child what not to do when they are angry, frustruated, anxious, etc.  the chances of the consquence being effective is less likely in fact usually the child becames more angry and frustrated and they might even remember the incident and become more angry the next time).  Remember even in ABA the goal is to get the child to RESPOND vs React.  2.  Physiologically - the brain, the spine and the peripherial nervous system has cellular memory.  The cell either FIRES or it doesn\'t.  In the body when it goes into a state of fight or flight the muscles contract.  The child tenses up, he might hit, drop to the ground, etc.  One method some people use to support the release of the contracted muscle or cell is by using (I blocked on the word....I think it is joint compression - where a therapist applies pressure to the wrist and the elbow simultaneously creating a muscle contraction....it is a contraction upon a contraction which creates a release).  What I am saying is that by rubbing down the arm the therapist would be relaxing the contraction and retraining the cells to go into a state of relaxation upon the contraction.  The more a therapist can externally support relaxing the muscles and cells internally the more rapid the message is sent to the brain to relax and once the message is sent to the brain the brain will be already being relaxed via the systematic counting sequence and the body and mind start to align in a rhythmic relaxed state.  Fact:  touch heals vs harms.  See studies on the healing of hands.      Behaviorally - YES YES YES.  Once the child has been taught to relax then yes of course you can explain to child what they have done incorrectly, wrong or inappropriately.  NOW, the chances of the child being present (conscious) have increased and he might even listen without tantruming or acting out after the parent/therapist has discussed in a calm manner the problem behavior.    SO....here is the rest of the technique:  Step one I already discussed above    Step two...  8888888888  0000000000  1. Arange the token board the same way.  This time pick 3 behaviors that your child displays that you are trying to diminish.  2.  Start off with the FHSL (Feet down, hands quiet, sit up straight and look - remember it is in a sing song rhythmic fashion to strengthen the left hemisphere).  Give blue token  3.  Relax - give red token  4.  NOW...if at any time the child the child displays one of the 3 behaviors listed you pull one blue token and say \"uh\" - like oops you just started tantruming but more specifically you pull one blue token each time the child cries, screams or drops to the ground (NEVER PULL THE RED TOKENS).  If you have identified \"\"the  tantrum\" as the behavior remember to list 3 feature of the tantrum to focus on e.g. crying, screaming and dropping to the ground.  5.  To earn the token back the child must comply with the command FHSL.  6.  If all the blue tokens are off the board relax the child until calm and then make sure the child earns the blue tokens removed back before you continue.    THERE ARE SOME TECHNIQUES AND A TECHNIQUE ON HOW TO COMBINE THIS WITH AN THE ABA EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT.    This is what it might look like in a session.  Fhsl - blue token  Relax 3 count - red token  fhsl - blue token  Relax - red token  THE CHILD SCREAMS - remove blue token  HE SCREAMS AGAIN - remove blue token  He stops screaming - implement fhsl - blue token  Fhsl (to earn the second token back) - blue token  FHSL - blue token  the token board will look like this  88  000  next relax - red token  888  000    Please continue to ask questions.

Many of those who chelate and do not have DNA damage become FULLY recovered and do not need the shots.

At this time it is not known if those without DNA damage will need the shots forever as MB12 makes glutathione which is the body\'s natural chelator. This may take kids off by itself given time.

' <div class=\"postbody\">OK... I surrender!!! I\'m having an emotional moment (probably PMS), and now that I\'ve finally shared the news with my \"real-life\" autism-mom friend (that I actually met here on AW), I\'ll share some of it with my \"e-only-friends.\"  I\'m actually SO excited!!    First off, he\'s finally hitting that \"verbal explosion\" that many have described.  He\'s also started waving hello and goodbye (he waved a little in the past and lost the skill, but NEVER did so as appropriately or consistently), and he\'s even saying \"hi\" and \"bye\" (sounds more like \"aye\" and \"aye-aye\") as he waves.  Thursday morning, he surprised us all (parents and therapists) all morning.  First with the waving and saying hi with prompting, then with playing SO well along side of the other kids, then by looking up at the therapist with the bubble machines and saying, \"bwo bubbu!!\" (blow bubbles)... as if that wasn\'t cool enough, he later (with prompting) said \"agi bwo bubbu\" (again blow bubbles).  Way cool - 3 words together!!!  He\'s been attempting so many new words and sounds that I can\'t keep track.  He\'s even saying his own version of mama now, though it sounds more like \"bma-bma\"...  Also, that same morning, as we were leaving, he walked over to one of the kids from playgroup (one that he likes, I can just tell  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /> ) and waved bye-bye to him without prompting!  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" />   It was at this point that his therapist (also home therapist) got goosebumps and tears in her eyes.  It continued from there.     Today while walking with Dad, a man said hello to him, to which he responded by waving and saying \"aye\" (hi).  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" />     He has also started using a fork!  AND, he attempted to point tonight when I asked him to point to what he wanted.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" />      I am completely floored and very excited about this, of course.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" /></div>'

Whether or not your child gets a label or not she obviously is having some difficulties which would benefit from the interventions a child with autism or delay.     Have  you researched the methods of ABA and things that you can do at home with her in terms of language building/verbal behavior etc?     There are so many great web sites which provide very useful info on starting up a home program of help.     Here is one which is 150 pages long on verbal behavior. It shows how to \"pull\" words out of our children, words that make sense, words that are accompanied by the childs own understanding  see:http://www.mariposaschool.org/programs/    then look up this page on the site which is where you find the training manual.

He\'s also quite cute, and I\'m proud of the compliments he gets for that as well.     And I\'m proud of his manner in general - always friendly, enthusiastic ..doesn\'t lie, doesn\'t deliberately hurt or insult anyone - he\'s a beautiful person and I\'m sure he always will be.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hey David,    I am sorry that you are upset by what you are reading on the other forum. It can be very hard to get a balance between being upset with something that you feel is hurting a child and allowing a parent to parent their child how they see fit. If you don\'t agree with what a parent is doing to or for their child it is ok to voice it, however if you over react it is quite likely that the other person will over react as well especially if they are emotionally involved.    Can you recognise any feelings before a situation spirals out of control and remove yourself from the thread before it gets to a stage of over reacting?</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">The grieving process in different with Autism then with most conditions.  In most cases you have a course of treatment and it works or it does not.  With most mental Dx you have to learn to accept.  With Autism the outcomes can vary a lot depending on many things.  I don\'t think most of us ever really stop grieving until our children get better.  For me personally there is no other option.  My son will get better and he will get help.  It is also extreamly difficult because most of the Dr\'s you are going to run into will know less then you do.  So first take a deep breath.  You did not do this.  It is not your fault.  We have all done the is it cause I did not breastfeed (I did) still got it.   Is it cause I had a C-Section I did.  Is it a million other things.  No it is just the way the cards fell.  Now you have to decide what is best for your family.  Take baby steps.  Figure out what is currently the biggest issue and start there.  You can do this.  If I can do this anyone can.  Hang in there.  I know the feeling.  My son was not Dx until he was 3 1/2 and had no signs really until he was 3.  I remember the exact moment I realized he had Autism so when we got the Dx I was totally prepaired cause I had already had the shock of realizing he definatly had Autism.  I don\'t think that moment will ever leave me but I can\'t wait for the day that I realize he is better.  We have come a long way and have a long road ahead but it will be ok.</div>'

I already told him i would not push the child support issue if he just pays his half of the biomed and we all know that is not going to happen. I will not suffer thru a court hearing. I guess you can get a divorce packet and supposedly agree to the terms that both parties put forth and then go to the courthouse and it is done.

We are trying... but he\'s so stubborn. </div>  This is so true. My son got agressive from not being able to communicate effectively. My son is 9 1/2 too. I didn\'t see a major fallout (yet!), but when he was just turning 8, we saw aggression increase. I imagine what it would be like to have problems, thoughts and ideas in your head with no way to communicate them to anybody. Even when we try to figure out their needs, I\'m sure we get it wrong a lot of times. My son does have some language, though, so I don\'t want to sound too much like I know what you\'re going through. We have been able to use PECS and a dynavox communication device with my son to increase his verbal language. I don\'t know if you said they tried a communication device with your son, but sounds like you\'ve done quite a lot. Another thing that really helped calm my son is to let him get his own snacks and have more independence around the house. We had to give him more trust and control over his environment. I don\'t know if that is feasible with your son or not. I used to ignore my son\'s aggression, but a new Dr. we saw recently advised me to send my son to his room immediately whenever he had an outburst. That worked. I can imagine, though, when he gets bigger, that might not work at all and I\'ll be powerless to control him. Something else that helps is staying calm when my son isn\'t. When you\'re freaking out and everyone around you is calm, you start to feel wrong. I\'m not sure autistic kids ever feel that way, but it does help the situation, sort of like ignoring. Hope any of this helps a little. I am not looking forward to puberty either.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Parents of Autistic Children Address R-7 Board     By Brett Dalton  The Journal Staff     Two Missouri school districts have been chosen to speak at the Commissioner of Education conference in August to share \"exemplary practices in the area of autism.\"     The Lee\'s Summit R-7 School District is one of those districts, according to information released at Thursday\'s R-7 Board of Education meeting.     At the conference, staff members from the school district will conduct sessions for superintendents and other administrators from throughout the state in order to assist them in serving their autistic population of students.     However, before that news was announced at the board meeting, a group of parents of autistic children addressed the board and expressed their dissatisfaction with how the district provides for autistic children and students with various other special needs.       One of those parents was Sherri Tucker, who lost in her bid to obtain a spot on the board during the April 8 city election.  Tucker received 4,679 votes, just 386 less than Jon Plaas\' 5,065.  Tucker, who has a 14-year-old son with autism, made a couple brief comments, one praising the school district for its work with students without special needs.  The other comment was not as supportive.     \"I think if (the school district) put as much effort into special needs as they do with those (students), then my child would be able to be successful, too,\" said Tucker, co-founder of the Lee\'s Summit Autism Support Group.     Debbie Shaumeyer, who also has an autistic son and helped found the LSASG, told the board she is \"frustrated\" with the education her son receives in the R-7 School District.     \"My husband and I are frustrated with current staff and decisions that are made behind closed doors,\" she said.  \"We are frustrated to sit in the (Individual Education Plane) meetings and decisions about our son are made before we can even sit down as a team.  There is so \"I\" in the word \'team.\'\"     Shaumeyer said the R-7 School District is not adequately staffed to handle special needs students and that she\'d like to see \"changes made in how our tax dollars are spent.\"  She said families are being \"bled dry financially\" due to what she believes to be a lack of proper services in the district.     She also expressed her support for Tucker in last week\'s election.       \"We\'d like to have seen Sherri Tucker elected to the board,\" Shaumeyer told the board.  \"My husband and I wanted Ms. Tucker to win that seat-us, along with 4,000 plus voters.  We are not one, two or three disappointed parents-we are in the thousands.\"     Vanessa Shields, Joyce Lindsey and Christy Burgess also spoke at the meeting about their disapproval with how the school district handles special needs students.     Lindsey and Burgess said their children\'s disabilities worsened as a result of the services they received within the R-7 School District.  Shields, Lindsey and Burgess each said their children with special needs are or will receive their education outside of the R-7 School District.     \"I do not expect any action to be taken because of my comments,\" Burgess said.   \"But it my hope that the board will begin to understand that this is not an individual problem, but a district-wide system failure.\"    Sherri Tucker  Co-Founder Lee\'s Summit Autism Support Group  <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:autism@kc.rr.com\">autism@kc.rr.com</a><!-- e -->  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.lsautism.org\">http://www.lsautism.org</a><!-- m --></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to 15 year old with Early Infantile Autism, Inattentive ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Anxiety Disorder</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to 15 year old with Early Infantile Autism, Inattentive ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Anxiety Disorder</div>'

She gets into these programs every now and again. There are no speach therapist, physio therapist, etc., that work with children anywhere near me.  Also since they say she is not autistic she doesnt qualify for a lot of things.  Also, in my town there are no after school progams for special needs kids.  The only thing we have Marie in after shcool is swimming lessons.  She struggled from the last two years,  but in the past couple of months she has come a long way.  She started paying attention to her instructor and actually trying what she was asked to do.    She has started her third week in school, and she seems to love to go.   Her work is slowly improving, she is at least trying.  Her school friends like her and look out for her. I am watching this closely, making sure this is ok for her.

Ussually he only does it REALLY hard once or twice but it only takes on bad blow, you know?  DO I just ignore it? Is this a normal toddler thing or more of an ASD thing?  He doesn\'t have an official dx yet but EI did just place him in a toddler autism class 4 days a week and I go with him. Today was his first day and he only did this once there and they just picked him up with me and moved him.

' <div class=\"postbody\">My son is 5, he started talking around 2.8, very soon after we started therapy, he is still not fully conversational and scripts occasionally but is a very functional albeit quirky communicator. Think running commentary of everything that\'s going on- this is what we have. We noticed the tendency to memorize sight words before the age of 3, similar to Audrey. For Alex it\'s totally a memory thing, he has a very good memory which is sometimes an obstacle because he tends to fall back on memorized \"right\" answers instead of thinking something through. He also has a thing for numbers and counting.   I\'ve heard parents of hyperlexic children use written prompts to promote conversation, or put labels on things in the house to increase vocabulary etc. It\'s not like we don\'t need all the help we can get <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /> !!  I don\'t know whether this has anything to do with  socialization outside  just the mere autism. It is nice that their pre-K , K will be a little easier from an academic standpoint, and they have more energy to spend on the social obstacles.   I would also like to think that hyperlexia reflects that our children have intelligence, it just takes a lot of rewiring to show it <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />  Alex\'s mom</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">We have had our son, now 7 years old, on the GFCF diet for about 3 years. He used to stim constantly with the TV, hand flapping, tippy toeing. About 2 weeks after getting off the gluten and casein, we noticed the hand flapping diminish, and constant running back and forth through the house on his tip toes stopped. You also have to watch for these behaviors, and be prepared to intervene and redirect. We have since added cod liver oil, and various other vitamins/herb supplements to the diet and he now has no hand flapping, no tip toeing. Stimming is minimal now. Probably the biggest improvement was getting him off the casein/milk products. We use rice milk and it works well.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">If an elementary school music class and Floortime therapy had a baby, it would be Kindermusik. I\'ve written before about what fans we are of this program, but having been through an entire semester now of Family Time, I can be more specific about what is special about Kindermusik -- particularly for kids with special needs.  Kindermusik isn\'t designed specifically for special needs kids; the classes are available for all children from birth to seven years old. But where a traditional, highly structured music class or lesson might be impractical for an autistic child, or a child dealing with any kind of developmental delay, Kindermusik provides a positive, flexible environment, while still encouraging development of real skills through hands-on participation.  We participate in the Family Time class, which has a mix of ages and allows Billy and Willow to interact in the same class. Like Floortime therapy, Kindermusik supports the child-led philosophy. So while the teacher provides a certain amount of structure, with activities and songs selected prior to class, there is plenty of room for individual expression and creativity. From playing with rhythm instruments and scarves to rocking and listening with Mom and Dad, the activities encourage exploration and family bonding.  Take-home materials include CDs with each unit\'s music, a set of rhythm instruments (like egg shakers or wood blocks), copies of the books introduced in each unit, a puppet, a game, and a parent\'s guide with activities you can continue at home to reinforce the new concepts introduced at Kindermusik. Both Billy (age 3 1/2) and Willow (1 year) love and respond to the music. In fact, we hadn\'t originally planned to enroll Willow in the class, but she had such a positive, joyful response after a visit at 6 months that we decided to make Kindermusik true Family Time once a week.  Some of the music may be familiar to you. In our first unit, we worked with versions of &quot;Row, Row, Row Your Boat&quot; and &quot;Ring Around the Rosey.&quot; Our parent\'s guide explained the origins of these songs, which I\'d never known. We also learned new songs like the beautifully restful &quot;Shalom Haverim,&quot; which has become a favorite calm-down song, and &quot;Bubbles on Me,&quot; which Billy sings every time we blow bubbles. There are traditional American folk songs, music from around the world, such as the beautiful Nigerian Boat Song, and original tunes.  Activities during each class include a &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;Goodbye&quot; song, a great way to reinforce social skills, a &quot;Family Jam,&quot; when we all get to grab various instruments and play along with the music, story time, active listening, and a whole lot of various types of movement. We might be asked to listen for a particular phrase in a song, like &quot;Hands all around, Jing Jang,&quot; and when we hear that phrase, we all run together and join hands for a circle dance. We might practice walking slow during the slow beat and jumping fast during the fast beat; or we might wave our scarves up high during the major key and wave them down low during the minor key change. Even if they don\'t undestand the terminology, you\'ll be amazed how quickly children pick up on things like key change and rhythm variations.  When we started the class, Billy mostly ran around and around the room non-stop. Our teacher, Ms. Jaci, taught me to let him be. I learned to follow his lead and bring the music to him if need be. Fairly quickly, he saw the advantage of joining the group and getting his pick of instruments. He loves to try out new rhythm instruments, particularly those that allow him to bang stuff with a stick -- and luckily, there are a lot of those.  All of our jaws dropped one night when he grabbed a wood block and started beating out a complicated, syncopated rhythm in time with the recorded music. He knows every song and poem by heart, and it always makes my heart swell to hear him reciting &quot;Happy Little Me,&quot; which he learned at Kindermusik. He now loves to join the group for circle dances and playing with the parachute, and at the beginning of each class, he grabs all the stuffed animals lined up along the walls and sets them out on the story blanket for the hello song. Because obviously, they need to participate too.  I can only speak to our experience, and I believe we are truly blessed to have a phenomenal teacher in Ms. Jaci who seems to have a magical way with children of all developmental stages, and we have a great place to go in Tallahassee with Good Samaritan Arts (which also offers all kinds of dance and music classes to kids and adults). But the great thing about Kindermusik is that no matter where you are, you can try out a class in your area for free.If you do, I\'d love to hear about your experiences, so please keep in touch!  (I\'m not sure if we can or should post videos here, but if you\'re interested, there\'s a short clip of a &quot;family jam&quot; session from Kindermusik on my website at <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.AmandaBroadfoot.com\">www.AmandaBroadfoot.com</a><!-- w -->.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I can relate to those feelings.  My daughter has been going to preschool for over a year now but I still remember that first night before preschool I was unable to fall asleep.  I would take your child to the preschool a few times before he starts so he can get familiar with the building, the bathroom (if he\'s toilet trained), playground, etc.  Have him meet the teacher for a short time.  Can the teacher  come to your home a few times?  Ours did.  She came to our home to meet our daughter.   We\'re also allowed to drop in during school at any time and we do!  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" />   That gives me a good feeling like they have nothing to hide.    The school gives us a daily communication log which has what she did that day.  It also lists any difficulties she had.  We initial the page and return the book the next day back to the teacher.    We took our daughter a few times to the preschool before she started.  She goes to a typical preschool which has a few special needs kids and not necessarily ASD special needs.  Some just have a speech delay.  Some have physical delays.  I think my daughter is the only one on the spectrum.  The school was already in session for the typical kids so we were able to let her play in the playground, use the bathroom, and generally get a feel for the place.   I think the more familiar a child is with the place the more comfortable he will be when has to go full time.  Our transition went very well.  Hope it goes well for you too.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #800000\">There are many paths to autism.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Whew, I could have written parts of your post. Our Joey did not receive a diagnosis until after age 4 of PDD-NOS. He was speech delayed and flapped his hands at 3 years +, but even the special ed people would not call him autistic. Looking back, they probably just did not want to pay for services, so there was no labeling to be done at that point.    But, all of a sudden, we were being pushed to a developmental ped and all of a sudden, he\'s autistic - with 7 items out of how many on the autism rating scale. I mean, like overnight the same people who said he wasn\'t were now saying he was at least, on the mild end.     And he was also social with good eye contact, somewhat verbal, knew colors, letters, and knew us as his parents, his siblings, his friends, etc. His symptoms didn\'t get worse until almost 4 years anyway, so it was just hard to everyone to tell. The worst, though, was the pediatricians who blamed me, called me crazy, put us on a 2 year wild goose chase w/ his ears and tubes and audiology appts. I mean, they know NOTHING - you have to get to a DAN or someone who specializes. A diagnosis is emotionally hard,  but it\'s your key to getting them services and help.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hey All!              A HUGE thank you to all who have posted and especially chilliwackmom for her specifics.        I have talked to my supervisor several times about this behavior to no avail. In the past when I have tried to address the issue, she has said that the behavior \"just hasn\'t changed in the 5 years the client has been in the program\" and that \"he just targets specific people, especially females.\" It seemed to me that she had given up on the problem and that frustrated me all the more because I felt alone in trying to deal with the behavior.        With your advice, I was a bit more firm and told the supervisor that I believed it our job to assist our participants in leading healthy, productive, and, for lack of a better word \"normal\" lives. I told her that our mission statement includes our promise to strive to do our best to help our participants live like any other person, be they autistic, obsessive compulsive or otherwise. I interpret this, I told her, as in part helping them to become productive members of society. And that means that they need to be able to go out into the community and interact with others.        \"D\" cannot go out into the community and pinch people simply because \"he\'s been doing it for years.\" So, with your help, I was able to use as well as pass on the suggestions I was given. I talked to the program director (my bosses boss) and told her that I believed it was time to meet with the behavior specialist. As it happened, \"D\"s bi-annual Person Centered Plan meeting was coming up the next day! This is where the person in the program, the guardians, the manager, the director, behavior specialist, doctor, psychiatrist and everyone else involved meet to discuss \"D\"s progress and overall health and happiness. The Human Rights rep. was also there which was great. I asked to be included as a member of his support team, giving all the ideas that you all gave me and she said sure!! So, we all sat down and I was able to address the issue with everyone, and get a few personalized tips from professionals, that were also approved by the Human Rights rep. It was the best thing that could\'ve happened.        Everyone was very impressed with my ideas (yours mostly!!!  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /> ) and my desire to better support D in his behaviors and in his life. The behavior specialists and doctors are going to fax us some new programs to run for D, and I think that they will be helpful because of the new insight put into them. I am excited to see D grow even more!!       A happy ending!! Well, beginning I guess!

We have 3 therapists, plus me and provide 21 hours therapy time via therapists and around the clock therapy time with me.     There is no magic number of therapists or hours. I was fooled into this kind of thinking when we used the dtt lovaas script. What matters is that the therapy time either via yourself or with yourselves is used effectively, that you are learning from your child and generalising what he knows and what YOU know about your child into his everyday life.     I am about done with therapists to be honest and just want to continue my boys program on my own, and only have the consultants input. But, that\'s me. I can do a way better job, know my son best and because we use verbal behaviour, it just comes so easy now. Before it was like pulling teeth. Now its just so natural.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Well, what is notable to me is the anonymity of internet boards and the credibility the auto-format gives each post.    You can say some awful, incorrect, or just bad things, but in the nicely typed, evenly spaced, beautifully formatted world of message boards, it looks equal to any other post.  Someone could post a cure for autism and it would not visually look any different than a post about how great drinking draino is.  The internet is like a \"great equalizer.\"    We don\'t know who\'s on the edge, who\'s not who they say they are, nothing.      We are such creatures of the media.  At least I am.  If something is presented prettily, or even seriously, we subconsciously give it some weight.  If someone claims to have a child, and that the child has autism, and that they love the child, etc., I would have no problem assuming all that was true.  When upon reflection, I really have no idea if this is real or not.    I used to hear that anything spoken by someone with a British accent sounds really intelligent.  Well, it does to me!  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />  (Hear that, Respect?)   Kind of the same principle.  The medium certifies the message.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Maybe I\'m dating myself but all that evasiveness kind of reminds me of   EST. Remember EST anyone?  Never attended but ran with a crowd that did that group therapy fad and remember the tremendous buzz about that. People raved about that too but were hardpressed to describe it but if you got \"it\", you were somehow redeemed.    The good thing about getting older is that you start to see patterns in a lot of different scenarios, there is nothing new under the sun but the packaging.    Anyway, I do think Gutstein really and truly gets the autistic mind but I am not convinced that his methods are all it takes, therapeutically speaking of course.    Forgive me ladies, truly not trying to be contentious, but I rather continue on teaching them to play(I feel it does not come naturally), they have to be taught levels of intimacy, taught to  develop their flexibility/imagination and another point is the importance of helping them work through their confusion. Easier said than done and I am still trying to learn how best to accomplish this although Gutstein has made me realize the importance of non-verbal communication.    They are frightened, overwhelmed, disoriented and completely dependent on their primary caregivers as guides to navigate them in a world that makes no sense.  I remember when he was younger I used to deliberately do nonsensical things adding,  \"oh, Mommy got confused, silly Mommy\".  He got to the point that when I legitimately had one of my \"pre-Alzheimer\'s moments\" as I like to call them, he would asked, \"Did you get confused Mommy?\". Now, after biomedicals and diet he is in a stronger place but still regresses on some days, still autistic.  During these days he may get combative, whiny, act younger than his years and I ask him if he feels confused today and many  times he\'ll answer yes.      I really think that has helped him work through it knowing that this is NOT the way he is supposed to feel.  Problem is, the fog has to clear some of the time for it to be effective but even so, they must have an extremely trusting relationship with someone to help them navigate a topsy-turvy world and serve as their interpretor and guide(referencing connection?).  I have noticed lately there has been some trust issues lately and he frequently doubts me saying \"you are lying\" when I make it my business not to lie unless I am pretending and I will always follow up with an \"Mommy is pretending\" when I do.  Anyway, I don\'t know what that\'s about but I\'ll bet it has to do with his inability to make sense of everything all the time or maybe it\'s something NT 5 yr olds say? I wouldn\'t know.     I admit I just have experience with one child, my own, but he has taught me so very, very much and I hope some other parent starting out can benefit from what he has taught me about the autistic mind.    Alex\'s Mom, thank you very much for suggestions on learning more about RDI.  When and if you get the chance, check out Teri Small\'s interviews on autismone. radio.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Respect...I for one applaud you, I don\'t think you have to follow one particular path, in your case ABA in order to see wonderful results in your child.  I for one have taken a very ecclectic approach to my son\'s \"therapy\", I am definately the boss in deciding \"what is best for him\", no-one has the right to tell you what is right for your child, you as the parent get to decide that because you truly know your child better than anyone else and are the only person who can advocate for him from his point of view with no hidden agenda, your role is to look at everything that is presented and make an informed decision about his needs; it sounds like that is exactly what you are doing, you are PARENTING.  There are so many different philosophies of how to give your child the best you can and I think you are on the right path to question whether a chosen methodology is the right choice for you and your child.  I don\'t think you have wasted your year in the program, you learnt alot, you will use the knowledge you have gained when you are parenting you child.  If ABA was right for you, that would be wonderful, but obviously it is not and the only dis-service you would be doing to your child would be to continue down a road that you are not comfortable with.  I wish you luck.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">This is an interesting post for me as my Son just turned 2 and we are still trying to figure out is he has autism or not.  Currently our biggest concern is his language and his tantrums.  He only says a couple words and just the begginging of the word.  Like \"Ba\" for ball, \"ma\" and \"dada\".    We started services at 1 year because he liked to spin objects, would zone out in space, had no separation anxiety and little emotion, laughed for no reason at times, and shook his head, and poor eye contact.  He also did not point or clap.  We took dairy away and started nystatin  and started floor time at 13 months.  At 14 months he started clapping, and pointing at 15months.      At 2 he desires to talk and play with kids, he throws tantrums out of frustration of lack of language.  He\'s has curious play and pretty good eye contact.  We can play back and forth games for up to 10 min. if he\'s interested.  Basically if he\'s healthy he seems typical and if he\'s sick which is 2 weeks out of every month he seems like he has autism red flags.     I truly believe we were on the sure path of autism, but through the grace of God we\'ve been able to probably fight off a diagnosis.  We stopped shots at 8 months because of our concerns.  We still have a fight ahead of us as we constatly work to keep yeast away, interactions going strong and our little boy healthy.      What I would like to know is if there is any other thing than shots, eating organic, ect.  (we do supplements and pray hard) to help us steer clear of regression? thanks</div>'

I\'m having to go back to work full time in September (I\'ve been working part time from home since Luke was a baby) to afford to be able to continue to send him to that school, it has been a big success, but I will miss taking my kids to and from school each day and hanging out with them on school holidays, but right now it is more important that we have the financial means to continue all his therapy and send him to this fabulous school...or perhaps we\'ll win the lottery!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</div>'

So Alex\'s Mom, what was your cutoff criteria for the fat group?    Our cute thing needs a little background... DS used to be deathly afraid of the \"I\'m gonna eat you\" game.  I mean, like last month, he was still afraid.  So I really made a point to teach figurative language and \"jokes\" the best I could.  Now he pretends to eat different body parts on me, then when I ask for them back, he gently opens his mouth and puts it on whatever part of me he supposedly \"ate\" and says \"there ya go.\"    Today at dinner he \"ate\" my shirt.  He laughed so hard when I said \"AAAAAACK, I\'m naked!  I need my shirt!  I can\'t be naked in a restaurant!\"  I think he understood how funny it was that I was saying that while I still really had my shirt on.  That made me so happy.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I just want to say that I can relate to every bit of what you wrote. It\'s been extremely challenging for us here, too. My daughter is 3 and is high functioning but her behavior and gut have always been the big issues. I am a stay at home mom and sometimes I can\'t even get to the grocery store during the day, which seems ridiculous to most people. I get frustrated, feel held hostage, angry, sad, depressed. One thing I found for myself is that being in the caregiver role for such a person creates a lot of stress which alters your zinc/copper levels a lot. I found that taking high doses of Vit C and rutin along with zinc and molybdenum really helped to get zinc/copper ratio better which made me feel a lot more even-keeled.  Then for your son it makes me think he a high ego state (always wanting to get your way) along with overactive stress response (easily set off). The high ego state goes along with adrenal fatigue and the overactive stress response goes along with high cortisol. Different things in the body (yeast, parasites, allergic reaction) can cause the body to chronically secrete cortisol which has the effect of wearing down the adrenal glands and resulting in adrenal fatigue. If this is what is happening in your son, treating the underlying causes of this will help his behavior, as well as giving adrenal support supplements. This is what I find for my daughter over and over again.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Learning to jiggle when shaken.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Learning to jiggle when shaken.</div>'

But they originally hooked us up with the consultant and even invited us to watch some of their sessions for a few days before we got started at home.  I am thinking that is probably going to be a must, I was originally hesitant since it was so far away.  And not only do we have the consultant but the professor at the university I attend that teaches the ABA course (and other special eduction courses) is willing to review video tapes for free to make comments and suggestions, as long as they can be shared with the class.  Privacy is not an issue for us so this will work, he is already receiving therapy at their communications disorders clinic there.    Thank you both for making me feel so much better.

' <div class=\"postbody\"><strong>Jen </strong>- Thank you for your persepctive on ecclectic teaching. My intuition tells me it can\'t be bad, especially if done well, and not just in hopes that something will stick, KWIM? But I know that autistic chidlren learn differently than NT, so it was believable to me at the time.  Nate has been receiving services for nearly 1 year. I had him evaluated by EI at 14 months, and got his diagnosis at 15 months. I credit Early Intervention for his amazing gains, really I am so proud of him. He speaks in 2-3 word phrases and uses lots of action words/verbs, though sometimes does need prompting.    <strong>LMP </strong>- Yeah, but don\'t you ever get sick and tired of playing peek-a-boo with letters and making things jump up and down or slide down a slide?   Nate latest thing is to obsess over the house numbers on every mailbox in the neighborhood. We can\'t take him out in the front yard anymore, and if the livingroom blinds are pulled up, he will stand by the window, look at the mailboxes and talk about numbers. It\'s maddening!  WRT the Pentasa ... we switched to a compounded version last month, after Nate\'s followup scope (everything looked great, much healing has occured in the last 6 months). The new med (mesalamine) supposedly isn\'t as effective, but getting the Pentasa granules into Nate was a major challenge, and I\'m pretty sure he was chewing them too, since he won\'t eat any puree texture food like pudding or applesauce. We were putting the meds in peanut butter and chicken salad, what a mess, and forcing him to eat this stuff 3x per day certainly wasn\'t helping the feeding aversions.  But after 1 month on the mesalamine, it\'s obvious we\'re losing ground. He\'s not eating well again, being really crabby, and waking up in the middle of the night (tho not as bad as before).  We switched back to Pentasa on Friday, so we\'ll see how long it takes for things to balance out again. It\'s been frustrating!

' <div class=\"postbody\">You know, this also brings up a \"philosophical\" problem i have right now regarding suggesting \"best practice\" and best interventions to parents i know. Many of these parents do not have the time and especially do not have the money to engage in a humungous fight with the school boards, or start an ABA program or start biomed, etc etc.     I run a small support group and I give parents information about what I think are the best interventions for autism in the world! Am i encouraging parents to shoot for the stars only for them to be let down by a system that will NEVER accommodate their children\'s needs?    The article i posted outlines the kind of aide i would love to have for my boy in his school. It just aint gonna happen though. Not for a long time, if ever. Where i live ABA is demonised and teacch is the only method of education intervention for autistic children in the \"special schools\". The mainstream schools are totally inadequate for a boy like mine.     So, whilst i am able to fight and have to date, fought successfully to get a program funded in my home, and I have limited funds to engage in biomed, many of those parents i know, cannot, will not, or dont know how to.     So, do i keep the information away from them? Many of them don\'t have computers, and though are fully able to read research papers, dont know where to find them.     Sometimes, by bringing them information which they otherwise would not find, i feel like i am setting them up to fail.     On the other hand, parents need to know what are the best practices. All school boards should be using the best interventions in the world, the best educational practices in the world, not shoving some ridiculous \"theory\" down our throats for lack of anything else. Unless parents know what is \"out there\" they can\'t compare and they cant fight for it.    I have heard parents \"defend\" their children\'s schools when i know for a fact that these schools are far from adequate. The parents say, \"but my child is doing well\". I would really like to \"push\" these parents to prove that their child is doing \"well\", i mean \"compared to what\"? They tend to compare their children to other children in the same class. One parent i know has compared her daughter who now can \"talk\" to a child in the same class who is still  non verbal. So basically she is comparing apples to apples within the confines of an apple barrel.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi,  My son was diagnosed as Autistic by our local Educational Service Agency.  Apart from that, we did not get any diagnosis from any doctor.  He is 7 now.  Lately, he\'s been sleeping only couple of hours every night and wakes up crying while at the same time slapping his face and kicking us.  He sleeps with us every night.  His aggressive behaviours seems to have increased tremondously.    Our family practitioner referred us to behavioural psych division at U of M.  Behavioral division passed us on to Ped psych since they feel that my son\'s self inflicting behaviours are over their protocol.  I then contacted Ped Psych who told me that their evaluation just gets us a diagnosis and not necessarily a treatment.  I then suggested neurological evaluation to which they said there has to be some symptoms to justify neurological issues, for example, headaches, unable to lift the arm, etc.  They added that since sleep deprivation and self inflicting injuries are some of the autism related symptoms, a neurologist has to know what they are looking for...  I\'m so confused.  All I want is a brain scan/MRI, etc to rule out any internal issues that can be fixed...I don\'t know why this sudden change has taken place in my son.  All I know is something is bothering him during the night time for him to cry so hard that his body generates so much heat.  He always seems to be on the run during the day and unfocused. (I did request my family doctor to refer me to a neurologist, but I\'m not certain if this is the route I should go?)    Has anybody gone thru this...?  Should I even bother with the neuro eval?  Should I just locate a DAN doctor and continue with the bio-medical treatment?  Forgive me for the lengthy story -- I haven\'t even narrated half of our story!!!    Thanks for any feedback.

She also is extremely picky eater, likes to spin bowels on the floor, spin in circles herself, walk backwards and constantly holding her ears. She has no form of communication and we have to do everything for her. She is very sensitive to certain sounds and at times does not like to be touched. So this is all still pretty new to me.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Liz77, Thanks for the wonderful recovery story.  Have you been back to that developmental pediatrician. I would love to hear how she would explain going from moderate PDD and metal retardation to an ADHD diagnoisis.  Also right now we hope and pray our son move in the same direction as your son. He is 5 and still has his diagnosis but our developmental pediatrician (not the horrible neurologist that diagnosed him) said that she thinks he will have ADHD or ADD diagnosis.  What biomed treatments worked for you?</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Oh, i am so glad this topic cropped up. I feel so bad for everyone who is having marriage troubles, but at least I dont feel totally alone and isolated in my own now. Misery loves company i suppose. That sounds harsh, but its comforting in a sick kind of way to know there is someone out there who is feeling like i do. Hopefully we can learn from each other and i hope against hope that someone who shares my own difficulties has come away from this thread, feeling just that little bit better.     My husband walked out the door this morning to work leaving me with a parting comment which has rung in my ears all day, you\'re nuts, I hope you have a crappy day and your family is nuts too. He is unbelievably immature, does not have a clue what to do about our autistic son and dosent help out at all with the others either. I have told him to go so many times but i know the only way he is going to go is if i kick him out. He is violent and i am afraid he would do something to me if i did that. I dont want to make this thread a \"dear abbey\" plea, but things have gotten so much worse after our child was diagnosed ASD.     Problem is, and I am sure many moms out there can empathise with this, is that he is the bread winner at the moment. We are so up to our eye balls at the moment that i couldnt carry on with our child\'s therapy if he left. I couldnt cope with no money coming in. Further the thoughts of him leaving and finding some tart to spend money which he should be spending on his autistic son breaks my heart. I couldnt bear it.     so i put up with it. I am a lioness, i have to be. Nobody matters more than my autistic son, at least not right now. We have sacrificed so much so far, i suppose marital bliss is just one more thing i will have to scratch off my \"to do\" list.     Its an awful position to be in and i am sure there are plenty of moms in a far worse position. But they say your own pain is always the worst. Pity our hubbies who are like my own, couldnt wake up to the enormous responsibility, heartache and frustration that we go through to help our precious children. I carry on because my autistic son only has me. God help him if he only had my husband to look after him. I dread to think about it. Its unthinkable really.     I take issue with the poster who said to go to another web forum to talk about marriage issues. This is a biggie, this \"issue\" and is directly related to the stress we are all under. It affects our kids too,probably in ways we will never know. I know each time we argue my little boy is listening and storing it up.     To all the moms and dads out there going through marriage problems, try to keep your eye on the ball, i.e. your beautiful kids. that is what i am trying to do. My personal life, i have come to know, means nothing until i can have my son recovered from autism. Nothing else matters for me till then.     sorry if i depressed anyone. I am not looking for pity, just solidarity.     mom2mom</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I did a lot of study on Ritalin. I can\'t say we will never give Bobby meds. I am so mixed up with everything lately and I would never tell anyone to do or not do something but to inform yourself and make decisions based on as much info as possible.     Here\'s some info I found on Ritalin and the first one gives a list of side effects that could explain some of the symptoms. I know a few neighbors whose children are taking the same stimulant but not that brand and have all said you need to tweak the meds so it\'s always important to talk to the doc when you see negative changes. Please let us know how things go. One more thing.... Our doc (talked to her yesterday, autism specialist at Loyola Hospital in chicagoland area) told us to look at Strattera over the summer. She said she thought stimulants often caused more problems for autistic children than good. Many parents switch meds till they find one that work.

' <div class=\"postbody\">A comment about (good) DAN doctors...  Our DAN did lots of testing, and then based on that testing she recommended things to add in for supplements.  What I\'m getting at here is that if your daughter tests very deficient in vitamin D, or iron, or whatever, it gives something specific --that\'s measurable--to do that will improve your child\'s health.  And ultimately, that\'s what biomed\'s supposed to be about--the concept is that your child is sick, and we need to figure out what\'s wrong, and fix it, and then they\'ll be healthy and no longer autistic.    I agree that I think girls present differently than boys.  Your daughter sounds a LOT like my niece.  Here\'s a pick-up for you--she was a MESS for so many years, and her mom and dad were completely against biomed.  Their doctor said she had PDD and they went to therapy for years that helped very little.  She was on all kinds of adhd meds for years also.  She did eventually develop gut issues, but later in life--maybe around 10 she began with the classic diarrhea and constipation.  Last year, at age 15, they took her off her adhd meds and she is just doing SO WELL.  I am not saying she outgrew it; I don\'t know what\'s going on. But she is much, much better, though not completely normal.  I think that because girls have much better verbal skills naturally, and need interaction with others naturally as well, they are better equipped to use their intellectual skills to learn how to relate to others.  I don\'t know.  But after a very very rough 14+ years, she seems to be coming out of it.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amanda, mom of 3</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amanda, mom of 3</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Superdad. We are in the U.K. as well. I saw your problems with a milk substitute and i posted on this forum about what we use. Its a product called \"tiger milk\". Your local health food shop can order it in for you or you might be able to get a delivery to your own home. We think it is fantastic. there is no soy, no junk and its full of vitamin E. It tastes a lot like milk and my son took to it immediately. I cook with it too, and its fine for custards etc.     Its hard being in the U.K. isnt it. I bet there are persons in your area though, who are just as frustrated as you and would be grateful for a support group. Have you thought of starting one?? I contacted the NAS when my son was first diagnosed but they didnt really offer much remedial help. There is a DAN doctor in Edinburgh i believe and there are a couple of DAN \"rescue angels\" in the U.K. too. One in particular i called who i believe lives in Yorkshire was extremely helpful.     You can get a lot of info over the phone from these people.     first thing i would do i I was you though, would be to get your childs toxic levels tested through a hair analysis, if you havent done this already. I have just found a fantastic site that does this. And they are VERY reasonable, only Â£28.50 for a child and Â£40.00 for an adult. Others were charging 50 and 70 for a child.     their website is: <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.foresight-preconception.org.uk\">www.foresight-preconception.org.uk</a><!-- w -->.

They are also very helpful on the phone:  01243 868001    hope that helps. any help you want about U.K. autism let me know and i will try and help.   respect</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Ricky\'s Mom,    Under IDEA, a federal law, a child who has been identified as a child with a developmental disablility is entitled to a FAPE and this is NOT contingent upon a diagnosis of any sort, only an educational classificational in the case of school aged children .  By not making the request in writing, there is no paper trail. This is your first mistake.  Request an immediate eval, in writing to psychologist and cc to director of school district, going on up the line, cc ing to mayor or superintendent of schools if you have to.  You may want to leave out any explanation of dx for now as it may or may not work vs you. I\'d leave it out for now until you get the 411 on what services are offered for a particular classification. Autism is but one classification. Under IDEA, a child receives an IEP and services.  If the evaluation is not accurate  in your estimation, does  not state there is a sufficent delay, request an independent evaluation to be paid for at district expense.      Under Section 504, your child must have an actual diagnosis and then a 504 plan, no IEP is implemented.  Some people take advantage of this law to keep a child out of Special Education while still providing special accomodations like extra time for test-taking for their ADHD child.    Your child may benefit from the latter as it seems that his cognitive abilities are superior.  Developmentally delayed in what areas? Social, emotional besides fine motor?  Find out what the criteria is for dev delayed in your state as I believe it may vary from state to state. At  least one year behind in one area or 6 months behind in 2 areas? Very important.  You can also take advantage of 504 since he already has a dx but I do not know how to get ball rolling on 504 other than making any and all requests in writing to school board.    On a more personal note, you mention that he does typical Kindy stuff?  Are you kidding me?  Mine is not in kindergarten yet, is it typical to count in fives and tens to the ten thousands?  I admit I don\'t exactly know what typical kindergarten goals are. Mine is being homeschooled this year (almost 5) and would be very interested to know.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Jeffrey\'s mom-  Ditto about the feelings of guilt, not sending in tapes, making excuses etc. This Eric person sounds like he really knows what he is talking about !   I am pretty intimidated every time I browse the Mid-Atlantic files and I must say that I sort of envy those parents\' sense of discipline with RDI. I wish there was another listserve for RDI-lite for Dummies, where I personally would feel more at home.    MCA-  I think you pinned down very well some of the problems with implementing a successfull RDI program. I agree with you that Gutstein has some really great points,and after hearing him speak, I have come to look at my son\'s autism in a different way. I particularly like the way he defines autism, as a difficulty in developing dynamic intelligence and a fundamental deficit in information processing. To a large extent a lot of the isolated delays that we are addressing (speech, understanding, socializing, play etc) are part of this global problem. It\'s pretty disheartening too, that (at least in our case) working on those issues hasn\'t remedied the autism per se and in some ways has even made it more obvious (even though his general functioning and our equilibrium as a family have certainly improved a lot).  Something I\'ve noticed about RDI is that one must navigate a phenomenal maze of marketing blurbs to cut to the chase. When I first watched the tape I was in awe at how many words that man could use for something that could be said in a fraction of the time. I had the same feeling at the 4-day seminar, only he was very entertaining in person, so I really didn\'t mind. A lot of semantic hair splitting and ABA-bashing that were unnecessary IMO. But please don\'t get me wrong, I would encourage anyone interested in RDI to try to hear the man speak in person, it really opens a new perspective.  The other issue I have is that G presents RDI as the \"it\" therapy (though skillfully leaves the door open for \"treating comorbidities\"- which for some kids may be huge issues). He is focusing a lot now on the benefits of RDI for even \"lower functioning\" kids (I hate that term BTW because it doesn\'t mean much, but this is how it came up in several discussions)- and I think it\'s because the RDI program to date is largely embraced by parents of more HF kids. I am not convinced that RDI alone does as much as he claims for very early learners (though some RDI principles are certainly helpful at any level) who may need a lot of cognitive and behavioral catch-up therapy before focusing on relationships.  The light that went off in my head after the RDI seminar was understanding why my son is plateauing. After a certain point, when the kids are able to get all their needs met (getting what they want, expressing what they want, asking for the desired information, understanding what\'s going on around them, having fun) there is VERY LITTLE motivation to take it to the next level. Like G says, the \"why bother\" is lacking. I feel that, at least for my son (and I\'m sure he isn\'t the only one), this needs to be addressed separately. Maybe some other kids naturally close this gap or maybe their parents instinctively know how to help them reach that point, or maybe that part of their brain wasn\'t affected- who knows. RDI attempts to shift the focus on the value of the interaction and establishing positive memories of competence, rather than emphasizing the instrumental end-point of an activity.   G is constantly changing and finetuning the program, and there is a huge number of skills and functions, so it\'s not a very user-friendly program to do on your own without some guidance. I\'m wondering if it\'s truly that complicated (typical development is complicated too, parents just take it for granted I guess), or if he is just adding fluff to keep it all centralized at the Connection Center and their trained consultants. I don\'t know. There is a big business side to it, even if this doesn\'t take away from the value of the intervention.     Alex\'s mom</div>'

Because he\'s older, ask about allowing him to use a computer in class. He can take notes on it and complete in class assignments. If they won\'t allow a computer, ask for a scribe for tests (or tests that allow him to respond in an alternate format, like multiple choice instead of short answer or essay) or how he can get a copy of class notes instead.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Alex\'s mom, you are right about teachers not switching out mastered file folders and tasks - we found that to be an issue as well.      For us, starting out with an independent work center and a visual schedule ultimately helped Jack in an inclusive school environment.  We have since been able to fade the visual schedules.  The independent work station has taught him how to stay on task in an inclusive school environment (longer than his NT peers BTW) without adult prompting.  A year ago my son was tantruming in the corner for the first hour of school. He was distressed being there and on a couple occassions he bit a peer, it was heartbreaking and I almost pulled him from school.  We implemented some programs here at home to make him more successful at school, introduced a schedule and a workstation (filled with the types of activities he\'d do at centers when at school) and now he knows what to expect at school and is doing very well.  He\'s interacting with other kids without the facilitation of an aide, he shares toys and food, he\'s excited to go to school in the mornings, he loves it when the other girls build blocks on his belly (a child who 1yr ago wouldn\'t let a peer touch him), he sits for circle time, copies his peers when they do the hand movements for songs - he\'s really a different kid.  I feel like having the structure in place and teaching him what to expect at school allowed him to really enjoy school.    LMP - you\'ve probably already seen this but here\'s a letter from the Division TEACCH website:    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">What is TEACCH?   Frequently statements are made that misrepresent our TEACCH approach. \"TEACCH does not allow Occupational Therapy\", \"TEACCH has low expectations\", or \"TEACCH does not believe in inclusion\", people will say emphatically. Our TEACCH approach is quite different and much more flexible than any of these false descriptions would suggest. This short statement is designed to present the major priorities of the TEACCH approach.  Developed in the early 1970\'s by our founder, Eric Schopler, the TEACCH approach includes a focus on the person with autism and the development of a program around this person\'s skills, interests, and needs. The major priorities include centering on the individual, understanding autism, adopting appropriate adaptations, and a broadly-based intervention strategy building on existing skills and interests. By focusing on the individual we mean that the person is the priority, rather than any philosophical notion like inclusion, discrete trial training, facilitated communication, etc. We emphasize individualized assessment to understand the individual better and also \"the culture of autism,\" suggesting that people with autism are part of a distinctive group with common characteristics that are different, but not necessarily inferior, to the rest of us. Emphasizing assessment and the culture of autism requires us to understand people with autism as they are and to build our programs around where each person is functioning. This does not suggest lower or higher expectations; it simply requires starting where people are and helping them to develop as far as they can go. This is different from espousing a model of \"normal\" behavior for everyone and requiring people with autism to fit into that mold, whether that is comfortable for them or not.  Structured teaching is an important priority because of the TEACCH research and experience that structure fits the \"culture of autism\" more effectively than any other techniques we have observed. Organizing the physical environment, developing schedules and work systems, making expectations clear and explicit, and using visual materials have been effective ways of developing skills and allowing people with autism to use these skills independently of direct adult prompting and cueing. These priorities are especially important for students with autism who are frequently held back by their inability to work independently in a variety of situations. Structured teaching says nothing about where people with autism should be educated; this is a decision based on the skills and needs of each individual student. Some can work effectively and benefit from regular educational programs, while others will need special classrooms for part or all of the day where the physical environment, curriculum, and personnel can be organized and manipulated to reflect individual needs.  Cultivating strengths and interests, rather than drilling solely on deficits, is another important priority. Obviously any program working with handicapped people has to maintain a balance between developing skills and remediating deficits. In this sense TEACCH is no different from any other program. On the other hand, most programs dealing with developmental disabilities emphasize remediating deficits and focus their entire efforts on that goal. Our approach, respecting the \"culture of autism,\" recognized that the differences between people with autism and other can sometimes favor people with autism. Their relative strengths in visual skills, recognizing details, and memory, among other areas, can become the basis of successful adult functioning. TEACCH has also observed that capitalizing on their interests, even though they might be peculiar from our perspective, helps increase their motivation and understanding of what they are doing. These strategies enhance efforts to work positively and productively with these people, rather than coercing and forcing them in directions that do not interest them and that they cannot comprehend.  The TEACCH approach is also broad-based, taking into account all aspects of the lives of people with autism and their families. Although independent work skills are emphasized, it is also recognized that life is not all work and that communication, social and leisure skills can be learned by people with autism and can have an important impact on their well-being. An important part of any TEACCH curriculum is developing communication skills, pursuing social and leisure interests, and encouraging people with autism to pursue more of these opportunities.  In addition to these techniques of understanding autism, developing appropriate structures, promoting independent work skills, emphasizing strengths and interests and fostering communication, social and leisure outlets, the TEACCH approach is most successfully implemented on a systems level. Based on the concept that coordination and integration over time is as important as consistency within a given situation, the TEACCH approach is most effective when it is applied across age groups and agencies. Frequently professionals obsess over maintaining a consistent environment from day to day, but then a child jumps from technique to technique when changing settings over time. Division TEACCH believes that the interests of people with autism are best served with coordinated and cooperative programming based on consistent principles over a life time. Therefore, we try to maintain continuity in our approach while integrating new ideas slowly and only after they have proven effective. Our TEACCH principles, developed in 1974, have stood the test of time; adults brought up using those practices are now the most productive and successful in the world with lives that are full, rich, and meaningful.

' <div class=\"postbody\">We taught him to stay an arm\'s legnth away from his peers, unless it\'s a close friend.  Then he should ask first before hugging.  This took several months and still requires reminders.  Before he started kindergarten, we drummed on and on about asking before hugging teachers.  S. is a very affectionate kid.  Oddly, he understands the dubious social norm about guys not hugging, he will not hug men, except his dad.  He rarely hugs his male friends and just recently stopped hugging his girl friends.  But, still tries to hug his teachers, but does usually ask first.    The personal space issue is not limited to kids with ASD at least in Kindergarten and 1st grade.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello!  My sons speech therapist just got this e-mail, so I thought I would pass it along:    Autism Friends and Community,    We in the autism community need to get our kids (young and old) signed up for the PUNS database (Prioritization of Unmet Need for Services) so they can start getting services from the state.  We are working hard to get a childrens waiver set up and next year is the adult waiver renewal.  no one gets services in Illinois unless they are on the PUNS database, and currently only 400 or so kids with autism are listed there, even though there are more than 8000 counted by the schools (and even that\'s an under count).  the adults are counted in higher numbers, but we don\'t know how many are out there, so likely they are vastly undercounted as well.    Below is an idea for you to run past your local PAS agencies: sponsor a night at a local school to allow parents to get signed up, after work hours.  Call you ISC/PAS agency and run the idea past them.  If they are not open to the idea let the Autism Society of Illinois know and they will try too.  We\'re thinking of setting them up in April (Autism Awareness Month) and we need your help to get your local groups involved.    We need everyone on this database ASAP, and this seems like a great way to get people to do it.  Please do whatever you can to set this up and encourage people to get on that database.      Thanks  Autism Society of Illinois        I\'ve got a list of all of the Service Coordination agencies and their phone numbers so if you are not sure of yours and you want on this list just let me know.  I didn\'t even know this existed and I am currently working with my local agency to plan a sign up night.  This could be great for everyone.  It\'s going to allow more services for our kids and at little or no cost. Anyhoo...just thought this was something to get the word out about    Proudmom of Bryce</div>'

I think I am remembering this right, it was several years ago and we were not able to get too involved, so I am quite limited in my knowledge.  It is a credible therapy and if I could get involved with it again, I would!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Dana</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Dana</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">The logic for the 1 hour of group speech my son was offered in 3 20 minute sessions over a week on various days was that that was all he needed to achieve the goals as I had approved them.      LMP at least where I live, not just my city but around this part of the state, it\'s kind of a given that you have to give your child private speech because school district speech is not up to par or enough.  (I apologize profusely to any good SLT\'s or SLP\'s out there but this is the deal here.)  If it\'s the same where you are, no matter what you get from the SD, you\'re still going to have to supplement anyway... so if POSSIBLE that would be a potential comprimise point on your end.  Even though I realize it\'s totally <em>not </em>and it\'s like one of the <em>most </em>important things on your end in reality.  But you may just have to resign yourself to funding some private speech.  I hope not, I\'m sure it\'s not that way everywhere.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">This all happened so quickly, and Im still trying to figure out what\'s going on.   Just as a warning this is going to be a long post.   when my son Kade, was about 2 my mom told me that my family has been talking and they thought that Kade was autisic (one of my aunts is a social worker so im guessing she started it).  At first I was angry that they were talking about him behind my back and thought they were dead wrong, so what that he still used jargen, and spent the entire time at family get togethers running, and learned things differently.  He couldn\'t been autisic.  He\'s the most happiest kid I know, he\'s very social, will try to talk(using jargen) with anyone who makes eye contact with him.   Well I eventually looked on the internet for the warning signs just to prove everyone wrong and was shocked.  He\'s next well-child visit was with the other dr in the office because his was on a long maternity leave (triplets, and i though 1 baby was rough ouch) mentioned it, and he referred me to the early intravention program.  They couldn\'t dx autism yet, but signed him up for speech, developmental, and OT.  A speech therapist wasn\'t available until nearly the end of the program.  His progress was very dissapointing, knowing the frustration i had to put up with.  He pretty much learned circles, horizontal and vertical lines and maybe 5 words. But unfotunately learned a few bad habits from them as well.  The OT was supposed to help him with some of his sensory issues, and transitions which was the big thing he really really needed.  He will have a separation anxiety like reactions when the pizza delivery guy leaves.  He never never never wants his current activity to end.  She taught him a balance ball thing that he enjoys, taught him to be slightly more tolerant to sticky items.  But she never helped with his oral stims needs, his intolerance of grooming, and her idea of helping him deal with transitions was to loan him a toy so her leaving would be less tramatic for him.  Now he thinks he can just borrow toys from everywhere he goes.    well anyways when he got close to 3 they set him up for an eval at the childrens hospital for autism, and also with the school system for starting preschool there.  And literally within a span of 1 week we left early from the early intravention program, had evals for preschool, started preschool 2 weeks early and dx for autism.      Even the dx is kinda confusing, the eval was 2 hours long, kade wasn\'t really interested in doing alot of the tasks she wanted him to do, but did luckily show alot of his traits that were of concern.  at the end he was really frustrated and wanted to go home, so she said she had seen and heard from us enough for now.  At the eval she called it \"autisic behaviors\"  and explained to me that it takes an entire team to dx autism and that he really did have enough skills to do a proper eval (?)  That she recommends I sign him up for headstart (devlopmental preschool) for the maximum ammount of time.  she gave me a bunch of pamplets, exerpts from books, web links, and book reccommendations, then sent me on my way.  The very next day Was my meeting to see if he qualified for headstart and IEP.  They ended up wanting to come to school 4-5 days anyways (the kids get 2 fridays off a month for teacher planning).  The psycologist couldn\'t make it to the meeting.  the ot wasn\'t available for the initial eval but said she would do one at school after he was given time to adjust.  A few weeks later I got the copy a the report from the hospital and she said that he did meet the criteria for ASD which is kinda confusing to me since at the eval she called it \"autisic behaviors\"  gave me a few more pamplets and that\'s it.  At his well-child visit then his usuall ped was on sick leave and I asked the other dr about it, and I think he was even more stumped them me.  He told me it was up to the school,  and when I asked about the tested used to dx the cause, he said he wouldn\'t even know what to do, they apparently didn\'t get the report yet, luckily I brought mine.  for the labs he copied it straight from the report.  I think he\'s the first autism case he\'s ever had.  They recommended a more thourogh eval for autism when he turns for.  And that\'s pretty much it.    There was like 5 people at the IEP meeting most of which I was meeting for the first time. and they were all talking to each other I was just trying to keep up and keep track of my boys because I had no babysitter that day.  I dont even know who I would talk to right now, for anything.    He\'s in a devlopmental preschool with kids of various ranges I think he is the only autisic kid there (i live in a small town, but they have been trained to work with autisic children).  for part of the day they are in class with NT.  They tell me he\'s doing fine, but a few people have let it slip that he\'s having a hard time adjusting.  He receives 20 min of speech therapy 2x a week.  Im still waiting on the results for his OT eval.   since school his frustration tolerance has not been good.   everything upsets him now.  and he is soo tired when he comes home from school.  He usually just goes straight to bed.  He\'s picking up alot of words, most is just parroting, but least he\'s trying which he wasn\'t before.    And well I really dont know where or what to do next.  the closest ABA and DAN drs are quite a drive away and im not even sure if those are right for him yet.  I have probably 30+ websites i\'ve looked at, and 3 pages front and back of reccomended books to read.  and i\'m overwhelmed, I have no clue where to go, who to talk to where to start, or even if i should sign him up for more, he\'s so tired when he comes home from school and so intolerant of stress makes me think that he\'s at his limit, but im afraid of not doing enough.  Everything I read isnt\' sticking it seems.  It seems like ever since was born everyone never took me seriously that something wasn\'t right, i\'ve always been given excuses and which i admit myself some of which we\'re valid.  I feel like everyone seems to be delaying everything or sending me to someone else.  The sorta local asd support grp doesn\'t meet for another 6 weeks.  I plan on making another appt and try to get his ped. to ask questions soon.  I had done some reading before and everyone else seemed to get recommendations for various treatments and such and I got nothing but a large list of recommended reading.  I have no clue where to go from here.      one helpful thing if there was 1 book you could recommend as being for being a good first book what would it be?  something that expains my options and a sorta crash course in all the treatments to help me choose which one(s) would be best for my son.    thanks for any help</div>'

We try not to let him out of our site much in public, he is just not ready yet.  Instead, I would let him purchase something in store, ask for change and carry light shopping bag himself.  We live in the city, so he pays for a subway or bus and uses metro card while I follow behind a few steps.  If we are in amuzement park, I give him money and let him pick rides and pay for them.  I think it helps him to get used to the busy world around him safely and maybe in a year or so, we will give him a little more independence.  He starts kindergarten this year and we not using the school bus, because there are going to be some older kids, (from 8th grade), on it and I worry about that .</div>'

He almost never cries, and even if for some reason he does the cloud blows over in minutes. Nothing like this. I couldn\'t figure it out and he can\'t tell me so I will go with my best guess: the teacher used an in-room microwave for the first time in DS\'s presence, and I\'m betting it has a loud fan.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I read the entire website when it was first posted a couple of nights ago, and I had to really sit and think about it.  I was at first saddened by the pictures and the website, but as I got to the end and realized that she was happy; I really thought that that is all that mattered.      And it reminded me of a conversation I had with a friend a few months ago.  She asked me what if none of the biomed or diet or the tons of time I sit asking him to say mama, what if none of it worked?  I automatically responded with an analogy of parents of a child with cancer.  You may come to terms that they may die at a young age like the doctors are telling you, but that doesn\'t mean that they give up hope or trying anything in there power to save them.  Basically, coming to terms with what could happen doesn\'t mean you give up fighting the good fight.  I told her that if JW recovered, fantastic, if he was at least functioning, still that was great, and if he was severe and needed twenty four care, it made no difference.  As long as he is happy with who he is then I am happy, but that does not mean I will quit trying.  I want to give him the best shot at a normal life that I can, and if it doesn\'t work, oh well,  I will love him just the same.  And the only thing I want for my son is for him to be happy.    My son is sick and he needs medical care, just like a child with cancer would.  And just because it might not help the outcome in the long run, I will not deny him the chance that it might work.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I have a huge problem with this as well.  First, it is in my opinion the parents decision what kind of behavioral intervention is to be used.  Second, when you give teachers and staff the permission to use restraints, how are you to know that the teacher is no using them just to keep the child under control, I think it gives the school system way to much power, and unless a parent is present, we are forced to believe what the school tells us.  And everyone will have a different perception of what is dangerous behavior, so while one teacher may not be able to handle the very mild outburst and use restraints, another might use restraints when the child is simply non compliant, and another may use them when the child is truly out of control.  BUT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shouldn\'t the goal of the staff be addressing the problem the child is having as opposed to just holding them down or locking them up?</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Does your son sleep well?  I ask this specifically because my son did a LOT of headbanging when he was 2-3 years old.  He did not sleep more than 3-4 hours a night at the time, and I finally put him on melatonin to help.  Once he started sleeping, the banging stopped.  My layman\'s theory was that he was not getting any REM sleep, and that he was so exhausted he resorted to headbanging out of frustration. Very sad time for all of us.  When he started sleeping well, a lot of his stimming stopped.  When he WAS headbanging, nothing seemed to help.  We tried the massage, but he was too far gone to notice.  I got to the point that I would just put a pillow or a blanket under him so that he couldn\'t hurt himself (as much.)</div>'

I may end up being the one who needs a sedative, but I know we have to go through with this.  DS has made so much progress in the past few months, I feel like we\'ve put a huge dent in this thing.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Wow, this post is really interesting, all the different angles and opinions.  My eldest boy Dominic is NT, but extremely bright, possibly gifted, I have considered getting him tested a couple of times, he was bright right from the get to, and academics are a breeze for him, Every report card from school is a masterpice that if I could laminate and show to everyone without getting punched by someone I probably would.  Whenever I have been asked about Luke\'s sibling from a professional who is involved with Luke we will invariably discuss whether Dominic could have Asperger\'s, and each time I go off and research it alittle and then observe him, but every time I just see a bright boy who is perhaps not especially popular, but that does not mean that he has social impairment,  No, he\'s got friends, he has playdates that go well, he needs no support or extra supervision nor facilitation of social interaction, but what it does mean is that he is not the most popular kid in the classroom, he has friends, he has no sensory issues, is able to maintain self control and not tantrum or behave inappropriately, he is very intelligent and most likely 95% of the kids in the classroom are just not that interesting to him, he can\'t wait for grade 4 when a plethora of extra curricular academics and arts are available to him: drama, choir, challenge programs etc.    A DX is only worth getting if the child will benefit from it.  Originally when we first tested Luke we were told he had a developmental delay....can\'t do much with that, very little services for that, no funding for that.  When we went back 9 months later for a second test and got the autism DX we had mixed feelings, but on the whole now I am alittle hesitant about him ever losing his dx, I would love for him to be \"cured\", but if he has any issues and keeping his dx will help him continue to get services then I\'m happy for him to keep it.  This is also a learning experience and as time goes by I may very well change or at least challenge my opinions and views.  I think it depends on where the child is on the spectrum, what services are available in the area you live in and how the dx or lack thereof will effect that child/adult in the long run.  At our stage we just want funding and services to help him, when he is 11, 16, 21 it may be that we want him to have support so keep a dx, or we may find that he has more opportunity with no dx.  At the moment it is the least of my concerns, he\'s 5 years old, who knows what he can achieve, I\'m hoping for alot now that I have discovered Bio Med.  Is there a link between autism and giftedness? If we\'re polling on opinions though, I\'d throw my vote in with the \"there is a link\".  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclamation\" /></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\">Eden wrote:</div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Hi Parents, and all  I went to school yesterda morning and have a talk with his teacher. I asked them what really happened. They said he has been non-compliant almost the whole week and that Friday he was on a net swing in the classroom. They use that as a reward, he requested a swing and they let him swing for about 3 monutes, then prompt him to table work. He refused to get off the swing, and started tantruming, falling on the floor. Mind you, my son never ever had tantrums at school, and even if at times, (especially when we do the yeast protocol, due to yeast die off, he could be a little hard headed and a bit aggressive, not violent, he is only 4) on top of that the swing is not new to him, he has been on it million times the whole last year and half. So i asked them what they did, i asked them to show me what they did on my self. I lie down on the floor and asked them to do the exact same thing they did. His teacher said she has to call the autism specialist and she can do it better. But i said the autism specialist wasn\'t in the classroom when this occured. Anyways she was called and she was telling me that in Montgomery county if a child is in danger of self injury, they can do a physical intervention as an emergency and they also can do restrain, seclusion.......It applies to all kids. I asked her if it\'s a proper way to do so for a 4 year old child. She said \'as long as they do it in the right way\' So i lay down (on my suit, i was on my way to work  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /> ) then they cross mylegs and bend them upso they rest on top of my butt, they lay my arms behind me and another teacher put pressure on my hands. So basically, one teacher put pressure on my crossed legs from behind, and another one by my shoulder. I was boiling inside and i felt like flipping over and so some karate. I told them he is way too young for that and i have never sighned a consent form so that this kind of restrain can be used. If a child is removed from a favourite activity and put on restain sounds danger to me.   Anyways i requested an emergency IEP and told them that i would like to discuss this issue on the meeting, i also asked a behavior assesment to be done right away and if data can be taken.   This morning i added few things on the letter. It\'s basically ano consent form,  in the letter i make it vey clear that i have not and will not authorize and will not consent to any activity that involes the use of restrictive procedures, time out, physical management, restains, seclusion........at school or while my son is transported to or from school. I mentioned that the IDEA creates a presumption in favor of positive methods, requriing an IEP team to consider using positive behavior interventions and strategies when addressing a child behavioral concerns. If the school think my son\'s behavior is so challenging, then they need to do an assessment asap and i will participate in this assessment and the development of a PBS plan for mychild.   It\'s edited and ready to be mailed, please feel free to let me know if it sounds harsh, or if i\'m overreacting. I really like to hear what you parents think of my actions.  Thanks so much.  Eden</div>  have you seen the reports of children and adults dying from this very restraining procedure?????     the positioning and the anxiety of being restrained puts the person into cardiac arrest. search it here and on other sites, there are many police dept now not using this method b/c of the distress and possible death of the person. there has to be a better way to handle a tantrum which are usually on the floor flailing not attcking anyone plus there are other holds that can be used that do not put the person in harms way of this cardiac arrest in conjunction to that procedure. personally my child would not be going to this school ever again but if they take your letters and such and apply them to change and you are happy with the teacher and school in other ways then it may be able to work out yet if they dont understand the complex issues surrounding autism and behaviors with the transitioning  hardships then that would concern me also that the specialist is not training the staff and having stategies in place to deal with the things that will come up even though they may not have before. use your mommy instincts on this one they wont steer you wrong.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Lisalynn  keeping hope and faith through it all.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Lisalynn  keeping hope and faith through it all.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Dear Kim,    I want to give you \"props\" for coming here and asking, because you could have just blown it off, but you are doing some research and that is fantastic.  I hope any teacher that gets my son in class asks questions like you are instead of getting angry or blowing him off.    I\'m puzzled, though, by what happened.  There has to be more to the story and I\'m going to wager that there is, but since you are new to working with kids with autism it was not immediately apparant to you.    The lunging is not acceptable, BUT... BUT... BUT... don\'t necessarily interpret it as disrespect.  It\'s important that when you work with kids with autism that you don\'t ascribe motives to their behavior that might not be what\'s truly driving them to do what they do.  There are a lot of issues a child with autism might be dealing with... speech issues, sensory processing issues (not feeling things the way you do, etc.), even biological issues or medical ones like acute stomach distress, which is common to many of our kids.    I would wager the parents told her she didn\'t do anything wrong because they saw the situation escalating and just wanted to avoid a bigger problem.  It\'s not as easy as saying \"honey, don\'t do that.\"  Once the child starts to \"escalate\" or the tantrum/meltdown begins, it\'s kind of like a snowball effect.  I am sure no parent would think it was OK to lunge at a teacher, but there may have been a larger issue he was trying to address and he needed to calm her to do it.    You do need to find out more about these kids, don\'t they have IEP\'s?  Why would a child with autism... who would lunge at a teacher... be in your classroom and you completely unprepared for it, with NO modifications or training?  I find this odd and unfair not only to you, but absolutely to the 2 girls.  Why were the parents of the one girl still there?    It seems to me that 5th graders are young enough where a child not in uniform would not create too much of a stir, no?  In order for her to participate?  However, such arrangements would need to be discussed with you beforehand and explained to the rest of the squad so the other girls don\'t feel like they are treated unfairly.  I don\'t think the parents should have shown up to the game with her not in uniform and expected her to be part of things.  HOWEVER, was this the first game of the season?  In which case, I\'d show some flexibility.      But do try to think of some \"flexibility\" you could show to include these 2 girls.  In the grand scheme of things... <em>the right and wrong scheme of this world</em>... it\'s a lot more important to include everyone, particularly those who are struggling, than it is to have a flashy and outwardly perfect cheer line.    I hope you find some assistance; you don\'t deserve to be attacked and the 2 girls deserve to be given appropriate access to what all the other kids are doing.  It doesn\'t sound like anything\'s in place to protect either of you.  That\'s the fault of your administrators.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I\'m fairly new to this site but this one reallly hit me.  My son is older (now 14) and I feel like I\'ve been there, bought the T-shirt, the bumper sticker, etc.      My son is a joy but that \'gap\' between him and all those NTs out there is considerable and gets wider all the time.  He doesn\'t have any friends who come over, or invite him over, and hasn\'t since about 2nd grade <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /> .  His communication skills are limited and he simply doesn\'t enjoy doing what most other boys his age enjoy.  TV/DVDs/movies are primarily Disney and he can recite entire movie scripts but can\'t actually follow the conversations (comprehension is lacking). He isn\'t interested in sports either as a participant or as a fan.  He is almost always very happy at home with us and his movies, and he has his weekly routine, but has almost nothing going on outside of the immediate family.  And yes, especially during those elementary years, I tried all kinds of things to see if something clicked with him and others/outside interests...but nothing worked.    Right now he\'s happy, cheerful, and very loving, but adulthood is looming out there and many of my wishes, hopes, maybe even fantasies, of his future possibilities have definitely changed over time.  I too kept thinking that we\'d find a therapy or treatment that would help him make that giant communication/social leap.  But he\'s had good, steady progress and is SOOOOO much better than he was back at age 5 and 6.      However, I also look ahead with some concern, and even fear, at what\'s ahead for him.  My current hope is that he will find a way to be at least semi-independent and continue to be happy.  So I also have had my \'basketball\' moments when my dreams and hopes for him have needed to be revised.  I don\'t think any of us see that as giving up...more as needing to take another route.    I don\'t know - right now this feels like I\'m really rambling.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I hope that I haven\'t posted this before.  If so, I am sorry, but I really think that it explains so much.    They think Brianâ€™s school problems are my fault. When I said he needed more individual help from the LD teacher, they shook their heads. They only \"do collaborative\" now. They told me I shouldnâ€™t use the word \"dyslexia\" because it sounds hopeless. Then they asked how my husband and I wre getting along! (Denise, mother of a boy diagnosed with emotional problems, later found to have severe dyslexia.)   The school psychologist said Shannon\'s learning problems were her fault, that she was lazy and unmotivated and we had to pressure her to work harder. We didnâ€™t allow her to watch television. We didn\'t allow her to go out with friends. Homework took hours to complete, even when we helped her. She got terribly depressed. We didnâ€™t know what to do. We didnâ€™t want to raise a lazy child. (Emory &amp; Elaine Carter before they learned Shannon had dyslexia and ADHD. See Florence County School District Four v. Shannon Carter, 510 U.S. 7, (1993)).     The Blame Game  Parents of special ed kids often say that they are intimidated, patronized and made to feel guilty and inadequate by staff at their childrenâ€™s school. These parents feel helpless, frustrated, and defensive. Not surprisingly, parents behave exactly like other human beings when they are blamed or attacked. Feeling threatened and uncomfortable, most parents try to explain and justify their position, in hopes that they will be understood. A few go on the offense, firing volleys of blame back. Many parents find these experiences exquisitely painful and humiliating. If they withdraw and try to avoid school functions, they find that they\'ve been labeled as \"uninvolved parents.\" Again, they are blamed for their childrenâ€™s learning problems.     Sometimes, emotions get out of control. Feelings of anger, bitterness, and betrayal consume parents and school personnel - who are then unable to work together to make educational decisions. In these cases, everyone loses. The child is usually the biggest loser if the parents and educators cannot work together effectively.     What is the basis for these negative experiences? Are parents too sensitive? Do they misperceive and misunderstand what happens in their contacts with educators? Or are parents just over-protective of their children, as many educators claim?     If you are a \"special ed\" parent, you know that it\'s hard to fight - and almost impossible to bail out. If your child receives special education services, you have to attend school meetings and you have to cooperate in developing your childâ€™s IEPs. How can you do this?     And here\'s another question: If the school staff believes that you or your child are responsible for your childâ€™s problems, how can you work with them so your childâ€™s interests are protected? How can you ensure that your child gets a good quality education?     School Culture  If you have run into a \"brick wall\" of resistance when you tried to obtain changes in your childâ€™s educational program, you need to understand how schools really work. You need to learn about \"school culture\" and the beliefs held by many educators, school psychologists, administrators, and guidance counselors.     Dr. Galen Alessi, Professor of Psychology at Western Michigan University, conducted a fascinating study on school psychologists. Dr. Alessiâ€™s study illustrates why so many parents have problems dealing with schools. Dr. Alessiâ€™s article is \"Diagnosis Diagnosed: A Systemic Reaction\" published in Professional School Psychology, 3(2), 145-151.     The primary role of the school psychologist is to evaluate children to determine the reasons for learning and behavior problems. According to Dr. Alessi, when a child has trouble learning or behaving in school, the source of the child\'s problem can usually be traced to one or more of five causes.       First, the child may be misplaced in the curriculum, or the curriculum may include faulty teaching routines.       Second, the teacher may not be implementing effective teaching and/or behavioral management practices.     Third, the principal and/or other school administrators may not be implementing effective school management practices.     Fourth, the parents may not be providing the home-based support necessary for effective learning.     Fifth, the child may have physical and/or psychological problems that contribute to learning problems.     School psychologists from different areas of the country were interviewed and asked to complete an informal survey. The school psychologists were asked if they agreed that the five factors listed above play a \"primary role in a given school learning or behavior problem.\" (Page 148) The school psychologists agreed that these factors, alone or together, played a significant role in childrenâ€™s learning problems.     The school psychologists were surveyed about the number of children they evaluated during the past year for learning problems. The average number was about 120 cases (or kids). These numbers were rounded to 100 cases for each of the 50 psychologists for a total of 5,000 cases.     Alessi asked these psychologists how many reports they wrote in which they concluded that the childâ€™s learning problem was mainly due to curriculum factors. \"The answer was usually none. All cases out of the 5,000 examined confirmed that their schools somehow had been fortunate enough to have adopted only the most effective basal curricula.\" (Page 148)     Next, he asked how many reports concluded that the referring problem was due primarily to inappropriate teaching practices. \"The answer also was none. All cases out of the 5,000 examined proved that their districts had been fortunate enough to have hired only the most skilled, dedicated, and best prepared teachers in the land.\" (Page 149)     Then, he asked the psychologists how many of their reports found that the problem was due mainly to faulty school administrative factors. \"The answer again was none. All cases out of 5,000 examined demonstrated that their districts had hired and retained only the nationâ€™s very best and brightest school administrators.\" (Page 149)     When asked how many reports concluded that parent and home factors were primarily responsible, the answer ranged from 500 to 1,000 (10% to 20%). These positive findings indicated that we were finally getting close to the source of educational problems in schools. Some children just don\'t have parents who are smart, competent, or properly motivated to help their children do well in school.   Finally, I asked how many reports concluded that child factors were primarily responsible for the referred problem. The answer was 100%. These 5,000 positive findings uncovered the true weak link in the educational process in these districts: the children themselves.     If only these districts had better functioning children with a few more supportive parents, there would be no educational difficulties. (Page 149)     Alessi noted that in IEP disputes, \"family factors are invoked most often when the parent does not attend the meeting, or if the parent is involved in a way deemed â€˜inappropriateâ€™ by the school staff. Otherwise, child factors alone seem to carry the explanatory burden for school learning and behavior problems.\" (Page 149)     Based on the results of these 5,000 reports prepared by school psychologists, \"the results indicate clearly no need to improve curricula, teaching practices, nor school administrative practices and management. The only needs somehow involve improving the stock of children enrolled in the system, and some of their parents.\" (Page 149)     Alessi expressed serious concerns about his findings. If school psychologists define childrenâ€™s learning problems as existing solely within the child, \"it is equally unclear how school psychologists can help resolve this kind of problem. School psychologists seem to define school problems in ways that cannot be resolved.\"     When Dr. Alessi shared these findings with the school psychologists, many protested that \"all five factors are indeed responsible for school problems in the cases they studied, but that informal school policy (or â€˜school cultureâ€™) dictates that conclusions be limited to child and family factors.     Many feel that they could lose their jobs were they to invoke school-related factors. Certainly, they claim, their professional lives would be made very uncomfortable . . . The fact remains that no school psychologist in the group had determined that any existing problems were due to school-related factors.\" (Page 149)     The \"Child-as-the-Problem\"  Dr. Alessi discussed several additional reasons for the prevailing \"child-as-the-problem\" perspective of school psychologists. Graduate school programs focus on child problems and ignore or exclude school-related factors. Workshops and papers presented at school psychology conferences share the \"child-as-the-problem\" focus. Most school psychology journals focus exclusively on child factors.     School psychology textbooks have a clear \"child-as-the-problem\" bias. After examining several \"mainstream\" school psychology texts, Alessi found that when assessing childrenâ€™s reading problems, school factors were mentioned as a factor between 7% and 0% (zero) of the time. \"Child factors\" were held responsible for reading problems between 90% to 100% of the time.     Citing a classic book on reading disability, Alessi noted that it included no chapters about the connection between reading problems and school factors. The entire book focused on \"child factors.\" (Page 150)     The \"child-as-the-problem\" bias also pervades school psychology research and practice. Alessi referenced one work that presented an extensive review of the research on learning disabilities. \"Of the approximately 1,000 studies reviewed, not one examined the relation between school factors and learning disabilities.\" (Page 150)     In conclusion, Alessi observed that \"Parents trust school psychologists not to adopt assessment practices that are inherently biased in ways that could hinder, rather than help, their children.\" (Page 148)    \"Ethical Burdens\" on Psychologists  Dr. Alessi discussed the \"ethical burdens\" on school psychologists:     As this body of research grows, school psychologists will increasingly face the burden of deciding whether they work for the schools or for the children, in cases where the interests clash. (Page 150) \'We end with a discussion of the ethical burdens on school psychologists to be forthright and honest when reporting their findings.\'     He posed some questions: (Page 150)     Are we really helping children by concluding that children alone are responsible for their educational problems?     Are we helping the school system at the expense of the children?     How do we balance the rights of those who pay for our services against those who receive our services, when interests clash?     Is the role of the school psychologist to label children to help schools avoid improving faulty educational practices, or to help schools improve faulty educational practices to avoid labeling children?    Implications     As the parents of a child with special educational needs, what does this study tell you?     If you believe the staff at your childâ€™s school are not willing to look at what they need to do differently to help your child learn, you may be right.     If you believe that you and/or your child are being blamed for your childâ€™s learning problems, you may be right.      And if you believe that school factors (i.e., an inappropriate curriculum, faulty teaching, ineffective school administration and management practices) are contributing to your childâ€™s problems, you may be right.      Now what?     What are the implications of this study for you, the parent of a special needs child? Your job is to work with the school system to secure educational services for your child.     To make good decisions about your child\'s educational program, you need accurate information about your child\'s educational difficulties and educational needs. You will find this information in psychological and educational evaluations of your child. If you cannot rely on evaluations by school district personnel for this information, what can you do? Should you ask the school for an \"independent educational evaluation?\"     You have learned that many people who work in schools share the belief that the problems they have teaching children have little or nothing to do with the curriculum, their own training and experience, or school administrative factors. Instead, they believe that the childâ€™s problems are caused by the child himself.      Many people who work in schools -- school psychologists, guidance counselors, principals, and special education directors -- share this belief. Because school staff associate with other school staff, they continually reinforce the view of the \"child-as-the-problem\" in their dealings with one another.     As a parent, can you force educators and school psychologists to change their beliefs? No. This view of the \"child-as-the-problem\" exists and persists because it serves a purpose.     What would you think if the next time you attended an IEP meeting, the school staff told you that your childâ€™s worsening problems were caused by an inappropriate curriculum? Inadequately trained teachers? An incompetent principal? This won\'t happen.     As the parent of a special ed child, your job is to negotiate with school staff and secure a good quality special education program for your child. In your role as a negotiator, what do you need to know?     As a negotiator, your single most important tool is to understand and be able to explain the position of the \"other side\" as well or better than your own!     Once you understand the beliefs and perceptions of the school staff, you will be in a stronger position. You are more likely to accomplish your objective. When you understand how school people think and what they believe, you\'ll be able to generate \"win-win solutions\" that meet your child\'s needs -- and theirs.    Solutions  To accomplish your objective of getting a good educational program for your child, you must have accurate information about your child. This information includes the results of different psychological and educational tests. If you don\'t have good quality private sector diagnostic evaluations, you wont\' be able to develop an appropriate educational program for your child. Knowing that school psychologists are often biased, what options do you have?     What About Independent Educational Evaluations?     Parents ask: \"Why canâ€™t I tell the school that I want an independent educational evaluation done on my child? Money is short. Private testing is expensive. Arenâ€™t we are entitled to this?\"     Before we answer your question, letâ€™s change the facts.     If you belong to a managed carehealth plan, you have a primary care doctor. This person entered into a contractual agreement with your insurance company, and agreed to abide by certain rules. The most important rule is that this doctor agreed to hold medical costs down by managing care.How does this work?     In managed care,your primary care doctor acts as a \"gatekeeper,\" regulating (limiting) your access to medical treatment. If you go to a specialist without an appropriatereferral by your primary care doctor, your insurance company does not have to pay for your treatment. If your doctor is successful in holding costs down, the insurance company will reward him or her with financial bonuses. If your doctor isn\'t willing to play by these rules, the insurance company will probably cancel his contract. He will lose you and many other patients â€“ and his livelihood.     Now, letâ€™s assume that you have a sick child. You take your child to your primary care doctor who is associated with the managed care company. Although the doctor makes a diagnosis and prescribes treatment, your child gets sicker. You ask for a referral to a specialist. After discussion and disagreement, the doctor refers your child to a specialist â€“ who is also a member of the managed care plan.     This specialist signed a contract with the managed care entity in which he is forbidden to fully inform you about the treatment options for your child - this is called a \"gag order.\" If you learn about these treatments, you will want them for your child. The best solution from the insurance companies perspective is to keep you ignorant about these treatment options. because your HMO or managed care group does not want to pay for them.     Do you want your sick child treated by doctors who are not permitted to inform you about certain (expensive) treatment options? Of course not! Your childâ€™s health is at stake.     Now, letâ€™s return to your question about independent evaluations. Earlier in this article, you learned that most school psychologists officially consider only child or family factors when they assess childrenâ€™s learning and behavior problems. Arenâ€™t things different with independent evaluators?     The relationship between independent evaluatorsand school districts is often similar to the relationship between managed care specialists and insurance companies. In many jurisdictions, people who are on the approved listof independent evaluators have agreed to abide by certain rules. When they perform evaluations on children, they are paid by the school district.     As a parent, you have to ask yourself this question: If my evaluator is paid by the school district, how independent can he or she be?     In our practice, we see cases in which an independent educational evaluator recommends that a child receive more or different special education serves than the district wants to provide. After making pro-childrecommendations, these diagnosticians were dropped from the school districtâ€™s approved listof evaluators.     Private Sector Evaluations     Get a comprehensive psycho-educational evaluation of your child from an expert who is truly independent. The evaluations used to make educational decisions must contain accurate information about what your child really needs â€“ including changes that need to be made in curriculum, teaching methods, and/or school structure. The only people who will provide this information are experts in the private sector.     Low-Cost Evaluations    Many parents of kids with disabilities are financially strapped. Where can you get a quality psycho-educational evaluation of your child - without breaking the bank?     Contact local colleges and universities - if the school has a psychology program, you may be able to get an low cost or free evaluation of your child by a graduate student who is supervised by a professor.     Call child guidance clinics and community mental health centers. Ask about sliding fee scales.    Visit your state Yellow Pages for Kids with Disabilities for evaluators, academic tutors, advocates, and others who help parents get services for children.     Ask other parents - they are often your best resource. More advice about finding and working with evaluators and consultants.      A Personal Message from Pete &amp; Pam Wright    If you are the parent of a child with special educational needs, you must learn about school culture - how schools work and beliefs held by many school personnel. When you understand school culture, many of the obstacles you face when you advocate for your child will be clear.     Children can do without many things they want and not be damaged. But your child needs an appropriate education. The most meaningful gift you can make to your child is the gift of a good education. This gift will pay dividends for the rest of your childâ€™s life.     Focus on what you need to learn and do to obtain an appropriate education for your child. Good luck!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to 15 year old with Early Infantile Autism, Inattentive ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Anxiety Disorder</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to 15 year old with Early Infantile Autism, Inattentive ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Anxiety Disorder</div>'

We put him on the potty every 15 minutes.  After a couple days the struggles got less and less.  We had to start out rewarding for just sitting on the potty at first.  Then reward for at least peeing in the bathroom.  When he relaxed he would dribble a little pee and we would reward again.  The therapist also suggested cutting a hole in is pull up to give him the comfort of the pull up but the pee would get into the correct place.  Then loads of prasise.  I was able to potty him over my spring break. Hang in there.  Best of luck.</div>'

Poor Luke, he has had such a rough time of it this past week...I knew it was just a matter of time until the behaviours had a ripple effect into other areas so I was not surprised when the school called.  I have to say that Luke was so well behaved all afternoon, he had abit of a rough evening when daddy came home though.  I did a social story with Luke about good and naughty behaviour at school and what are his rewards when he is good and what are his consequences when he is naughty, he really listened to the story, it\'s a computer program that I can type and the words and a matching pic pop up, then I can press a button on my computer and the computer will read it out loud...it\'s really neat, Luke is very receptive to it because it communicates on the 3 levels of communication, written, visual and auditory whereas if I just talk to him he only gets one level. We went over the story 4 times.  Poor little guy, I understand why he is acting out, but at the same time he still needs to be disciplined for the bad behaviour, hoping tomorrow will be alittle better at school.  he has speech therapy tomorrow afternoon, I can\'t wait to get back to our old therapy now, we were so lucky she still had the spot open, I had fortunately just told her I wanted to take a break while we did some other stuff for a couple of months (I learnt a long time ago never to give up old therapists until I have all my ducks lined up), so when I called her yesterday she was able to give us back our spot....phewwww.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Since our kids do much better with concrete concepts I sat down with him and demonstrated soft (gentle) touch and hard (hurting) touch and used those words for it.  I would touch something like a stuffed animal softly stroking, petting and say this is being soft.  Then it would hit it, throw it etc and say this is being hard and/or hurting and/or breaking depending on the specific reason for this exercise hurting if I want to teach him not to hit people, breaking if I want him to stop breaking things etc. if So that when I tell him to be soft with something he understands what being soft means.  And if he is having a hard time remembering the idea do this everytime before giving him the computer.  He may stop breaking it just to stop your reminders.  But by making sure they understand the language by labelling it along with an action makes it a more concrete idea and less vague.      Also I just realized that I don\'t use the word don\'t with my son I always use either no or stop.  I think it is again recognizing that no and stop are more concrete ideas than don\'t or do not.  And I know he understands both no and stop.  I think the real secret is to pick one word and consistently use that one word to convey to him to be soft or gentle or whatever word you want to use.  When language is hard and communication is difficult you want to make it as easy as possible and using more than one word with the same meaning is going to be more confusing.  So right at first at least always use the same language.      This was something I learned at my son\'s school, we were fortunate to be able to send my son to a private autism school for a couple of years of preschool because the school district had contracted with the private school to run their autism preschool classes for them.  It was a fabulous program and this was one of the things I learned while volunteering, language is important and the kids had been taught certain words mean certain things and to use those words consistently and even if my personal reasoning that I stated earlier in this post is wrong the process works.  Whatever laguage you decide to use, be soft, be gentle, softly, gently always use that specific language he will learn what it means.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I am considering going to intake and seeing what supports they can put in place to make it safer. Even so, I don\'t think it\'s reasonable to think he would never get to the stairwell unattended. The district has been unwilling and/or unable (I don\'t know which) to find another placement.

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">For example how would you tackle referencing with RDI versus ABA?</div>  Respect-   I haven\'t tought referencing through ABA. We do do some RDI type exercies for this. For example we roll a ball back and forth. This is a pattern that took a while to get established as my son typically would try and take over an activity. Once the rhythm is set, I introduce variations- roll/bounce, fast/slow, roll other objects etc. Next I will roll the ball only when he gives me the signal that he is ready and similarly he needs to watch for my signal for when to roll.   Variations are endless. For example this morning we were in a room with 4 beanbags (nothing else) and we would crash into the beanbags, but he had to reference me first and I would use my facial expressions to point out which beanbag comes next.   Or we walk together and I stop at random. He looks up and I nod when it\'s time to keep going.   Grocery stores are great for referencing. I tell him what we need and he gets it and then looks at me to see if it\'s the right brand. Or he references on which aisle to go next.  I use a lot of pauses, sudden interruptions in talking, gasps etc to get him to look at me. Ironically, the less I talk, the more he would check out my face. My son has always had great eye contact (except for the very beginning when we ran a quick \"look at me \" ABA program). But in reality he wasn\'t referencing. It is only now that he starts to look at me for meaning, for resolving uncertainty, to share excitement etc.   Funny enough, now it is he who would get aggravated when we don\'t look at him and would tell us \"look at me\" or \"watch me mommy\".   Hope it helps a little.   Alex\'s mom</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">ok I know this thread is getting a little old but I had to share this.  My DS hit his head today and needed stitches.  I was afraid they were going to want to give him a tetnus shot so I asked about it and called DH at home to look up the thimerosal content on the Institute for Vaccine Safety and check it for me.  I didn\'t even think about the tetnus possibility until I was in the car on the way to the ER.  And my son is fine just needed staples not stitches.  So when the nurse asked if I wanted him sedated with a nasal spray they use I told her no some of them have mercury in them.  Which I learned on this board.  So by the time the Dr. came in and told me he wouldn\'t need the shot (DS got his vaccinations up to 2yrs) and then tried to tell me that I didn\'t need to be concerned about the mercury there was a massive study just done... (I cut him off and said)\"Tthe Verstraten study yes.  Dr. Verstraten said he isn\'t getting his grand kids vaccinated and said that since they can make the study say what ever they want he didn\'t even know why they bothered to do it.\"  I then told him that I had no faith in epidemiological studies and only looked at clinical trials.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Just a Mom!  Nice to see you!      Boy, do I hear you about other people\'s problems.  Most the time I hear them complaining and I\'m like, \"oh you GOTTA be kidding me...\"    My daughter is on a dance team.  The reason she is on it is to help remediate her gross motor deficits and teach her to use her body correctly through learning and perfecting a single dance, which she will then perform with the team in competition, which will then hopefully give her the \"island of competence\" that aspie kids need to draw from.  She is in TAP dancing because I think the proprioceptive input of striking her feet to the ground will help her calm herself and give pressure on her joints.    The reason the OTHER kids are on this team is for the mothers to try and get their little girls to be \"stars\" as early as possible.  They try to arrange it so their children are in the front and center and put lip gloss on them before class.  This amazes me.  I couldn\'t care less if my daughter was in the back row on the far left as long as her deficits are being remediated.  The irony of all this is that my daughter ended up front and center.     Funny the difference in how we see things now.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">A couple of things that come to mind are first I thought also that my son wasn\'t understanding what I was saying to him because I wasn\'t getting any feedback.  He was just turning two and we were starting to suspect something was wrong.  I\'d mentioned my concern to my friend, then soon after had her babysit.  She\'d taken something away from him and told him not to touch.  A few minutes later she looked over and he was giving her a defiant look and touched it with one finger.  He could hear and he understood.  I was shocked when she told me and he didn\'t get away with \"mommy doesn\'t know I understand\'  any more.  I told him to do something and then started backing it up cause now I knew he understood.  But he couldn\'t express himself so I\'d had no idea.    Also one thing I discovered is that if I use the exact same phrase everytime I want him to do something it is less confusing for him.  I have a specific phrase for calling him to dinner, telling him to get dressed etc. His compliance increased after I started doing this.    A question about backward chaining, were you asking how to do it or you do know how but were looking for ways to make it a game?      I taught my son his letters using a wooden alphabet puzzle.  I started by helping him put it together and labeling while doing it.  Then I would hide all but three pieces like \"A\" \"X\" and \"T\"  then tell him \"get the \"T\"\' (again always using the exact same phrase) some letters he knew better than others and I\'d have to help him if he didn\'t.  I\'d point to it and say \"this is the \"T\", get the \"T\"\" and if he did do it I\'d point to where it went and if he still didn\'t I\'d put my hand over his and help him pick it up and put it in.      Also the Handwriting without tears program is great for getting a jump start and not having it feel like work.  They base it on the fact that every letter can be made by a combination of four shapes 1-big line 2- little line 3-big curve 4-little curve.  So you get the shapes and help them make them into letters.  Later they can use slates and chalk which is also a lot of fun.    One thing I also did was label how he was feeling, if he was shivering when he\'d just come out of the bath I\'d say \"D- is cold.\"  Stuff like that.  If he was mad about something I\'d say \"D- is mad.\"  If he wanted a drink besides working on getting him to ask for it I would also say \"D-is thirsty.\"    I think they will understand if it is the same from day to day you can still use regular speech as a model for them and talk to them but if you want them to do something use the same phrase each time so they can understand what is expected of them.    Yes he can learn and if he doesn\'t imitate you help him imitate you.  you do it and then go to him and physically move his hands in the same thing.   This also how you start teaching sign.  Hand over hand modeling is very commonly used in ABA and teaching sign language.  I also think it helps them to bring them out of their world and into this one.    I know some people want to accept and don\'t want to take thier kids out of their world.  The problem is that they have to survive in this one.  But for me and mine I want for my son what I want for all of my kids for them to reach their highest potential what ever it may be.  My son is constantly surprising me with the things he\'s learned that I had no idea he knew, and I\'ve heard this same sentiment over and over from other parents and from stories about autistic kids.  If a child can\'t learn to read because he/she is dislexic then you use the specific teaching methods that have been developed to help children with dislexia learn to read.  I view my son\'s delays in the same light.  He has the potential to be very close to normal if he gets the intervention and is taught using methods that have been developed to teach kids with his specific problem.  I want what we all want for our kids I want him to be happy.  To know the love of a good woman, the joy of being a father, the pride of providing for his family, the satifaction of being good at his job.      Sorry for the soapbox, something I\'ve been thinking about for a while just came out in this particular post.    Anyway I just want you to know that they really do absorb more than we think they do.  Keep talking.    I hope this helps some and that you get some more suggestions there are a lot out there.</div>'

Just last night I told my son to \"Hold your horses!\" and he looked at me like  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" />   and said \"horses?  that\'s funny!\"  Captain Literal strikes again!  He has \"gotten\" some expressions though so it can be done.  Usually what I do is stop and explain what the expression really means.  Like I told him that \"hold your horses\" means wait a minute, and then we say it a few times so he can grasp the concept.  He wanted more jelly on a biscuit, by the way, and I said \"hold your horses\" and made him wait a few seconds each time I needed to put more on.  He is 6, so he\'s just a little older than your son.  It\'s kind of fun to stop and notice when you use these expressions and explain them as you go along.  This sounds kind of lame, but I hope it helps!   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />   Stacy</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Actually it\'s not as hard as you think.  There is a community of Amish people the majority of whom haven\'t vaccinated and someone was doing a study looking to see if he could find any autistic amish kids.

I didn\'t read the rest of the study yet but the first part I\'d read based on the statistics of 1 on 166 there should have been over 300 autistic Amish.  The part I\'d read he only been able to locate three.  One had had an accidental high exposure to methylmercury the other two had been vaccinated.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thank you for the information. My son has been in Early Childhood Education for about a year and a half now. His IEP is under developmental delay, because his behavioral and social problems were thought to be ADHD-related.  This spring, after watching the very first episode of \'Parenthood\' on NBC, it just clicked! I read up on the different ASD\'s and called his pediatrician for referrals, and that started the ball rolling. The IEP team has to reconvene soon to list my son under Autism, and add some related services (I think we may only add direct OT, possibly speech, and an aide). He will be in 4K for 2.5 hours 4 days a week with 15-20 other kids instead of the quiet Early Childhood class with 2 other kids the same amount of time. Might not go so well with so many other kids, so we may have to consider another venue as his LRE (Least Restrictive Environment).  When it all comes to an end, yes, he can be in school and get services, but 4K or EC for kids his age only run for 2.5 hours 4 days a week. He needs at least 20 hours/week of one-on-one therapy. He is regressing and becoming more and more violent with children. If home were to be considered his LRE, would the school accomodate the therapy he needs?  I know this is all way off topic of fundraising, but thank you for your concern!</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">MCA, I really like a lot of the things you wrote instead of just having one goal to stop tantrumming. I definitely think you have the right idea. Meltdowns don\'t happen for no reason (stickboy26- I really like your description and share a lot in common with what you wrote).     Maybe more realistic goals would be things like trying to teach your son to ask for a break if he\'s feeling overwhelmed. Sometimes it can be very hard or impossible to express things through speech if a person is getting near a meltdown, so maybe even come up with some nonverbal signal he can use if he\'s too stressed to talk and needs some time to calm down. Then have some safe and relaxing place he can go to and just unwind on his own until he\'s feeling better.    Since it sounds like he gets really frustrated when things aren\'t clear to him or he doesn\'t understand what he\'s supposed to be doing, maybe work with him on asking for clarification if he\'s confused.    Personally if I was having a meltdown I would probably freak out a whole lot more if somebody was telling me to relax and touching my arm. If I have a meltdown I need to be left completely alone and not talked to or expected to talk for about half an hour to recover. I think it\'s important to look at what causes the meltdowns and try to give your son skills to avoid them, because once a meltdown is happening I don\'t think it\'s something that can be given replacement behaviors or snapped out of or whatever, because people don\'t have control of themselves when they are having meltdowns (unlike things like tantrums over the TV, which could probably be worked on).</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">The one medication my son takes that is not BioMedical is a sleeping pill.  Why for his safety.  He will do all the above mentioned and hummm let me see.  Walk out of the house!  Empty the fridge of all contents with one bite taken out of everything frozen or even raw meat.  Flood my tiolet.  I could go on and on but I will stop there.  There are very cheat alarms they you can by at any walmart.  Once the door is opened the alarm will go off.  We have this on many doors in the house.  That is a possibility.  I am lucky mine is a big mama\'s boy and the first thing he does every morning is crawl into be with me so I know he is awake.  I know many ppl do not like the idea of sleeping pills but for my son\'s safety I have to use them.  Good Luck!</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">My child is in an autism program in which I observe every single day that indeed, autistic kids DO want to be social - they just do not know how to adeptly go about it - yet</div>  LBP- that\'s an interesting observation, my son was in an autism program last year (age 5) and my observation  was the exact opposite  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" />  Actually when ds was 4-ish, he had a \"thing\" about hugging other kids. I thought at the time - great, he wants to be friendly, all we have to do is teach appropriate ways to interact. Now he will definitely be able to understand and remember a \"no hugging\" rule for example, and probably has enough language and skills to sort of \"hang in there\" in a peer interaction (maybe a little slower, and certainly immature, but do-able), but the interest isn\'t there. I can\'t quite figure it out, if it\'s an issue of feeling insecure, or incompetent in more challenging social situations (which would be my favorite explanation, since time will probably help this one), versus a genuine disinterest (which I fear is the more likely factor).   <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">to try and TEACH the autistic child but not to try and CHANGE the autistic child </div>    After the Einstein comparison, this is the statement that comes up a lot and has always puzzled me. I wish someone could explain to me how you can teach a child with autism without \"fighting\" some part of their autism.   I don\'t think my son has any additional learning problems on top of his autism. It is 100% his autism which is holding him back from learning things. If I didn\'t address his autistic features (to begin with, his total lack of interest in me- his primary \"teacher\") he would have never learned anything.   I\'m aware he will always be autistic, but I don\'t think he can learn certain important skills without having some of his autistic traits chipped away at.  An example that comes to mind- it\'s an autistic thing to look at a picture featuring prominently displayed across the page 2 kids playing ball, and not to see them, but to concentrate instead on the tiny number in the upper corner of the page. This may not be important now, but when he grows up, it may be the bus coming right at him that he will tune out. It will take lots of practice to change that, I may never change it , but how can I NOT want to change that? Will my son be changed if he masters being able to pick out the essential in a situation and no longer focuses on his little pet-peeves only? You bet. Is that a bad thing? Probably not if you want to have a better shot at a real-life existence. Will my son do it? No idea  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" />  , but doesn\'t mean I\'m not going to try and help with this.  I think based on my understanding of Asperger syndrome, that some of the more severe issues our kids face, aren\'t there. Some of our children more severely impacted by autism will very likely go through life with someone by their side to constantly \"interpret\" the outside world to them. Not just physically helping, like pushing a wheelchair, but literally serving as a bridge to the surrounding environment, controlling sensory input, repeating things, slowing down pace, all the way to the more basic needs (case by case).  I think most parents would want to help minimize that as much as  possible, and since autism is the big issue here, it makes perfect sense to me to try and combat the autism. If this means \"changing\" the child, I don\'t really see a problem with that.   Also, because autism is such a huge spectrum of flavorings, I will see one person\'s experience and thoughts as one person\'s experience and thoughts, regardless of whether that person is ASD or NT.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I am so sorry you are both going through this, it is frustrating not knowing exactly what is wrong with your child.  And although you have a pretty good idea once you get the official diagnosis it is a relief and a blow at the same time.      Your daughter sounds a lot like my son in certain areas.  And I think you will hear this frequently -she sounds like mine except...-  one of the difficult things about autism is that no two kids are ever exactly alike.  But that being said in broad general catagories from what you said it sounds like she struggles in the three main areas of Autism communication, socialization, and sensory.      Many of our kids are kind and loving but they get frustrated and angry and lost just like we do but they can\'t express it.  So no I don\'t think you are making a mountain out of a molehill, and kudos to you for noticing and persueing help for her.    Once you have the diagnosis then is the time to start therapies with her.  When you get the diagnosis tell them you want to talk to a social worker or  someone that can help you find the local resources to help both her and you learn about the therapies cause once you understand how to help her it may still be a war zone with her for a while after that but they should start to improve as she gets used to them.    One other thing I want you to keep in mind.  Take any kind of IQ score or cognitive delay diagnosis with a grain of salt.  The communication issues and lack of imitation so common with autistic kids makes getting an accurate IQ or cognative assesment very difficult.  So often I hear about older kids who are finally able to communicate (computers, learn to talk, start writing) and they shock their parents that they can read or write, having taught themselves.      My son did this to me twice first he was still two and didn\'t respond to commands so I stopped telling him and asking him things.  I\'d talked to my friend about my concerns and that we were having a hearing test the next week, but I didn\'t think it was a hearing problem.  She babysat for me and when I came to pick him up she told me that she\'d taken away an object she didn\'t want him to play with and put it back on the end table telling him not to touch it.  When she looked back a couple of minutes later he gave her a mischevious look and touched it with one finger.  I was so surprised.   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" />     So after that and to this day I always talk to him like he understands what I am telling him but realize that he can\'t respond much of the time.  With no feedback it is hard to know how much they are getting.  The second time with my son he\'d gotten into the crayons and paper his older sister had gotten out and wrote the alphabet in order in three neat rows.  Some of the letters you only could tell what they were by where they were but for the most part he got them the right general shape.  Again he shocked me.  We\'d sporatically worked on some of the letters, I had no idea he\'d picked up that much.    YES we are out here and although we are in the same boat we\'ve been given some oars.  You will too, but like many of us you may have to fight for them.  This isn\'t an easy diagnosis to deal with and there are no overnight cures you are pretty far out to sea and it will be a long haul.  BUT there are lots of people to help you find the right oars for your boat and some therapies out there that can bring you pretty close to shore even if they can\'t bring you all the way into port.  And along the way you will see some things that will amaze you, and touch you, and help you realize the miracles when you see them.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Merry,    I hope the catalogue of things you can buy doesn\'t put you off. I haven\'t seen the TV film (if you <em>google</em> it you can read a review), but I\'ve got the rest of the books and tapes, and they are worth a look. You can buy \'Son -Rise the Miracle Continues\' online from amazon, but I don\'t think any of the other stuff is as mainstream. It all relates to the program itself and you can\'t get it anywhere else. They recommend you read and listen to these things so you\'ll have some understanding of how it works before you jump in with both feet. Any Son-Rise parent in your area would probably be happy to share or lend copies if you asked. I know I would, but my videos won\'t play on a US system.   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" />     You can join our message board to get in touch with other parents and ask us questions to your heart\'s content. There are lots of people there who are only just thinking about it or who are working in schools and want to use the strategies to reach their kids. javascript&#058;emoticon(\':D\')  Very Happy    As to the phone call, you ring them up and they will actually schedule \'the call\' and phone you back at the time you choose. Then they\'ll spend 25 minutes with you answering specific questions about your child\'s stimming (they call it<em> isming</em>) and how you can begin to understand it, and about communication with your child plus anything you have on your mind (so make a list!)    Give me a shout anytime if I can help, or just to let me know how you get on.    Wishing you success and happiness in your quest,  Lynn</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Over all I think it sounded really good.  There are however a few things I would change.  When you say \"I would like\" it gives the impression that it is negotiable and you probably won\'t get it.  I\'d reword the bit about the psychoed testing.    <span style=\"color: red\">In order to develop an appropriate IEP, his academic strengths, level of performance, learning style and specific needs should be determined.  All of this can be accomplished with psychoed testing</span> (and if anyone has suggested it to you add) <span style=\"color: red\">as suggested by--------.</span>    This gives the impression it is definately needed to do the IEP.  Also when addressing the issue of restraints I would change    <span style=\"color: red\">\"I would like to request clarification...\" </span> to <span style=\"color: red\"> \"There needs to be clarification...\" </span>  and    <span style=\"color: red\">\"Due to D\'s background, restraint....</span>\"  to   <span style=\"color: red\">\"Due to the physical abuse in D\'s background...\"</span>    I would change the last one mostly because you\'ve gone over several other issues between describing his background and going over the restraint issue so reminding the administrator exactly what in his background would cause his escalation, gives it a more serious air.    Also I would take out <span style=\"color: red\"> \"To my mind\"</span> altogether and start with <span style=\"color: red\">\"That\"  </span>    And change  <span style=\"color: red\">\"I only want to see D restrained...\"</span>  to  \"<span style=\"color: red\">D should only be restrained...\"</span>    And change<span style=\"color: red\"> \"I\'d like his IEP to discuss...\"  </span>to <span style=\"color: red\">\"his IEP needs to include the use of touch...\"</span>    But that pretty much covers what I would change.  You are requesting these things you said so more than once so I don\'t think you should keep saying \"I\" because then they think you are the only one thinking these things when there may be others at the school that also think the way you do, and your husband, and your attorney if the school won\'t cooperate.    As far as I can tell it is a good letter.  But you may want to wait and see what Mom from Mass has to say, if I\'m remembering right she works in the system as an advocate or something and is more familiar with this type of thing.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Last minute question- it just occured to me that with the army of sped folks involved in ds\'s FAPE I completely forgot the teachers in the mainstream classes he attends- music, PE, computer, art. For those of you with older children (ASD and/or NT) is it customary to do something for these as well ?

' <div class=\"postbody\">I haven\'t had to deal with this recently, but boy was it frustrating when I did!  I told more than one person (pediatrician and family members included) that although I appreciated their concern and optimism, I was also highly insulted that they would question how well I knew/was in-tune with my own child.  I also constantly felt the need to explain that I was not looking for something to be wrong; instead, I was looking for answers in order to better understand and get him the help I knew he needed.      At the same time, autism is hard to explain, even for those of us who know it intimately, so for outsiders it can be nearly impossible to understand completely.  Perhaps you could also ask them how much they know about autism and take the opportunity to explain that it is a very broad spectrum and that autism does not = rainmain.  Sometimes it helps those who don\'t get it, especially if dealing with a higher-functioning child, to reference Temple Grandin or other high profile autistics.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">My son had that problem. He\'s adult teeth were coming up behind his baby teeth. Both on his bottom and top two. One of his bottom baby teeth came out on it\'s own, but the others wouldn\'t budge. We ended up having to have him put under to have the others pulled. I waited in hopes that they would all come out on their own, but it got to a point where his mouth was looking like a sharks mouth - yikes! It just became obvious that they were going to have to be pulled. I\'m so glad your sons tooth came out on it own. Hopefully the other one will come out on it own too. I know the thought of having them put under is nerve wracking.

' <div class=\"postbody\">My son\'s stims (ticking like a clock and flapping his hands when excited) increased the first couple of weeks on the diet.  And the whinning too!  Oh, and he smacked someone at school in first few weeks.  I\'m sorry you\'re having a horrible couple of days.  I really impressed you\'ve decided to give the diet and biomed a try.      We have GFCF bakery/cafe near us and one of the customers started her 17 year old daughter on the diet in May.  We see her every few weeks and she\'s made some great progress.  The daughter is much more relaxed, able to sit through the meal, and smiles at people she knows and makes fleeting eye contact.  Her mom said she has at least tripled her sign language in recent weeks.  Gives me hope for all of our kids.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">have you ever looked into hippotherapy?  my son has taken this twice..one really good program and one so-so program but they gain a sense of balance (unknowingly because they have to balance on the horse) while doing other activities some using gross motor others using more fine motor skills.  my son really enjoyed it after about the second lesson (it took a little persistance getting him used to the horse).      we also bought a therapy swing that has three attachments: a regular swing, a net swing and a bar/rings to hang on.  it attaches using tension to a regular door frame (i think that they had extenders for doors that were extra wide) and it wasn\'t terribly expensive (i think 189 for the whole kit.  my son hangs on those rings for two minutes at a time now.  we put it in the entrance to our master bedroom where he can see our tv and it has just become second nature to hang and watch his videos.  the company is called playaway indoor toy company and the set is the rainy day playground.  i would give you additional information but it has been worn off from use.  it was a great investment and has seen a ton of use.    we have done gymnastics, karate and swimming and i must say our biggest benefit has come from swimming.  the gymnastics and karate were just too much for him because it was a \"group\" event and he wanted to march to his own drummer.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Hope Mom of Three - TG - 13, ER - 10 and Sam - 8.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Hope Mom of Three - TG - 13, ER - 10 and Sam - 8.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">My son\'s eyesight was like the autism so incredibly obvious you just couldn\'t miss it.  He would put his nose litteraly just in front of the TV.  So he\'s worn glasses since very young and has destroyed many many of them.  Make sure the ones you get have a warranty or guarantee of some sort usually about a year.  It helps to get the ones that are flex frames they last longer and take more abuse.      The last two times they broke he cried.  He can\'t see with them and LIKES to be able to see.  We have back ups so that got settled pretty quickly but he kept saying I can\'t see I can\'t see.  Also on days when I sometimes can\'t find either his originals or his back ups he does much much worse at school.  So I\'d bet he\'ll like school a lot better.      I don\'t think my son has been teased about his glasses but I\'m not with him at school so I don\'t know.  He is in an enclosed class where they eat lunch and go to recess at different times than the typical kids so I doubt it.  Even if he did his socialization is such that I don\'t think it\'d make a difference to him.  He is also seven.  But that may not be the case with your son.  It is an adjustment and can be a real pain at time but it is very much worth it.  Just make sure that they are comfortable so he keeps them on.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Jill, we had the same phenomena happen twice with Zithromax.  There are some posts on here about it from back last spring.  It was unbelievable, miraculous.    Hope all is well with your baby and the scope.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">To piggy-back on what Winnie said re offering a reinforcing alternative: We made a routine where \"snack\" or \"juice\" time came right after outside time so that he would transition better and its really worked well for him.  We would just say \"okay time to go inside and get juice.\"  I also think it\'s a more natural way to transition (I also think it makes being with you/going with you more reinforcing).      Winnie has a great idea with the picture schedule as well.  We do a 1-2-3 board with a picture of whatever it is he wants to do at the end of the 1-2-3 strip so that he knows how much work/activity and when finished.  This has really helped as well.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Susan,  Could you afford the workshop and then about $120 on top of that? The workshop is good but you\'d still have to read the book through and through. With me helping you (and Tami and whoever want the help), I think you make it fine without the workshop. BUT I\'d still not bother getting that kit! It\'s around $300 and it\'s set up for a class. You\'ll get all sorts of duplicates you\'ll never use and you paid for it! I gave a lot away to the teachers. SORRY. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /> I should have thought it through but my son\'s teacher and aide were very into this and I appreciated their help so I am glad they have copies of what I could give them.     The teacher\'s manual is included in the workshop price (saves you $50). No matter if you went to the workshop or not, I wouldn\'t purchase any more than the following (as long as you have a printer and we can exchange emails):    <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://shop.ganderpublishing.com/IW_Products.m4p.pvx?;MULTI_ITEM_SUBMIT\">https://shop.ganderpublishing.com/IW_Pr ... TEM_SUBMIT</a><!-- m -->    $13.95  =  OCN Cubes  $33.95  =  Plastic number line  $49.95  =  OCN Family Fact Cards (no drawings, very clear for our kids)  $19.95  =  OCN Cloud Triangle Cards (get if you can afford it)  $24.95  =  OCN Numeral Imagery cards (get if you can or make yours)  (also get playdough, marbles or incentives and money is good, med/large dry erase board, ability to print/printer)    I have extra copies and stuff to send to you so don\'t get the other stuff that listed in Gander. We can exchange email and I can send you what I have.    You need the cubes and plastic number line. The cubes fit perfectly into the number line and you will use this over and over. The cardboard number lines are not very good. The cubes move off of them and they don\'t stick together as well as the plastic.    I\'ve been through this entire program and you CAN MAKE SOME OF THIS STUFF and utilize the program perfectly fine. It\'s up to you. I could have easily made the Numeral Imagery Cards. They are just the numbers 1 on up through 20 on a card. Get blank flashcards or index cards and draw the numbers!!! The OCN numeral cards do have squares on the backs but  you don\'t use them!     The fact family cards are EXCELLENT. They are clear (meaning no drawings or other things to divert attention to the numbers), the corners help you know which side has the answer. I found them to be the best out there so I\'d get them again if I had to. Whatever you do, if you want to purchase your own, don\'t get any with drawings or anything to distract the child from the numbers. Most all of these flashcards stick some dumb drawing on there. You don\'t want that.    The triangle cards I thought at first were useless and at first my son didn\'t understand them. As we got further into the program, they became more important. We didn\'t use them often but enough that he understood the families. The large number is always at the top. The sides are division, the across at the bottom is multiplication. Now with divisibility rules and other things we see the triangle or family. It\'s nice to see it all make sense and so that\'s why it would be good to get some sort of triangle cards but you don\'t have to pay for those if you can get it for a less expensive price.     If you can read the teacher\'s manual, ask me questions when you need some help and then practice before you start with your child, you can do this. It\'s not hard, it just takes time. After a while you\'ll get used to what the program is about: <strong>concrete to imagery to computation</strong>.    Susan, let me know what you think you\'ll do!        Tami,  We had the same thing happen when we first told them no other crazy math methods. Suddenly \'he got it\'. I got the phone call that day.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x\" title=\"Mad\" />  I was so mad. You gotta wonder what\'s going on. We live in 2 different States but they came up with the same thing. UGH UGH UGH      Winnie  Thanks! I do think by taking matters into our own hands we get more respect as parents and begin the process of proving to these teachers that you can teach our kids! If I listened to them, my son would be in a lower level math and scrambling with that! I have to say his 5th grade teacher was a Godsend! But she has autism in the family.       Well whoever is going to do this, just let me know when you get the materials and I\'m here to help. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />     b\'s mom</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ B, 10, AS  LMB Bell V/V &amp; OCN, pragmatic lang, fiber, vits, avoid gluten, Nord Nat omega 3-6-9.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ B, 10, AS  LMB Bell V/V  OCN, pragmatic lang, fiber, vits, avoid gluten, Nord Nat omega 3-6-9.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Rebekah,    I was just thinking about a few things that I might want to do if I were in your position.  There is a good possibility that you\'re already doing some of them already, so I apologize if I am pointing out the obvious...    *Create folders for each of your students containing the following information, and keep them in the classroom, within your reach, for reference and adding notes, etc.     *Create a simple form for parents to fill out about their child\'s likes, dislikes, specific sensory issues, etc. (general stuff) Perhaps even invite them to tell their history/story if they are comfortable doing so.  This might give you even more insight into the children and the families and enable you to better serve them individually. Some families might be guarded with this information, while others will be grateful for the opportunity to share.     *Request that parents share with you what other kinds of intervention they are receiving outside of the school (OT, meds, diet, etc.) or have received in the past, and ask for <em>specifics </em>about what worked and what did not work (Ex.: When Johnny starts to grab and squeeze people, it is helpful to squeeze his hands tightly and say \"squeeeeeeze\", giving him the sensory feedback he is requesting). [Again, I hope this doesn\'t sound overly elementary... but I have dealt with some teachers over the years form my NT daughter that were FAR from \"tuned in\" to their students, so I can\'t help but believe that the same applies to special ed teachers.]    *Take notes about important things that you might observe from children throughout the day and periodically update each child\'s file with your own notes and observations.     *Invite parents to e-mail you with any questions or concerns.     *Invite parents to participate or volunteer periodically when possible.     **While taking notes, make a point to send a note or email home (asap or within a week) whenever you see something POSITIVE -- even if it is as simple as telling them about a breif moment that brought joy to a particular child.        Best of luck to you.  I\'m sure you will be dealing with parents as diverse as their children, and some will be easier to work with than others.  On behalf of moms everywhere, thank you for caring and doing what you do.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I had a question to ask anyone if they knew, I\'m going to be moving to Orlando Florida sometime soon, as soon as i get the resources to. But my question is are there any services in the Orlando area that maybe my daughter could use (she has autism) are the schools very decent there? Are there any decent low rent apartments? Im a little concerned becuase i\'m going to need to find daycare, a job and a  place to live there.  its really becuase me and my daughter live here with my mother and my grandfather and there\'s a lot of the \'multi-parent\' syndrome..if you know what i mean. and i think its so important that i establish the fact that I AM mom, not my mom, not my grandpa, and it just seems its not going to happen here.  I want to move to Orlando becuase i have family and friends there and  a strong support system. her father basically doesnt want anything to do with me or her which is sad but its really HIS loss, anyway.. my boyfriend lives down there too and he and her really get along great and i think personally its SO important that she have a strong and positive male figure in her life, so she can get some sort of balance.   Anyway enough of my rants! heheh  Thanks everyone.    --Amy  Andreah 5yrs ASD</div>'

Sometimes if he fusses for a second, I will talk to him softly from the hallway outside of his room and tell him, \"Mommy loves you, it\'s OK. Time to go to sleep.\"    I know it\'s not easy though.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Oh can i identify with this! I feel so bad for you, because i feel the same way having experienced it too.     Ok, it might be hard for a five year old NT child to understand they are going on a play date with an autistic child, but i mean, who has to tell them the \"reasons\" behind the play date. The mom could come over and have a cup of coffee with you while you both supervise junior and jane.    Can i suggest that you find a sympathetic teacher or principal and ask that she asks the parents or maybe pin points a parent or two who she knows might be more willing to help out? This could be done very discreetly.     My own neighbour was so excited at the birth of her granddaughter and kept me informed right up to the moment of birth. She brought the little tot to my front door step for me to see because I love kids, but she wouldnt come in the house!! Also she promised that my son would be invited over for tea parties and what not with her other grandkids the same age. Never happened, not in two years!  I am almost sure she thinks autism is catchy and that is why she never came into the house!!    Now that my own boy is \"growing\" into his autism and his behaviors are more prevalent, the little girls and boys who doted on him when he was 2, dont show any interest any more. someone has been talking and word has got out that my boy is autistic. Its amazing the turn around from last year to this.     Very very sad. My boy squeals with delight when he sees the kids out in the street and cries his eyes out when they dont come to play with him. He hangs onto the front gate pleading for me to let him out into the street but of course, i cant.     I have even thought of paying the little tots to come over and play. We have great toys and every video you can imagine. I suppose we have to make our kids and our houses extra special fun to entice kids to come over. What i have noticed though on the rare occasion when the young boys came over is they play with my son\'s toys, then leave. They have no interest in playing with him.    I am getting depressed again just thinking about it and am so thankful that we are parents who are truly committed to helping our kids have friends by overcoming autism. It will happen, but this road is a long journey, one which for me has plenty of pot holes yet to come.     Hang in there and think about asking the teachers. There must be other kids on the spectrum in the area who could use peer role models as well. who knows ,you might link up with the parents of an autistic child who has siblings who are NT. That would be the best equation. At least those parents know what it is like.     hope that helps.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello everyone, I\'m new to the forum and first time posting.  I\'ve been wrestling with some things and because of the fact I have an autistic son, I figured the best place to get brutal and honest answers would be a forum with other parents of autistic children.  So, here goes.  This question is primarily for the divorced MOMS of autistic children, but I\'d be interested in the input from divorced dads of autistic kids as well.  I\'ve been married for 14 years.  My son is 12 and is autistic.  He\'s very intelligent and for the most part self-sufficient with his daily activities and such, but he is non-verbal.  He is in a basic skills - type learning classroom environment and is generally doing well.  He has his quirks, limitations, and meltdowns etc. but is also a very attentive and loving kid, much more so than the \'typical\' child with autism.  I am contemplating divorcing his mother.  Now, let me make a few points here.  This is not because of infidelity or inappropriate action on my part, or hers.  This is not because of a desire for myself to \'be free\' and explore other romantic avenues.  This is not a way for me to give up my part of the responsibility of raising an autistic child and heap the bulk of it on her (I do not plan on trying to take primary custody; she is a good mom).  This is simply because of changes in both of us that have made it pretty clear to me that she is no longer the \'woman I want to grow old with\'.  In many ways, over the years I have come to resent her and have lost some of the love I once had.  I still love her, and I suppose I always will.  But I have lost a lot of respect for her as a partner.  It\'s for these reasons I have come to the realization that I may have no choice but to divorce.  It is getting harder and harder to come home to a person who regularly points out my faults and shortcomings (don\'t we all have them?) but not her own - which I have fought for years to bite my tongue, to keep the peace.  I find myself bitter and resentful more and more.  NOT because of my son\'s autism - it would be easy to try to place blame there, but it\'s not the case.  I have spent five years soul-searching only to arrive at this point.  The thing that keeps me from actually moving out and filing for divorce is the horrible guilt I have for even thinking about this.  But then I have to balance that with the fact that I quite literally hate the relationship I now have with my wife.  So I\'m caught in a \'darn if you do, darn if you don\'t\' situation.  So this far, I \'haven\'t\' LOL.    For the divorced moms of autistic kids here, please share your experiences in any way you think would help me.  I don\'t want to add to my wife\'s already stressful life (which of course divorce will do) but I can\'t keep piling things on myself.  I\'m at a breaking point.  Is there anything I can do or say that will get through to her?  Keep in mind, she\'s not the \'one with the problem\'.....LOL.  For the divorced dads or autistic kids here, please do the same.  I\'m at a definitive crossroads here.  I\'m not sure where to go or what to do.  I only know what I want to do, and I want to make sure I am fully aware of all the consequences to EVERYONE....not just myself.  Thanks to all of you in advance.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">HTRTC,  I had the chills running up my spine reading your post about the ped\'s office.  Even by not making the rally, you are doing your part by letting the ped know that you are not going to stand for that sort of treatment.  Can you imagine what would happen if every parent stood up and said, \"ENOUGH!\"  (Just like Jennifer Lopez in that movie about domestic abuse. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /> )  If all of us stood up like you did, we would be kicking some serious booty!  Even if that means, not going to the ped for check ups but going to an alternate health doctor.  Or denying prescription antibiotics for minor infections and opting for natural ones instead.  Things like that are happening more and more but still not enough.  I agree with everything you said.  I actually brought in proof that Gavin had heavy metal poisoning by bringing in the hair analysis to his ped.  She said, \"Why don\'t you just take him back to the doctor who gave you that report. I am not going to help you with that.\"  She had a full house of patients in the waiting room.  ANd I said, \"YOu are refusing to treat my son?  He\'s been poisoned and he needs your help.  I will pay for you to take the tests again!\"  Of course your voice is always louder than normal when you are upset.  We were standing by the desk and everyone was staring.  I said, \"Well then I am going to transfer his records to a doctor who is willing to help him.\"  Course I didn\'t know that I would have yet another screaming match with his second doctor several months later.  He had forgot that my son was autistic then proceeded to yell at me how horrible I was for doing chelation on him.  Again, had the entire lobby watching......transferred the medical records yet again.....(sigh!)  I think every doctor who refuses to help should lose their license.  IF they don\'t know how to help, that is one thing.  But refusing to take blood tests, do mineral work ups, check for toxicity that is another.  Those refusals of care should be grounds for medical malpractice.  And what is so scary is he was so physically ill.  You could tell by looking at him.  So to say no to a child who looked sick just because he had the diagnosis of autism is inhumane.  I laugh when I think about their oath to \"do no harm.\"  Since when is putting toxins in, but not taking them out DOING NO HARM!  Makes me sick!  I am so glad I am not a part of that world anymore.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Tami</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Tami</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Do you have a pediatrician? You should first get a referral to a developmental pediatrician and then get  diagnosis (or not get one. )    Preferably your husband can there at the developmental ped\'s office so he can HEAR the doc tell you what is wrong. Whatever the problem, you need to know what it is to form your next plan of attack.  If he does not go with you, get it in writing to show to him. Ask for the diagnosis in writing for your files/ for the schools, etc. They should give that to you.    It\'s tough to be home alone w/ children, but let your house go a little and focus on the medical problem first.  The children need to come first.      As for meds, do it. I\'ve been on zoloft for a while and it helped me to get through our initial crisis of finding out about my son.  I put myself on them immediately.  You might want to get help for yourself first so you can get the concentration you need to help your daughter.    Don\'t worry about what your husband says, about what anyone says. Time to turn into Mama Bear. You can sit around and wonder or you can take action.

I\'m also going to sign him up for swimming lessons, and his gymnastics centre are organising a camp for 4 hours a day for autism students and they are going to be doing hikes, bike riding, crafts and gymnastics of course.  Next year when I am working I am planning on putting him in summer school at his school they go for 6 weeks, 4 hours a day.

It\'s a wonderful protocol, but you can\'t lax off of it in what direction you\'re going.  I did that a little this summer as we had so much going on, and now I\'m back in the books again reviewing Yasko 101.     Yesterday Joey asked his big brother what his teacher\'s name was. Of course, he doesn\'t realize that high school kids have more than one teacher. But it was a rare question posed to his brother that was highly relevant and just so great to hear. He is just doing that well.     We still are having problems with stimming. Some days he is so high-stim I can\'t stand it. Other days he hardly does it at all. If it weren\'t for the darn stimming . . . HIs speech is starting to really clear as well. Not perfect, but he\'s so much more aware of it.     But I\'m back here because I think I need to rejeuvanate. We need to tighten up our diet screws and get back into business, and I need to really stay focused on it while his dad is gone.  I can be that much more devoted now w/o hubby screaming in my ears about everything.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I think you\'re doing the right thing by tuning out his meltdowns.  That\'s what I have learned to do as well, and we have much less of them.  Don\'t let the gatekeepers get you down.  Video his behavior at home, with a functional time-out (which should be used sparingly with our kids, imo) and with how meltdowns are dealt with.  Argue consistency, get the social worker on your side.  Push for the behaviorist.  Although I suspect this is less behavior issues and more of something else.   A meltdown in an autistic kid is NEVER a reason for punishment.  And if he\'s having more of them at school then at home, then the school is negligent somewhere.  Either with poor sensory integration, too large of a class, or too unstructured...  Bottom line, they aren\'t meeting his needs somewhere.  The problem is finding out where!  How does he communicate, how do they facilitate communication?  Is he sensory seeking in all areas? Or overloaded in others?  How is he prepped for expectations, do expectations change without warning?  Is he given an object or picture schedule to ease with transitions?  How do the typically developing peers in his class treat him?  Make them document what triggered the meltdown that required the restraint and work on removing the trigger.  I believe a pattern will emerge.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mimi  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://cadesmom.wordpress.com/\">http://cadesmom.wordpress.com/</a><!-- m --></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mimi  http://cadesmom.wordpress.com/</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Ten Things Every Child with Autism Wishes You Knew    By Ellen Notbohm   South Florida Parenting       Some days it seems the only predictable thing about it is the unpredictability. The only consistent attribute, the inconsistency. There is little argument on any level but that autism is baffling, even to those who spend their lives around it.    The child who lives with autism may look \"normal,\" but his or her behavior can be perplexing and downright difficult. Today, the citadel of autism, once thought an \"incurable\" disorder, is cracking around the foundation. Every day, individuals with autism show us they can overcome, compensate for, and otherwise manage many of the condition\'s most challenging aspects. Equipping those around our children with a simple understanding of autism\'s most basic elements has a tremendous effect on the children\'s journey towards productive, independent adulthood. Autism is an extremely complex disorder, but we can distill it to three critical components: sensory processing difficulties, speech/language delays and impairments, and whole child/social interaction issues.    Here are 10 things every child with autism wishes you knew.    1. I am a child with autism. I am not \"autistic.\" My autism is one aspect of my total character. It does not define me as a person. Are you a person with thoughts, feelings and many talents, or are you just fat (overweight), myopic (wear glasses) or klutzy (uncoordinated, not good at sports)?    2. My sensory perceptions are disordered. This means the ordinary sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touches of everyday life that you may not even notice can be downright painful for me. The very environment in which I have to live often seems hostile. I may appear withdrawn or belligerent to you, but I am really just trying to defend myself. A \"simple\" trip to the grocery store may be hell for me. My hearing may be hyperacute. Dozens of people are talking at once. The loudspeaker booms today\'s special. Muzak whines from the sound system. Cash registers beep and cough. A coffee grinder is chugging. The meat cutter screeches, babies wail, carts creak, the fluorescent lighting hums. My brain can\'t filter all the input, and I\'m in overload! My sense of smell may be highly sensitive. The fish at the meat counter isn\'t quite fresh, the guy standing next to us hasn\'t showered today, the deli is handing out sausage samples, the baby in line ahead of us has a poopy diaper, they\'re mopping up pickles on Aisle 3 with ammonia. ... I can\'t sort it all out, I\'m too nauseous.    Because I am visually oriented, this may be my first sense to become overstimulated. The fluorescent light is too bright. It makes the room pulsate and hurts my eyes. Sometimes the pulsating light bounces off everything and distorts what I am seeing. The space seems to be constantly changing. There\'s glare from windows, moving fans on the ceiling, so many bodies in constant motion, too many items for me to be able to focus - and I may compensate with tunnel vision. All this affects my vestibular sense, and now I can\'t even tell where my body is in space. I may stumble, bump into things, or simply lay down to try and regroup.    3. Please remember to distinguish between won\'t (I choose not to) and can\'t (I\'m not able to). Receptive and expressive language are both difficult for me. It isn\'t that I don\'t listen to instructions. It\'s that I can\'t understand you. When you call to me from across the room, this is what I hear: \"*&amp;^%$#@, Billy. #$%^*&amp;^%$&amp;*\" Instead, come speak directly to me in plain words: \"Please put your book in your desk, Billy. It\'s time to go to lunch.\" This tells me what you want me to do and what is going to happen next. Now it\'s much easier for me to comply.    4. I am a concrete thinker. I interpret language literally. It\'s very confusing for me when you say, \"Hold your horses, cowboy!\" when what you really mean is \"Please stop running.\" Don\'t tell me something is a \"piece of cake\" when there is no dessert in sight and what you really mean is, \"This will be easy for you to do.\" When you say, \"It\'s pouring cats and dogs,\" I see pets coming out of a pitcher. Please just tell me, \"It\'s raining very hard.\" Idioms, puns, nuances, double entendres and sarcasm are lost on me.    5. Be patient with my limited vocabulary. It\'s hard for me to tell you what I need when I don\'t know the words to describe my feelings. I may be hungry, frustrated, frightened or confused, but right now those words are beyond my ability to express. Be alert for body language, withdrawal, agitation, or other signs that something is wrong.    There\'s a flip side to this: I may sound like a little professor or a movie star, rattling off words or whole scripts well beyond my developmental age. These are messages I have memorized from the world around me to compensate for my language deficits, because I know I am expected to respond when spoken to. They may come from books, television or the speech of other people. It\'s called echolalia. I don\'t necessarily understand the context or the terminology I\'m using, I just know it gets me off the hook for coming up with a reply.    6. Because language is so difficult for me, I am very visually oriented. Show me how to do something rather than just telling me. And please be prepared to show me many times. Lots of patient repetition helps me learn.    A visual schedule is extremely helpful as I move through my day. Like your day planner, it relieves me of the stress of having to remember what comes next, makes for smooth transitions between activities, and helps me manage my time and meet your expectations. Here\'s a great web site for learning more about visual schedules <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.cesa7.k12.wi.us/newweb/content/rsn/autism.asp\">http://www.cesa7.k12.wi.us/newweb/conte ... autism.asp</a><!-- m -->    7. Focus and build on what I can do rather than what I can\'t do. Like any other human, I can\'t learn in an environment where I\'m constantly made to feel that I\'m not good enough or that I need fixing. Trying anything new when I am almost sure to be met with criticism, however constructive, becomes something to be avoided. Look for my strengths and you\'ll find them. There\'s more than one right way to do most things.    8. Help me with social interactions. It may look like I don\'t want to play with the other kids on the playground, but sometimes it\'s just that I simply don\'t know how to start a conversation or enter a play situation. If you can encourage other children to invite me to join them at kickball or shooting baskets, I may be delighted to be included.    9. Try to identify what triggers my meltdowns. This is termed \"the antecedent.\" Meltdowns, blowups, tantrums or whatever you want to call them are even more horrid for me than they are for you. They occur because one or more of my senses has gone into overload. If you can figure out why my meltdowns occur, they can be prevented.    10. If you are a family member, please love me unconditionally. Banish thoughts such as, \"If he would just ...\" and \"Why can\'t she ... ?\" You didn\'t fulfill every last expectation your parents had for you, and you wouldn\'t like being constantly reminded of it. I didn\'t choose to have autism. Remember that it\'s happening to me, not you. Without your support, my chances of successful, self-reliant adulthood are slim. With your support and guidance, the possibilities are broader than you might think. I promise you I\'m worth it.    It all comes down to three words: Patience. Patience. Patience.    Work to view my autism as a different ability rather than a disability. Look past what you may see as limitations and see the gifts autism has given me. I may not be good at eye contact or conversation, but have you noticed I don\'t lie, cheat at games, tattle on my classmates, or pass judgment on other people?    You are my foundation. Think through some of those societal rules, and if they don\'t make sense for me, let them go. Be my advocate, be my friend, and we\'ll see just how far I can go.    I probably won\'t be the next Michael Jordan, but with my attention to fine detail and capacity for extraordinary focus, I might be the next Einstein. Or Mozart. Or Van Gogh.

Gutstein would be so proud of you ! The \"master -apprentice\" relationship (as he calls what you are basically describing) is quintessential to RDI.     As far as it being the new fad in autism treatments- I don\'t think so. I don\'t like people who proselitize and am not a Gutstein personal fan, but the reason I think this will hold up is that every statement he was making was backed up by research both in typical and atypical (autistic) development. None of his statements was left up in the air. Everything he said to do he explained why it needed done and it made a lot of sense. I started out very skeptical and pretty put off by his anti-ABA comments (that I still don\'t agree with). There is nothing evasive about what he posits, though he loves to hear himself talk and sometimes it can get pretty long.    Anyway, there are several ways to skin a cat, I\'m sure. Deb, he doesn\'t say not to do other interventions. What he says, is that you need RDI to truly remediate autism. He feels (here I disagree, but just quoting him) that speech delays, sensory problem, ADHD issues etc are all \"comorbidities\" that all need to be addressed separately. In his initial book he leaves the door open for ABA, it\'s only more recently that he seems to be against it. Maybe because it\'\'s the biggest \"competitor\" out there?

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thank you all so much for sharing your experiences with me.  It is amazing how many different ways autism can present itself.  I feel better just knowing that there is nothing I can or should be doing now that I am not and that just giving lots of love and attention is the best \"medicine\" at this time.  I volunteer at a clothes/toy/equipment resale thru our church that raises about $10,000 per year.  We choose 2 different charities each year to donate to that focus on helping children.  I want to recommend an autism charity for the next sale.  Can anyone tell me what is the best one that does the most for kids with the minimal amount of money spent on administrative costs?</div>'

I understand your confusion. If it helps, remember that you have the same son today that you had a week ago before the appointment. No one -- not even the doctors -- can tell you if your son will end up with no autism, mild autism or a serious disability 10 years from now. So try not to think about the what-ifs. Does anyone really know what any day will bring?  Why not make the appointments for the developmental evaluation and hold off on the worrying until you find out what you might or might not be dealing with? I know, easier said than done, especially if you\'re a worrier by nature.

He now tells us he used to hit because someone\'s voice hurt his ears, his shoes were bothering him, the lights at the doctor\'s office were painful to his eyes, that kind of thing. Your post reminded me of those days because he also would get angry when I would talk to someone. He felt excluded and confused, he now tells us. He\'s still pretty anxious when we go to doctor appointments, but he\'s able to ask me a lot of questions first: (What will happen? Who will I see? Will it hurt? What comes afterward?) I don\'t know if your son is also feeling anxiety, but I thought I would mention this in case he\'s having similar feelings.    Also, with the diet, if your son has constipation, you may want to avoid rice milk for a while: it can make matters worse.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ â€œThe seeking is the goal and the search is the answerâ€</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ aThe seeking is the goal and the search is the answera</div>'

Also I think of it this way. Its a little scary to me now not knowing what my son\'s future will be like, but for all we know both our sons could be exactly like Raun when they get to be his age now.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed. -Theodore Roosevelt</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed. -Theodore Roosevelt</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Alex\'s mom-  I will give this my best shot, as I can see it\'s really \"bugging\" you.  Is it a possibility that Alex is wanting to show off some new skills?  You said that the teacher say that the dangling of an award is working like a charm at school, so maybe Alex just wants the same type of routine at home.  I am only guessing here, so please bear with me.  Flexibility is a learned skill for most of our kids.  I mean ASD kids for the most part, but there are plenty of NT kids who are much the same.  They thrive on structure and routine.  Right now, it doesn\'t appear that Alex is able to complete a \'task\' i.e., a chat, without some sort of ending point defined and another \'task\' in line after it.  Maybe if you could actually set an end-point for him, say, let\'s chat and have some strawberries for 20 minutes or so, then we can start dinner.  Or build a puzzle or whatever.  That way, he is getting the award AS he is completeing his \'task\' of just sitting and chatting with you.  Then there is another task in his queue that may not have an obvious award.  Example, a puzzle.  The completed puzzle is the award itself.  The other example, dinner is the award.  Does that make sense?  (I guess I\'m really no better at being clear...)  I am reading over the other commenters suggestions, which are also very good.    I think that you are going to have to ease slowly into unstructured free time or simply hanging out.  Don\'t get discouraged.  He may always have a need for some sort of schedule, which is not necessarily a bad thing, IMO.  Many people are not spontaneous.  I have good friend who, to this day, blanches at the prospect of just taking off and doing things with no prior plans to do so.  To her credit, she tries, but it makes her uncomfortable.  She needs that planning phase to feel in control.  As for the reinforcers becoming too prevalent, it depends on how much your son understands and is able to separate school life from home.  Rules are complex.  There are different sets of rules for school and home, and some kids will bring the school rules and routines home with them.  My daughter used to raise her hand at the dinner table when she wanted to say something!    Be patient.  It sounds as though he is making wonderful progress at school and enjoys it.  He will gradually learn that it\'s okay to just hang out and do nothing, with no awards for doing so.  Don\'t take it personally that he doesn\'t yet see being with you as an award itself, he will eventually.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">You have mentioned a few red flags - like guiding your hand to what he wants, verbal stimming and appearing deaf. In fact, the way you describe him sounds very much like my own son at 2. But, you need to have him professionally evaluated as soon as possible. And yes, starting therapies right away is best. A diagnosis will help you obtain these services for free or at a reduced rate. And, you can start treating him biomedically immediately - making sure that he is getting the proper nutrients  I know it feels like it is the end of the world. We have all been there! It is truly a painful process that you must endure, but things do get better. Your outlook changes - and so does your son. It sounds like if he is affected, it is not a severe case. And there is a lot you can do to turn it around.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I think all of us here can relate to feeling very overwhelmed when our child was first diagnosed. I know you say you don\'t have time for support groups, but I stongly encourage you to try to meet some other parents of children with autism in your area, I know that was life saving for me when my son was first diagnosed. Try asking some of your son\'s therapists if they know of other Mom\'s who might be interested in at least talking on the phone with you, or meeting with you at a time that might work out for you. Don\'t feel guilty about feeling trapped and wanting at least a little time for yourself. Remember you need to take care of yourself too or you won\'t be able to care for your children effectively.   This is an extremely stressful time for you, don\'t try to learn everything at once, just take it one step at a time. Things will get better, you will get into the groove of things with therapies and preschool, etc. I also have 3 children, a 17yo daughter, and twin boys who are 11, one of my boys has autism. I remember very well feeling overwhelmed, trapped, guilty, etc. when my son was first diagnosed. It\'s okay to tell your husband, or anyone else that can help with your kids, that you need a break. You really do need to talk to someone else who can really understand what you are going through.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Posted: Wed Oct 12, 2005 1:46 pm    Post subject: recent autism diagnosis       --------------------------------------------------------------------------------     Please forgive my lack of organization in my post . This is all so new and there are so many different thoughts and feelings .As I have said in my first posting our soon to be 3 yr old daughter 2 days ago recieved an Autism diagnosis . I was so pleased to see all the feedback i have recieved in this forum , and thank everyone. My wife has stopped crying , she is much younger than I and is 8 wks pregnant .   I feel she/we have entered a state of denial but I am not sure exactly how we are feeling . We have heard several stories of a mis-diagnosis. This seems to be such a vague disorder. Regardless today we started PT and OT and have already started the process of her registration with the local special needs program. Its weird seeing the look on these people\'s faces when you tell them your child has autism.   I would like to tell everyone her symptoms ,and get some feedback.   She is 34 months &amp; an only child ,I am listing them in no particuliar order.     she only says a few words and babbles a lot.   She seems to be happy most of the time   Physically she is big for her age and has a good appetit   She walks on her tippy toes when barefoot   The physical therapist says she is only a few months behind and will not need much physical therapy.   She is affectionate towards us and others close to her but is not so excited when we come home   Large groups of people do not bother her   She doesn\' t like to play with other children but also has little contact with them she prefers to play alone   She is not attached to any particuliar object and routine doesn\'t matter to her   She very rarley throws tandrums   She does make Eye contact but not for that long   She does not always repond to her name     New people do not bother her / though she may almost ignore them at times   She is usually well behaved and we have taken her everywhere . recently she spent a month in Europe with us visiting family and she was great the whole time     I know a lot of her characteritics fit the \"autistic profile \" but could it be something else?   In the last 48 hours i have read so much and spoken to many people . There are so many opinions . I am hoping for the best put preparing for the worst. We are aggresively persuing the proper treatment   Today we met with an occupational therapist as well and she said she seemed to be a child that would be easy to work with .   Should I bother for a second opinion ? If she is not Autistic we know she has some sort of learning/developmental disorder and these steps can only help.      Back to top</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I love this article, it gives those of us with children with speech issues hope:    WHEN SPEECH GETS STUCK      By Marge Blanc, M.A., CCC-SLP    A HIERARCHY OF PRACTICAL SUPPORTS FOR   DYSPRAXIA IN CHILDREN WITH ASD    PART 1      THE STORY THAT FOLLOWS HAPPENED EXACTLY THIS WAY... IT\'S ALL TRUE, EXCEPT FOR THE NAMES.    I walked through Eddie\'s backyard, where I had gone for a first home visit. I had just met Eddie and his sister, his mom and his dad. Eddie imitated my name quietly, almost in a whisper, saying \"Mah\" as we ran along. Without any signs of obvious enthusiasm, he went over to his swing set, whispering a short syllable. It was such a quiet voice that I almost missed it. But his quiet \"sih\" (for \"swing\") was unmistakable to ears that have become acutely tuned to such fleeting, subtle pronouncements.    \"I hope you can teach Eddie to talk,\" said Eddie\'s mother; and his father echoed an equally fervent plea. How was I going to tell them that Eddie already did talk? I had been in this situation many times before, and knew that an instant retort would be ill-timed, and seem lacking in credibility. I knew I\'d have to wait until I knew Eddie, and his parents, better.      PARENTS ARE CLEARLY NOT TO BLAME for not \"hearing\" Eddie and others like him. In fact, we are all \"programmed\" to think that talking comes in a certain form, with a certain loudness, with a certain rapidity, and, of course, with accompanying eye contact and referencing (pointing, gesturing, etc.). We think this is always true because it almost always is! Our phone systems expect that we will pause no longer than two seconds. If we do, they cut us off. Our voice mail systems expect us to never talk at a high frequency, or too loudly, or too softly. If we do, they cut us off. It is just \"not done.\"    And, we are programmed as parents and teachers to expect that kids will make eye contact and gesture long before they begin talking...a handy order-of-events for us, so we\'ll know that they are talking, that they\'re talking to us, what they\'re talking about, and that they want us to listen and to respond.      But, those of us who know and love at least one child on the spectrum know we don\'t have the benefit of this \"expected\"  order of events.  Rather, out-of-the-blue one day, we may hear a sound, a word, even a phrase or sound contour...and never again. We think our ears have deceived us...and we are sure that we should not take it seriously. We think we can\'t afford to delude ourselves into thinking our child actually talked, or has the ability to use the language it would have required. We are, somehow, \"bound\" by our child\'s diagnosis to think that our child\'s language must be \"disordered,\" and that since his speech doesn\'t sound like real words to us, that it is \"babbling\" or \"jargon.\"    BACK TO EDDIE... Unlike his parents, I didn\'t have to worry about being deluded. I had heard dozens of children like Eddie say things that were later validated by repeated, clear productions, and/or other signs of communicative intent, like independent typing. Waiting for that next time a child said a particular word or phrase, though, sometimes seemed to take forever.  Usually it did not, however. I learned that if the people surrounding a child believed his words to be real, they would reappear sooner. That was the key!    What if Eddie really didn\'t say my name, though...or didn\'t tell me what he wanted to do? Would it do him any harm if I thought he had and responded accordingly? Does it do infants any harm when moms hear \"mamamama,\" and presume [read: \"hope\"] it means, \"Mama?\" No, of course not. It is this delighted parental reaction to sound that teaches kids that speech has meaning. It is how children learn to talk!    Shouldn\'t our \"non-verbal\" ASD kids have the same opportunity? Of course they should! And it should be delivered with even greater regularity and \"benefit of the doubt.\" I\'ve witnessed, first hand, the positive results that can be achieved with our kids when we presume their communicative intent and respond accordingly. (Blanc, 2004.)      WE HAVE ALL READ that, historically, nearly half the individuals with Autism Spectrum diagnoses have failed to develop useful oral language. They have been known as \"non-verbal.\" And we have all known that motor coordination problems are prevalent across the spectrum, with Occupational Therapy leading the way towards understanding the complexity of \"praxis\" or motor planning. But it was not until 1997 that Speech-Language Pathologist Gail Richard reported in her book, The Source for Autism, that the 40% or so on the spectrum who are significantly challenged with Apraxia of Speech (Verbal Dyspraxia) are the same 40% who have not developed useful speech.    Looking at Eddie, one can understand why. Eddie\'s voice was extremely quiet...not just because his confidence in being understood was so limited. His muscle tone was low, making all his movements slower and weaker, and the timing of his verbalizations seemed \"random,\" so no one knew when to listen. Essentially, no one could hear him. Without some encouragement and feedback, Eddie was not going to become a competent speaker on his own.  But kids like Eddie are not alone any more. Our kids with apraxia now stand an excellent chance of defying the odds of the past and becoming verbal!    How? The rest of this article will address that. First of all, know that there are now excellent resources and many trained SLP\'s, OT\'s, and PT\'s to help. If your child\'s therapist is trained in Sensory Integration, your child will have a good start. Why? Because we now know that the sensory/motor \"pieces\" that challenge your child in his overall sensory and motor learning affect \"praxis\" as well.  And what is praxis, you ask, and how does this translate into speech?    PRAXIS, as defined by OT\'s (after the pioneering work of Jean Ayres), and now used by the rest of us, refers to motor plans...that is, formulating an idea, or an \"intention\" to do something unique with one\'s body, initiating it, following through with it, and ending it. It is important to note that dyspraxia is a disorder of motor planning, not automatic motor execution. If a motor pattern has been practiced long enough to become automatic, it is no longer a \"plan.\" Our kids are readily able to return to familiar motor patterns. We see this is so easy, in fact, that they become \"repetitive behaviors,\" and may risk being labeled \"stereotypical movements\" or \"stims.\"     Let\'s look at an example at a whole-body or gross motor level. A motor plan might be formulated when a child sees a favorite food (a cookie) on a counter top in the kitchen and decides to climb up to get it.  Initiating the plan might mean climbing up on the chair that\'s conveniently, but uncharacteristically, right in front of the cookie. Following through with the plan would include getting over to the chair, climbing up, reaching for the cookie and successfully getting it. Ending the plan would mean NOT continuing to climb up higher, NOT crawling over the top of the counter, but stopping long enough to eat.    DO YOU SEE YOUR CHILD IN THIS SCENARIO? I see some children who go over to the chair but never get to the point of standing on the seat. I see others who get up onto the chair successfully, but who don\'t stop climbing. I see many others who start towards the chair, but get \"sidetracked\" along the way, making their original intentions a challenge for us to read. I remember vividly the first time a child, with severe motor planning challenges, told me, \"I\'m stuck,\" as he literally could NOT move from his sitting position at the top of a slide.     It is important to observe kids closely, since we will see kids getting \'stuck\' far more often than we will have the opportunity to hear them tell us about it. This is because such kids are usually rendered speechless too. Yes, praxis can affect the coordination of any muscles of the body, including those that produce speech. An amazing array of muscles needs to coordinate before a child can talk fluently...muscles of breathing (specifically exhalation), muscles of voicing/phonation (vocal folds), and the muscles of articulation (oral speech), including those of the jaw, tongue, and lips. So, it is a rare child who can tell you that the rest of his body is \"stuck.\" His muscles of speech are probably \"stuck\" too, even more so.    When the \"stuckedness\" occurs at the level of breathing, there is insufficient air with which to produce voice. Kids might move their lips, but nothing comes out. The stuckedness can occur at the level of phonation, too, so sometimes a child can whisper, but not say something out loud or loudly enough to be heard. SLP\'s are quite used to another kind of stuckedness, that of the speech articulators. Kids might be able to produce a nice voice but without a coordinated flow of sounds or syllables.  \"Classic\" apraxia of speech is like this...unintelligible, disjointed sequences of sounds, with a quality that is flat and forced. But, even kids who are typically unintelligible, or even silent, occasionally have \"islands of fluency,\" when it all comes together perfectly...once in a blue moon. They enjoy their moment in the sun, never able to recreate it again.    ALL OF THESE SCENARIOS, and dozens more, are within the rubric of apraxia, or, more accurately, dyspraxia, referring to problems with praxis, but not lack of it altogether. It all seems very confusing, I know. But, getting our kids \'unstuck\' is possible, using a hierarchy of supports that we have developed in our clinic and use with our ASD kids with dyspraxia every day.    We\'ve witnessed that severely dyspraxic kids do make progress...tremendous progress...as long as the supporting levels for physical development and coordination are honored and provided. It cannot be stressed enough that \"speech is movement,\" and, as such, \"speech therapy\" is movement therapy...fun movement therapy! Praxis is about figuring out how muscles move together, and, for our kids (all 40% of them) who are \"stuck,\" we need to provide frequent and appropriate movement opportunities that give them all the feedback their growing bodies need. When provided with enough of the right supports (including the help they need to access them), kids will move (although it may not be steadily) through the hierarchy, eventually achieving fluent speech that honors their drive to communicate and matches their internal intentions. This process will likely take years, which seems discouraging, I know. But, I can tell you from considerable experience that in the context of the interaction, communication, and play where most of this â€˜trainingâ€™ occurs, kids love it! And it\'s clearly better than the alternative - remaining minimally verbal.    Before addressing the hierarchy in depth, it\'s important to review some of the foundation \"pieces\". These come to us from the extensive work of OT\'s like Jean Ayres, and are now being incorporated into the work of many SLP\'s.  It helps to look at it this way: in the example above, if the child trying to get to the cookie can\'t see where the chair is in relationship to the cookie, doesn\'t yet know how to climb, and doesn\'t have the strength to hold out his arm or grasp with his fingers, the \"plan\" could never materialize. In other words, praxis depends on a \"body schema\" (Where are my knee joints? Where are my fingers?) and a sense of where one\'s body is in relationship to the room, the chair, and the cookie. All the senses must be working well enough to know these things. Successful praxis particularly involves the tactile (skin) sense, proprioceptive (joints and muscles) sense, and vestibular (balance) sense.     WHAT SLP\'S ARE REALIZING is that the same is true for the mouth - a pretty mysterious space if you can\'t feel and move it\'s parts - and the internal connections among breathing, voice, and articulation. Most of us were never faced with \"planning\" how to move our jaws and tongues in order to learn to talk. But for our kids, it is a truly awesome task, when you think about it.  Nothing, even deep breathing, is automatic, and exercising until it becomes automatic seems to take forever. Our kids have to actually \"plan\" to exhale (witness the kids trying to talk on inhalation rather than exhalation). When it comes to coordination with voice (to make a sound of any kind), the \"work\" is intensified. That our kids want to talk so badly that they voluntarily practice each step over and over and over is a tribute to their deep intentions and will! Fortunately, we can make their practice fun and rewarding, and they can learn the power of speech early on.    Amazingly, our kids tackle even more than these praxis challenges on their way to becoming fluent speakers. If the oral senses are not fully developed, or are overly sensitive, \"oral motor\" therapy can do for the mouth what PT/OT does for the rest of the body. Oral motor therapy can be \"hands on\" (Beckman) or \"hands off\" (Marshalla, 1999), but typically cannot be overlooked completely. Even if every sensation the mouth feels is noxious to a child (sensory defensiveness), this can be successfully addressed with the Wilbarger Protocol (Wilbarger, 1991). And, you can rest assured that oral motor therapy and praxis therapy work together and concurrently.    Back to our main topic. The supports for dyspraxia begin at the level of the whole body; sensory/motor work at a gross motor level will get your child started. The hierarchy works with the knowledge that gross motor comes before fine motor development, and that speech articulation is the \"finest of the fine,\" when it comes to the numbers of small muscles that must work together for intelligible speech to occur. As will become apparent in reading the hierarchy, speech is a multilayered phenomenon, only a part of which is movement of the muscles of the lips, tongue, and jaw. If we only view articulation as the complete definition of \"speech,\" we risk teaching splinter skills, verbalizations that the child will not be able to access in any way other than the one in which they were learned (think of kids who can say \"m\" only when prompted, \"say \'m\'\").  Such skills â€“ usually taught before a child was developmentally ready - are limited and more importantly, limiting, because they are not a part of hierarchical, supported development.    THE REASON THE HIERARCHY WORKS is because each level has been adequately practiced and developed, in the context of fun and play, before it is used to support the next higher level.  While there is clearly cross-over among the levels, each successive level is targeted until it is reliable enough to support the next.  Conversely, when something becomes challenging at any particular level, there is a next-lower level to fall back on to find comfortable production. We always find it helpful to talk about these forward and backward movements with kids, so they know that it is OK, even expected. It is not \"regression.\" It is just part of the process.     Part 2 of this article will start with broadening the typical concept of \"speaking,\" so that you will be able to rejoice along with your child as you embark on the first of the eight levels that make up the hierarchy of supports for dyspraxia. You will learn that we all use our breathing and our voices to communicate, even when we never open our mouths! Weâ€™ll then share some successful tricks of the trade to help dyspraxic kids move from being \'stuck\' to becoming fluent speakers!</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Tami - There are so many instances of what you asked that I couldn\'t even begin to fit them on this post.  The first happened when I was a very little girl (I don\'t know how I remember this, I was so young).  Many of you may not even remember Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, but, believe it or not ,that was my first questioning.  I remember they lost a little child (maybe my age - I don\'t remember) in a Sunday School bus accident.  This little girl who was me wondered what good is a God that couldn\'t even protect little children on their way to His House?    Skip ahead many years...I worked for Mothers Against Drunk Driving and couldn\'t, once again as I had many other times during the years past, understand why God couldn\'t protect these innocent people killed by drunk drivers....send an angel to tell them to turn left instead of right i.e.    Naturally, there a lot of times I used to ask \"why\" for personal things as well as for other people.  Even though my previous post ended saying I ask why.  I really don\'t anymore.  I learned a long time ago there are no answers and I personally don\'t believe things happen for a reason....I believe they just happen!  I know you guys won\'t like this <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /> but, I don\'t believe God has control over the evil or the good that happens.  I think things \"just happen\" and we must deal with them the best we can - with God\'s help if we so believe.  I feel if I thank him for the good I must also blame him for the bad and I don\'t want to do that so I just don\'t...period.    As a private question, Tami, do you think you would have reached the point you are at if Gavin did not improve as you prayed? If this is too personal, please don\'t feel you must answer.    P.S.  I love ya too!  I was just thinking it must be about 2 years since I met you and the kids at McDonald\'s.  Please don\'t tell me it is three!!!!</div>      <span class=\"gensmall\">Last edited by <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10&amp;sid=db9c2f38f82b66495aa6b730f20d68ea\">Grandma C</a> on Thu Jan 29, 2009 9:39 am, edited 1 time in total.</span>'

I find it deplorable to take advantage of parents like this who have few other options. Our local school system is overwhelmed and special needs programs are being trimmed back, from what I hear.   I feel if parents have input, if parents are allowed to volunteer at the school, it will lead to an increased sense of ownership and community at the school.

Random Advice that comes to mind... not how to get started but just things I wish I had known...    Be careful never to allow your children to hear you discussing them.  I made the mistake of not thinking he was paying attention or comprehending many things over the years, and he talks about them now.  They can comprehend a lot more than it appears and are quite probably <strong>extremely </strong>intelligent.   In some areas more intelligent than the people who \"treat\" them.       Don\'t believe the information about autism having an 80%+ mental retardation rate.  There\'s a thread on this board about that.  It\'s due to outdated and ineffective tests.  Some are, some aren\'t.  But it appears to be more like 20-30% if that.      They need to feel loved and protected, like any other child.  The methods you use to convey your love and care may not, if you end up on this road, be what you expected, but your child desperately needs you to find a way in, because no one else will.  It\'s a dumb assumption that just because an autistic child does not show affection in the usual ways that he is not in need of and bonded to his parents.  No matter what the diagnosis or lack of diagnosis ends up being for your children, never forget that they are still children, and being autistic doesn\'t mean they cease to need the same love, support, patience, and respect that a \"typical\" child would need.  Many of the professionals in this field actually hold contempt for the children they serve and the families as well.  Many professionals are angels on earth.  You just have to say a prayer, close your eyes, and jump in.    Be careful who you get advice from.  I\'ve found other parents and boards like this the most trustworthy.  But you\'ve probably noticed that there are some extremely polarized opinions all over the autism world, even on this board.  You just have to find the path you think would be best.    Doctors who you THINK would be knowledgable often end up being the source of awful delays in treatment.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Grandma C-  I wish I had more knowledge of speech issues for you.  It would make sense to me that speech would follow after other issues are addressed and mastered.  I know for Jack that much progress was made after his sensory problems were addressed-he could focus on other areas because he was not so bogged down by sensory seeking and defensiveness.  It would seem logical.    Yes-if you ask Jack what he wants to be when he grows up-he will say, \"Movie Maker!\"  He was asked at a party if he wanted to work there baking and he said, \"I\'m sorry-I\'m going to be a movie maker.\"  I wouldn\'t be surprised!

' <div class=\"postbody\">I can so totally relate.  My son came home from school a few weeks back and whispered \"they don\'t like to play with me\" while he was eating his lunch.  Ripped my heart out.  I was in the principal\'s office the next morning asking what he planned to do about this.  We tried to have the talk about mean kids versus nice kids too, but it did not really go over very well.  He could not grasp the concept and he is a lot older than your little boy.    I think the other moms gave great advice.  We have had some success trying to \"facilitate\" peer play.  You really have to get in there though and make yourself appealing to those kids.  Not the easiest thing to do when you are so worried about your own child \"fitting in\".    Hang in there.    Jeffrey\'s mom</div>'

I would point to an object say the word then say \"monkeys turn\" and shine the light on the object and since the monkey made a sound I would say \"oooh he said ______ in monkey talk. Then I would say Your turn to my son and physically make his finger point to the object then model the word for him and see if he tried to say it. He eventually got it and now he still brings me the flash light and says \"monkeys turn\" I think since it was fun for him he enjoyed learning to point....I know it is a goofy way to teach it but hey it worked for us so I wanted to share it with you..... <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarassed\" /></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed. -Theodore Roosevelt</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed. -Theodore Roosevelt</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">You might want to move this post to the biomed side but I have had similar issues with my son and giggling all the time, but I remembered that I\'d heard this was related to yeast along with bright red ears and once I started paying attention sure enough red ears whenever he starts in with the giggles.  So we are also going to go see our DAN next month to get a stool panel so they can figure out which enzymes etc to put him on.  So anyway check up on yeast.  I\'ve also heard that chelation can cause some yeast problems too.  Something about mercury and yeast binding together.  Anyway it\'s been way to long since I heard that to be more specific.  I think it was one of the autism one interviews I can\'t remember who with though.  I hope this helps.  Good Luck.    Also I don\'t know if you\'ve tried the GFCF diet but that really helped my sons out of control behaviors settle down.</div>'

As much as no one can ever say for sure if he will, no one can say for sure that he will not.  Grandma C, I have to say that the best thing that can be done is what his parents and you and your husband are already doing.  You all spend QUALITY time with him.  Just keep TALKING  to him, describe what you are doing, where you are going, what you will see, etc.  Label everything.  Receptively name things for him, and also put written labels on everything he uses in the house.  Use sign language as you talk.  Use sign language paired with pictures in books, magazines....and the sensory.  I would hit the sensory.  He needs and enjoys his sensory activities, make him say \"blanket\" before he will be wrapped in it.  He can sign it, say it or just attempt to day it \"bbbb\".  He is so young still and I know I never meet him, but from what I have heard, I honestly do not feel I am giving you false hope by saying he is on the right track and has great potential!!!      I noticed some new posts on non-verbal language disorder.  I haven\'t looked into those, but there may be some info there that could help with ideas as well.    As far as the *taboo*, I have to admit, if I were dealing with the same dx, I wouldn\'t go that direction either.

' <div class=\"postbody\">FIRST Rule NEVER sign the I.E.P if you are not Fully. and Totally. Or completely 100%  satisfied   with your child\'s I.E.P. The  time period/line   given to you on your childs I.E.P is not meant  for you. I will rephrase this.     When the school distric gives you your childs I.E.P after you have had the team meeting the school will send you home the written I.E.P. it will say (Please sign &amp; Return). The  schools  and your disrtic will tell the parents until you sign we CANNOT provide services This is a (FALSE) statement by the school.     UNDER Federal Law and State and special education law the school/Distric cannot stop your child from getting his/her education because you are not in agrement with what they are offering your child. It is called  tay In /stay put law. Meaning: what ever happens your child must get his education until the problem is resolved. it may be be due to   Mediation/ Lawyers/ a problem -        resolution/Concerns/disagrements/Assetmentsdisagrements/Communication /Services / Ect......  when the school tells the parent to sign the I.E.P  it is because  the  (School) or your (home  Distric)  will NOt have access  to your childs Matrix money if it is not sigh  or  written within a certaine ammount of  time this is why they need you to do this.    if you filed  a  complaint  agains the school you have the right to say the school distric is out of compliance this  gives you  the parent the right to file in a complaint agains them, the teachers. distric &amp;  the school.     On the Team Determination of Education Placement / I.E.P. Or Placement consent Form there is a written place on this form that will read. Parent Optional/Responses. You will see a box that reads.    1- I aceep the I,E.P as developed    2-I reject the  I.E.P as developed     3-- I reject the following portion of the I.E.P with the understanding that any portion (s) that I do not reject will be cosidered accepted and implemented immediately. Reject portions are as follows:    If you the parent DO NOT agree  place a check on the box that applys. and say WHY you are rejecting OR why  you are not in agreement with what the school is recommending.      You have a space on this page. it is called.( Parents Comments)  It is written:     I would like to make the following comments(s) but realize any comment(s) made that suggest changes to the proposed  I.E.P will not be implemented unless the I.E.P is amended.     This  is a space we the parent\'s have to reply what ever you want to convey to the Dep of special education.       *quote  from you).... I am told a small change ....... That is  bla,  bla,  bla, from the school. if you singn it you will get what is there and the school does not have to consider anything, that is  the LAW. Once you sign it your stuck with this I.E.P  until the next time.  of  course you may ask to meet again they will  tell you they will. but they will NOT. and will give you a very hard time  with it so you will stop persisting    E. Mails  are  good keep them just in case you need to get a  lawyer this will help you.     If  any of the teachers that had to be in your childs meeting  is not at this meeting, if they do not  show  up.  YOU have the right to cancel  that meeting That  is your right by law. all the teachers that work with your child should be a part of his/her I.E.P. That  is why it is called a  TEAM MEETING.      ALL GOALS  should be adressed. the Team MUST cosider your imput . You are a  TEM Member at your  child\'s  Metting. This is FAPE. All written  goals are the schools  concerns and it must be  consider,  &amp; your imput is very meningful.  The school wants you to think it is not. That  is why you the parent have to make sure your request is place in the space i  wrote on. it is a small  space. take a  paper and add on to it.      Keep  the extra copy because if the school does not  like what you are requesting   the papers   WILL get lost.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" />   it happens ALL the time  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" />  Is a school  thing.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /> I  hope this has help you  some.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Whew!  Excellent!    Okay, here is my little list too  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />       We know our teacher.  We have visited the class, taken a tour, touched all manipulatives in the room (montessori).  Walked into the Art room.  Used the boys bathroom.  Visited the Band Room.  Looked at and discussed the lockers.    In his IEP I personally have added three pages of sensory, accomodations, modifications, communication strategies.    We met 2 years ago to set up a Behavioral Intervention Plan.  It is still appropriate at this time and will carry over with minor adjustments.    We have a meeting this month to arrange a schedule so that his aid can walk him over to the new school during the school day and he can visit on a weekly basis.  Maybe 3 days a week where he will go to visit, learn the school, met the teachers and classrooms, sit in his classroom and do one of his works, get to know the kids (blended classroom of 4th, 5th, and 6th graders so he will be with the 4th and 5th graders next year).  Let him go to recess with his future class....etc.    Putting it right out there, I hate the OT.  She is a district OT and the same gal who sees him at his current school.  She is worthless and he gets more out of his \"sessions\" in the OT with his aid.     Sensory is a HUGE part of DS day, it organizes him and calms him.  It has to be incorporated into his work as well.  The biggest challenge has always been getting teachers to accept this.    Another challenge is going to be getting ALL of the future staff to communicate with US next year.   My son is nonverbal so I need daily notes home.    I also need to make sure all staff understands how to communicate with him and is willing to take the time to make schedules (picture).</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Dana</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Dana</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello, I\'m a brand spankin\' new member, and am so glad I found a site like this to help us through this journey.  My son was diagnosed with PDD-NOS at the end of June. Because I am a single mom and have very limited resources, he is covered under our state\'s insurance plan, which doesn\'t cover services for Autism. So now what we have to do is jump through the following hoops:  *Get secondary diagnosis from an aprooved ASD provider (we\'ve been on the waiting list there for 4.f months, and it\'s another 2-3 months until we get an appointment, so we\'re looking at November or December as the appointment date) *Meet with the agency that oversees the state\'s waiver program to fill out paperwork *Submit an application for waiver to the state *Sit back and wait until they aproove or deny it *If aprooved, he has to then sit on a waiting list that is 9-12 months long to get into a waiver slot *Once in the waiver slot, THEN in-home therapy and any other ASD-related services will start, and just have to go through an agency\'s intake, the line therapist hiring, etc.  So we could be looking at 18 months here!                    Bottom line, my son can\'t afford to wait for services any longer than he already has, and I need to hire a therapist out-of-pocked. My family is lucky enough to have a history with a horse farm that does equine-assisted therapy, and they have offered- or beeged- us to bring him to the farm once a week, and have offered their services at 25% of their normal rate if I barter labor services and do volunteer work at the farm (which I used to do years ago anyway, so it\'s perfect!). What an amazing offer from family friends who we already know and are comfortable with!  But... I can\'t even afford to pay the 25% of services. Therefore, I.am looking for ways to fundraise. The farm is a non-profit organization, so that helps things out a lot. I want to do fundraisers and establish a scholarship fund not just for my son to use, but other children who cannot aford it.  What I\'m looking for from this community is ideas. Anything big, anything small. I don\'t even know HOW to begin a scholarship fund. I imagine that this will be an ongoing fundraising effort to build money in the fund, so I need all the ideas I can get!  Thank you so much for your input.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Here\'s something un-cute:    While grocery shopping with my 2 children (and a cart full of groceries), my asd son with a worried look on his face, grabs my hand, says \"go\", and then points to the front of the store.  So I say yes yes, we\'ll go in a minute, we\'re almost done.  He does this several more times over the next couple minutes until it occurs to me to check his pants.  I check and there\'s POOP all the way up his back. As I pause to ponder our poop predicament, my younger son (who can sense parental fear and confusion from a mile away and has never in his history passed up an opportunity to sieze the moment) grabs my older son by the hair, a struggle ensues, and poop is now on me, the cart, and on both kids.       I finally find an empty cart and begin attempting to transfer #1 (the pooper) trying very carfully to avoid getting more poop on myself.  But my son, who can\'t stand being poopy, starts trying to pull his pants off. At the same moment #2 decides to empty out the entire contents of my purse right there in the grocery store.      We thankfully made it to the car without a complete mental breakdown on my part <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />    The unfortunate thing is that my husband had transfered the diaper bag to his car when he took the kids out the other day, but I amazed myself at my ability to pull a MacGyver with what litte I had:  Some starbucks napkins, sunblock, an empty jumbo pretzel bag, and a shoebox.  Napkins and sunblock to wipe the poo, empty pretzel bag for the dirty clothes, and collapsed shoe box as a car-seat liner in case there was more to come.

That is actually a huge problem for him, I don\'t think he really \"sees\" himself as part of the group, plus he is so used to have a person working one-on-one with him, that he waits for someone to repeat instructions to him personally. He also tends to \"check out \" more in group settings.  We were able to move the aide to a greater distance and often times he needs visual prompts only, but he still doesn\'t have the instincts to follow along with his peers.</div>    This is <em>exactly </em>what we\'re working on right now.

I am struggling with how to deal with this - getting him to follow the insx of other AND be independent in school.  I am concerned that making him dependent on visual cues (i.e., a schedule) is still in a way a prompt, the plus side however being that it\'s the least intrusive prompt - I guess I\'m also just not sure how to fade the visual prompts at some point.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Grace,    You will find a huge variation in onset of speech in ASD kids.  Every ASD child I know has a different path.  My own ASD son, who will be 5 next week, began speaking to us with appropriate functional words just one month ago.  Once he started, it hasn\'t stopped.  It feels like his brain is finally ready to put all of the listening, vocabulary and speaking parts together and no amount of speech therapy before this would budge him.  I feel that his brain had its own timetable and that our interventions helped a bit, but it was really maturity that enabled the parts to work together so that he could start using words functionally.  Just my hunch.    I have heard all of the predictions to the effect of \"If a child is not speaking by age______ , he will not ever.\"  And that, in my book, is complete BS.       What I would advise parents to focus on, while they are patiently waiting for those lovely words to come, is helping your child become comfortable with the foundations of language - - relationships.  A child that is functionally interactive with other people is a child who, when his words do come in, will have a foundation for how to use those words to relate to people.  We found RDI to be very helpful in guiding us in this respect.     Also, I would encourage parents to recognize how very much their child is already communicating.  All ASD kids that I know (and I know quite a few nonverbal kids) communicate.  I believe that showing these kids the respect of tuning into their way of communicating goes a long way toward encouraging them to learn and use\"our\" way, which is verbal language.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Fred, 7, NT  Barney, 5, autism</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Fred, 7, NT  Barney, 5, autism</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Okay, so S. is in love with the teacher\'s aide (class room).  He is totally heartbroken when she sits near other kids and cries if he can\'t be near her.  THis is completely disruptive to the class.  He\'s basically jealous, especially if the little girl he doesn\'t like sits near her.  He completely ignores the teacher and spends all of his time looking at the teacher\'s aide, to the point where he is making her uncomfortable.  We have never had any problem like this with him.  He has never been obsessive about anyting except video games.   He\'s sounds like heartbroken teenager when he talks about her.    Part of the problem is the teacher and the aide thought it was cute until recently, so they encouraged his crush because he would behave for the teacher\'s aide.  I\'ve tried social stories, explaining why his behavior isn\'t okay, telling him is making her uncoformtable, even doing a behavior chart and giving him very clear guidelines.  I\'m not at school with him and the year is almost over.  One full week and two half days.  He\'s so tense and wound up at school he winds up crying all the time.  His cousnselor is useless and his teacher is making him sound like the next crazed stalker.  We are seeing no behaviors like this at home.    I feel like my only choices are to pull him out of school for the rest of the year or go to school with him and just help out in the class room.    Suggestions?  Reassurances?  Ideas?</div>'

LnAmom, we live in NJ (Jersey City) and our insurance is Empire BCBS</div>  The insurance company doesn\'t matter, it\'s what your employer\'s plan says. Two people could be with Empire BCBS and have different benefits because they work for different companies. So the best bet is to call your plan manager and find out if ABA is covered, and if it is, what experience does the provider have to have. Our plan would pay for a consulting session with the <em>psychologist</em>, but wouldn\'t reimburse for the therapy provided by a non-Ph.D. But since the psychologist was something like $175 an hour and the therapist was $10 an hour, that still helped.  JoJo\'s advice about church respite is good too. A church youth group might &quot;adopt&quot; your child and agree to get trained and provide therapy 1:1 as a service project.  When you have volunteers and students, you do need to supervise them yourself until you\'re sure they\'re up to speed with everything. It\'s a lot of work, but saves money in the long run.</div>'

Three trips to the emergency room gave me two different dx, one was \"serum sickness\" (although he\'d had no meds) and another was erythema multiforme minor.     Both times he was given antihistamine and steroid (prednisone, I think). Cold season is starting and I\'m getting nervous because there was discussion that my son may be allergic to a certrain strain of cold virus and I am dreading him being that ill ever again. And to top it off, the steroids were incredibly mood/personality altering; my little guy threw terrible temper tantrums and was agited for three weeks, he missed quite a bit of school and therapy appts due to behavior. It was horrible here, my husband and I didn\'t know what to do and I was in tears every day.    Has your child with autism had anything like I\'ve described?

Also remember that all the DX says is the <strong>currently</strong> he is severe. There is nothing that says he can not get better.    As a matter of fact my son was considered severe at one point. I also did not agree with that DX (I think his teacher at the time skewed what she reported). These days he is considered high functioning. You have started much earlier than me and these days there are so many more treatments out there.

It has gotten better with age, but is always there when she is excited, and just like your boy, when she is anticipating something exciting to her.  Her arms go up and down and she crosses her eye too.  Very funny face.  But when she is doing something that isn\'t exciting (reading, writing, playing) she appears ok.      Yesterday I tried something different at church.  She was in a church play and I gave her a little sea shell to hold in her hand.  I thought if she\'s holding something, she would stim less.  And she didn\'t stim at all!  At one point she was sitting on the floor and rocking a bit to the song.  I held my hand up as a \"stop\" and she did.    So it does get better with age and when they understand (at least in our case).    Try giving him something to hold (a cush ball, anything with texture).  Maybe if they have something to do with their hands, to concentrate on holding, they will do it less.    Dee\'s mom</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Libby,    Sometimes a good strategy (stolen from The Hanen Centreand along the same lines of what BTDT and Jen were saying) is to <em>create</em> a few new \"routines\" using songs, stories, games, etc., that are motivating and pleasurable for your child.  The plan would be to <em>do the activity the <strong>same way </strong>each time </em> (beginning, middle <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">and</span> ending) for the first few times.  Then, when you think your son knows what to expect next in the sequence, you would change it up a bit - by pausing, stopping, playing dumb, inserting the <em>wrong </em>word or action, etc. (which you choose will depend on your child\'s abilities).      The \"Hokey-Pokey\" game might be a good option for pronouns.  Using \"this\" hand in or \"that\" foot instead of \"left\" and \"right\"... You could even use stuffed animals and have Mr. Monkey put \"his\" hand in and out, etc.... and YOUR turn, MY turn, HIS turn, etc... As long as you start with something simple and do it the same way the first several times, you can do any variation you\'d like. The idea would be to gradually make it more challenging or switch it up in new ways.      I would also suggest that you talk to your ST and tell her that it would be helpful for her to give specific ideas and instructions other than simply telling you to \"work on pronouns\"</div>'

The more experience a parent has in the realm of autism, the more they can give valid opinions based on real life experience to what does and does not work.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Ok, I\'m going to try again here. I typed out a really nice reply last night and was about to hit send when when my darn computer just went out. Must be some bad negative vibes lately.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" />     I got a book that really helped up a lot with playdates:  \"Good Friends Are Hard To Find\" by Frankel  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Good-Friends-Are-Hard-Find/dp/096220367X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-5098262-5747817?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1174108423&amp;sr=8-1\">http://www.amazon.com/Good-Friends-Are- ... 423&amp;sr=8-1</a><!-- m -->    It\'s filled with simple common sense information but it really does help with solid advise:  have you and  your child clean the room before the day  have your child call for the playdate (with specific things to say)  put all toys away that are off limits to guests  the guest gets to pick what to do    We never had to think about \'playdates\' growing up either but things are different now and it\'s so important to make friends. Our kids really need them. Bobby is great on a playdate but our problem is finding kids that the parents will allow to come over. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" />  I gave up on if he will ever be asked over to anyone\'s house a long time ago.     Last year we used the book a lot and have more playdates. That book really helped Bobby to understand how to treat a guest and be a good host I guess.         Joey\'s mom:  I\'m very concerned about the boy you described that plays with your son. It\'s not good to have your child subjected to that.     I do understand that your not thinking right now it\'s anything serious and may be it\'s not but I thought it was \'kids\' at first and even punished Bobby at first for things I didn\'t see but believed this boy we had over many, many times for playdates. It wasn\'t until I saw this boy not apologize for saying something really awful and watching my son (very close to his face) cry. Then I saw this boy set up a mess in our family room, come around from the other end of the kitchen and tell me my son did it. Then this same boy faked tripping and faked crying and said my son did it. I know he faked it all because I saw the whole thing and when I told him to get up, the crying imediately stopped (not a tear) and he smircked at me as I told him it\'s not right to lie like that.     This all started with what I thought was innocent but inappropriate behaviors. I didn\'t know this child has some serious issues. To this day this mom has not told me what\'s going on with him (yet I\'ve confided about Bobby and this boy harrassed my son telling others my son has a \'condition\') but he\'s the boy we are now having very serious problems with at school. Just be careful and try to keep your son away from W as much as possible. Find friends that are positive influences because your osn is picking up any and all behaviors from everyone around him.     Anyway, I drank a Starbucks this afternoon and I\'m up all night so I thought I\'d re-type what I lost last night when my computer blew. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /> Man, I\'ve had some bad luck lately.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi,  Thanks a lot for the info! I had not heard of 504 before and will research it.  My husband and I were talking and he says the teacher didn\'t specifically say at the IEP that she would do touchmath. We had the meeting and I have not signed the IEP yet. They took notes during the meeting. I guess they decided to do this b/c last year they handed me one already filled out prior to the meeting and I wouldn\'t sign it.  Anyway, my husband says that she only implied that she would use the program. What she said was, \"Oh yes, my Mother always told me to use TouchMath.\" (Her mom is a teacher)  Erin has come home counting on her fingers again which confuses her and drives me nuts. I even put a number card in her back pack and called the teacher and told her to please let her use it! What is it with schools anyway? Mine just doesn\'t seem to want to hear any input from me on teaching my daughter. I really don\'t think I\'m an overbearing parent but  I know what I know and \"regular math\" doesn\'t work for her.    Cara</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">This just warmed my heart and I wanted to share....    My daughter is going into middle school in the fall and my NT son is going into high school.  To give you a little background, my children don\'t like eachother very much.  I know they don\'t \"hate\" eachother because when one of them is sick, they are worried or if someone is mean to one of them, they stand up for eachother.  But needless to say, they don\'t get along very well.    Anyway, this morning I was getting ready upstairs while my kids were eating breakfast in the kitchen.  I heard my Dee ask her brother all kids of questions about middle school.  She was asking about specials (music, art, etc), she was asking about homeroom and moving around the school to different classes, and he was answering her and she was GETTING IT!    For the first time, they were \"talking\" to eachother.  I thought the things he was telling her were above her head, but she was getting it.  She must really be thinking about her new transition as much as I am.      It made my heart smile.    I think she\'s actually excited about changing schools because her consultant teacher this year is mean, and I keep telling her how everybody is nice in middle school and she\'ll have new teachers and she\'ll love them.    I know she\'s going to \"drown\" in middle school in regular education classes, but we\'re starting out there anyway.      The funny thing is, when she is comfortable with people (my family and close friends), her conversations make a lot more sense.  There is not a lot of scattered conversation.    But when she is really excited to be with other family members (my husband\'s side), her conversation is scattered because she just wants to say so much at once and it gets all jumbled up.    We are always a work in progress <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />    Dee\'s mom</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Look at the NT kids your son\'s age.  Observe what they wear -- dress him the same way. Observe what TV shows they talk about -- have your son watch the same shows.  Get your son involved in the cool activities outside of school -- Karate?  Soccer?  Swimming?  Teach your son to start a conversation by noticing something about the kid. Saying \"cool shirt\" is a good opener.  Too often, ASD kids talk about themselves.  Their peers don\'t want to hear that. Also, I think teaching a young child to approach other kids and shake their hands and say \"Hi, I\'m XYZ,\"  which is what is so often taught by speech teacher is totally the wrong way to go.  NT kids DO NOT APPROACH EACH OTHER THIS WAY.  Spend time at the playground or McD\'s and observe how NT kids your son\'s age approach each other.  They don\'t even say \"wanna play?\"  The just launch into thing.  When my DS was little, Power Rangers were the thing.  A boy would come up to him and say, \"I\'ll be the red Ranger and you be the green Ranger.\"  He wouldn\'t say, \"Let\'s play Power Rangers.\"  The last thing we want to do is teach our kids to speak like someone who\'s learned English as a foreign language.  They have to learn kidspeak or they\'ll be ostracized.  This is especially critical for Asperger\'s kids who tend to speak AT others.  No child wants to be lectured about the inner workings of electrical engines or some such thing. Language pragmatics in speech therapy is critical to helping AS kids converse in an acceptable way.

Bobby took a Wilson readng test and tested out at 12th grade level for decoding and he\'s only in 5th grade but what good is it if he can\'t understand the words he can read!     LMB is a program specifically designed for READING COMPREHENSION. They actually address other areas as wel. You must check this program out. It is very expensive but our school has finally seen the light and trained our resource teachers in it. Although it\'s our first year for our resource teacher, I do believe it is helping TREMENDOUSLY!!! Suddenly bobby is able to talk about the book, he stops and discusses what HE thinks will happen next or asks me what I think. We hired a tutor who never used it before but was willing to try. She worked with him 2 times a week (1 hr each session) and did the LMB all summer long. About halfway into it, we noticed a change in his ability to comprehend. At first I thouht it was just that we wanted to see the change but when school started everyone noticed a lot of changes in him.     I have a neighbor who paid for the 6 week course (about $10,000 mind you) and has tests that prove every time her son went through the course, he made leaps and bounds in all areas of his education. Math and science will become issues of weakness too as reading becomes vital so don\'t leave it to the school.    I don\'t know how you can get the school to look into this program but I found that going to the Principal then Spec Ed director and all the way to Superintendent works well. If you have documentation and tell your story, they will listen and you will get movement in the right direction. Look if they haven\'t addressed the issue or don\'t know how, then tell them what I said at one point, \"NOBODY can say they know autism. We don\'t even know why it exists. We have to keep with the new information because the old from only a couple years ago is out of touch with what can help my child. We must keep changing and learning as a team.\"    Some little things you can start doing are to read books your child has seen a movie to or go through the pictures before reading the words and of course talk with inferences \"I wonder what the bear will do next...\".

Andrea went #2 in her pants and while I am cleaning that My son has it in a stick and is smeering it all over the back porch. some days it is so much. It is like I have to blind monkeys running around my house without direction. If I do not say to get clothes on they will never even be thought of .If I do not tell them it is  time to get ready for school they won\'t even think of it. They have schedules but If I do not tell them to look at them they do not. Alot of the time they are just not there...if you know what I mean. I am sure you all can relate. Like if I fantisized really hard about something great while someone was trying to put on my shoes. I would be jello. I bring them back but they seem to slip away so fast into lala land.  *sigh* My son won\'t eat my cooking. At dinner. I know it sounds stupid but I try to make it good without giving him junk and he just will not eat it. I wish I had a day without struggle.

That\'s one of the things that got me to thinking. I developed more discreet stims like tapping my fingers or feet as opposed to violent rocking or swaying or body contortions, and in doing so I all but lost the old stims -- except for in times of very high anxiety sometimes the more visible ones show up.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ ~Nick    If it wasn\'t for sexual harassment in the workplace....

I know what an evaluation done by SD psychologist looks like and I don\'t think it is enough to understand clearly speech needs or goals.     Also, I think it is totally inappropriate that the SD evaluators were already predicting the maximum amt of services. Don\'t you think she should ask for a private speech evaluation before the meeting - stating that the evaluation does not seem to even be representing the <em>SD\'s</em> recommendations for her daughter\'s needs. Or at least go to the meeting and if they use the evaluation as a basis to deny appropriate services then ask for a private evaluation? As I think the meeting is scheduled for tomorrow. It would appear to me that she is going to need a private evaluation to get an accurate and unbiased picture of her daughter\'s needs which she can then use to argue for the appropriate services?    It just sounds from her description that the SD thinks they will just be able to plow rightover her.    Panickedmomof2,  Sorry, didn\'t mean to address these questions to someone else in your thread.

So he runs in there and stands at the foot of the bed yelling \"Up! Up!\"   Well because he\'s so darn cute and we love him and all, we usually say ok and have some play time on the big bed before we send him off to the monkeys.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />     Well, this particular night we were all on the bed an I was singing songs but in a much softer voice than usual, trying to calm him rather than wind him up.

' <div class=\"postbody\">hi momm3    I can give you a lot of info. but hard to give advice on what you should do...but.. It seems to me that you have a really good family life that would survive this move.  That is a great thing.. you are really lucky.    i don\'t know about the IEP but my guess is you would need a new one.. That happens really quickly here,,, for us it was about 2 weeks past the initial eval. I also think it may work in your favor to \"start over\"..That IEP from Florida with your signature is a legal document signed by you agreeing to that level of services.  This may give the impression that your going to be really happy with say 10 hours ABA a week compared to what you are getting.    As I said earlier, we took 10 hours a week and thought we were winning the lottery, but found out later that all we had to do was ask and we could get more.. a LOT more.    The first step is call SuffolkCounty Early Intervention at 631-853-3100.  They will assign you a coordinator who will come to the house and give you a list of Evaluators and Providers.  My coord. was Pat Hack 853-2339.  As I said earlier, she\'s overwhelmed by cases so she takes forever to get on the phone but is really really generous with services.      From the list of evaluators, you pick one. We used Metro Therapy 631-366-3876 for EI and Marion Solomon Associates 631-567-3400 for Preschool.  Both can be used for EI.  Wasn\'t that impressed with either, but for a freebie eval to get started it was just fine.  Pat Hack told me to steer away from Up Wee Grow, a popular agency, because they dont like to diagnose under 24 months.  Again, there was almost no wait for appt. and if there is one you can just move to the next one on the list.    After the eval was complete, Pat Hack came back to my house with the eval. team also present and we created an IEP.. At this meeting she told me to find an ABA provider (and also speech, didn\'t need OT/PT) from the evaluator/provider list. She recommended Personal Touch Agency, 631-293-0377, and they filled all the hours.. The therapists were wonderful, as was the coordinator, Eileen Butler... very young but smart and motivated. Unfortunately, the standout therapist, Lindsay Pollock, is now with Building Blocks (a center-based program, which i dont think you want right now).  But as an agency I was really impressed. Their people were really well trained... and they focus on EI, not preschool.    Another agency that we use currently for ABA is Bilinguals Inc.. It has a funny name ecause it started out as a bilningual agency,,,but is not anymore.  The coordinator is Laurie Bowman. 631-385-7780.   They have an extraordinary therapist there named Kristin Larkin. She totally lives and breathes these kids,, prepares for hours for her sessions, and often stays late..If you can get her, I would use this agency.., If you can\'t, maybe Personal Touch would be better.      After Zachary had a solid start with home ABA, we moved him to Building Blocks and then DDI/YAP.  DDI/YAP is really superior, so dont\' forget about it when you\'re ready.  One warning.  Don\'t call and ask for a tour unless you are serious about moving to center-based.  If you turn down a spot, you move to the bottom of the list.. one mom said they wouldn\'t even put her on the list again (not sure if thats true).      Also, $3500 sounds like a lot for ABA training. Would consider buying Catherine maurice book, bahavioral intervention for children with autism. it has good list of what to teach to get you started..But there are probably even better sources out there if you research it.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello, I\'m 17 and have Autism/Asperger\'s. I get bullied a lot in School and have my Feelings hurt. It hurts my Feelings because I like Feelings a lot and enjoy talking about and expressing my Feelings. Is that ever a bad thing or is it a great thing? Do more kids need to talk about their Feelings? It seems most Autistic kids are different with their feelings but do other kids need to understand that?         I\'ve had kids bully me and tell me they hope it hurts my Feelings cause I care so much about Feelings.         This all take place in School and they don\'t punish cause they don\'t see it and they say I shouldn\'t be so sensitve to my Feelings.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thank you all for your replies. am based in the uk and i dont think we have a birth to 3 programme. i googled \'early intervation in the uk\' and it comes up with something completely off topic. the speech therapist has been today and my son  opened up really well during the session. i asked her about early intervation and she said to wait untill i see the peadetrician. she has mentioned that we positively include him in all home chores and i have tried cooking today. he  interacted very well and was eager to help but could not verbally express his wishes. he has also cried abit today which for me is good as he will normally just shut us out. i know it is still early days but i believe this diet is begning to change him as he can at least show his emotions. i just hope am doing it right. also am not sure if i will have to stop the diet prior to his appointment as i want the doctor to get a true picture of what my son is becoming. ive made afew home videos of him talking to himself in this language that he formed, spinning things and rocking on his back but am not sure if this is a enough for a pead.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Jules Mom,    Welcome to this forum! Here you find an overwhelming support and answers for most of your questions - not a cure, but to share what has worked for one...etc.    It\'s frustrating to deal with all these. I\'m sure all of us here feel like that most days, or some days.     I\'m not a doctor but the behavior and all the things you explained about your precious little daughter is similar to my son who is 3.5 yrs old and has Autism. All of us here have something common we are dealing with.    Few things i want to ask you, have you tried the biomedication intervention? do you have a DAN! Dr? what have you been trying apart from the special education intervention? does she get aba? Personally i think a dev. pediatrician evaluation is vital. Once my son was diagnosed we were able to speed the process to get services or enrol him in the special ed class. Specialist, or special ed teachers or any therapist can\'t diagnose a child, you have to take her to the dev pediatrician then take it from there.     Just hang in there.    Eden</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">williams dad,  I had the demo to Math-U See and I can\'t recall why I didn\'t go into this program. I checked it out again and it could be because it cost some to get all the lessons as you move up. Math-U See separates each level where On Cloud Nine it\'s all in one.     I like the fact that Math-U See goes through the clock and some shapes and that might be better if you start younger (at their primer level). But the tests seem more interested in spit it out computation and that\'s not the idea in OCN. Lindamood Bell\'s OCN really works at them imaging what\'s going on in their minds and then the imagery of facts.    -For example if you show them an imagery card of 7+2=9, you take away the card (hide it) and ask, \"what was the first number? What was the answer?\" In subtraction (i.g. 7-2=5) you can ask, \"switch around the 2nd number and the answer, what is the problem now?\" That reinforces the imagery and the idea that you can switch the family around.     I wish I knew more about the Math-U-See. Could you tell me more about it? ALthough I\'m good with the OCN, it might be nice to compare the two for everyone else. It sounds like a good program as well but there are a lot of programs out there that are traditional -still focusing more on manipulatives and computation and not the imagery to get it into our kids heads. I dont know if Math-U See is like that or not and I like the fact it has workbooks. Believe it or not, OCN does not currently have a workbook for the child. Their goal is to make the connection of:  concrete to imagery to computation.     I wouldn\'t mind comparing the two!

They gave the home permission to use a cattle prod on the man when he\'d start smashing his face until it bled because that was the only thing that would stop him.  There was a big outcry about how inhume those people were.  Hey, they were trying to stop this man from inflicting himself with a lot more serious damage that a zap on the butt.  At the same time, I don\'t want to have to think of my grandson being gazorched so that he\'ll stop hurting himself as an adult.    It bothers me that this condition is becoming even more prevalent and is almost at an epidemic level.  If 1 out of 150 children are afflicted, to me that could trigger the end of the human race as we know it.  If that number escalates, we\'re done for.      I find it hard to believe that this condition <em>is only now getting attention</em>.  I see the ads everywhere - we need to be aware of autism.  What good does being aware do?  <strong>What we need is a cure.</strong>    Just what are the families of these people supposed to do to make them normal if the doctors and researchers have no answers.  It just isn\'t right.  Its a castrophe to all who\'s lives it contaminates.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Wow, this is a tough one.  I like to think that God never closes a door without opening a window.  We have been through a lot of ups and downs trying to acquire appropriate therapy for my son.  He is now six and a half.  It always seems like we are verging on some sort of disaster and then something happens to make an almost unbearable situation bearable.  My son\'s ABA program was not the best it could be (I say was because we no longer do ABA), but it was made much better by a series of \"unfortunate events\" which seemed pretty much catastrophic at every turn.  Staff would quit (people I never thought I could replace) and I would find better staff.  Consultants would move (the best psychologists ever or so I thought) and I would find better consultants.  Funding was precarious.  We always thought each cheque would be our last.  Disaster after disaster continually resulted in better therapy for my son though.  I had one foot in the psych ward the whole time, but it almost seemed like someone knew just how much I could take and was watching out for us.  Staying home will provide security and familiarity, but I think you should look pretty seriously in the direction of the move.  Just do your homework first.  Make sure these other services are worth relocating for.  Is there anyway you can network with some families in the new area before you finalize things?  Other parents will always be in the best position to provide opinions regarding quality of service.  If I had to do it over again with a newly diagnosed toddler, I think I would relocate to a different town.  Maybe not permanently, but I think I would go for those first critical post diagnosis years anyway.  The ABA services in my area are terrible, my son\'s school is just an average neighbourhood public school and my DAN doc is eight hours away.  We muddle through as best we can.    I wish you a ton of good wishes in making this difficult decision.  Glad to hear that you will be away for less time than you originally thought, but leaving your son for any amount of time is going to be so very hard.    God Bless,  Just a mom</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I have to admit the first few weeks on the diet was so stressful because my son also tested intollerant to eggs, potatoes and peanuts in addition to wheat and dairy. They also told us he was iffy on corn so that didnt leave a whole lot left to feed him (that he would eat) But since alot of things started to change like eye contact, behavior, head banging decreasing some what we kept going. Now about 6 months after being free of those items the change in  his language has been amazing. He use to have 3 words that he used occasionally now he talks so much (of course it is not where he needs to be) He comes to us and says\"momma read book please\" or asks for apple juice(which we dont give him but he thinks it is LOL) He has even told us spontaniously \" I love you\". His teachers at school have even commented on how well he is doing. But here is the dilemma... To a certain extent I am afraid to add anything else because he is doing so well. Sounds crazy doesnt it? We have seen his eczema just about be non existant but we still have some issues because of yeast and bacteria which we are giving Cipro and Nystatin for.

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">So, the worries are there w/ the older kids ... I suppose the worries are more intense w/ Joey -- but there are still worries w/ the older ones. They are certainly different worries. It\'s hard to say which are worse!  </div>      I completely agree with this Joey\'s Mom.  There is A LOT that can go wrong with a child\'s life, any child\'s life.  The autistic cousin of my husband\'s is one of more successful stories from that side of the family.  He has a job working with computers (I know very stereotypical) and a wife, and they are happy together.  They pretty much keep to themselves, kind of like me and my dh most of the time, but they enjoy intimate gatherings and are able to live in the world without outside assistance.  The rest of that family is a nightmare or a nightmare waiting to happen.  Several alcoholics, drug addicts, deadbeat dads- these were the NT kids that were doing all of the NT things at all of the appropriate ages.    Then, there\'s my side of the family.  My brother, a total non-conformist, highly intelligent creative type, very much like my daughter, who did anything and everything to give my parent\'s grief.  He is lucky to be alive today considering all of the very poor choices he made throughout his life.  I have other cousins who essentially became degenerates, contributing nothing to society, hooked on drugs and booze- living fast and dying young.  These were \"normal\" kids with good families.      I\'m not saying that we shouldn\'t be concerned about our autistic children, just to keep in mind that there are a lot of scary, scary things that can happen to our kids, and in the grand scheme of things, I don\'t find Gabriel\'s future to be more potentially frightening than Anna\'s (probably the opposite).  That\'s one of the reasons Anna will never set foot in a public school.  I would sooner send Gabriel because I <em>know</em> he will not cave into peer pressure.  Of course, if he were nonverbal and at the mercy of others, I would be a lot more worried.  As it is, he can take care of himself, and I don\'t know if a lack of dynamic intelligence is supposed to be characteristic of all autistics, but if they made that a criterion on the DSM-V, Gabriel would lose his dx.  So, here again, it just seems to be such an individual issue.  All of our children are different and will require different things to help them to thrive in the world.    BTW, Joey\'s Mom, I wouldn\'t worry about your daughter too much.  I had a total of three dates before I met my husband at the age of 26, and they all happened the month prior.  I wanted to wait until I was in a place in my life where I could commit to a long term relationship.  I never had any interest in the temporary stuff, and I was too busy with school and work before then.  As it turns out, I was married and pregnant a year later, and ready for both responsibilities.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">In my unprofessional, yet somewhat educated opinion (one of my degrees is in Language and had to take a lot of Linguistics courses), I think you should go for it!    1. Just hearing regularly another language will help develop the brain to be able to learn and produce sounds foreign to English later. In other words, if he wants to do more later, you will have helped him by giving him greater exposure and increasing his capacity to learn other languages.  2. Auditory processing should improve.  3. Different muscles are used to make different sounds.  4. English will also make more sense. Other languages have different word orders. This will help him understand the parts of speech better. I like the phrase, \"it gives you something to hang a hat on.\" When you are teaching grammar, you can compare what it is in English and the other language. Especially considering that English uses some verb tenses less often than most languages and many people aren\'t comfortable trying to use them or even understand them. They will be less foggy. When you teach grammar, you will have something with which to compare and contrast.  5. Learning the other language will be natural and easy, at an age that is simple. You will be giving him an ability to learn other languages more easily in the future.  6. Learning another language very young can put it in its own area of the brain. I started learning other languages in high school and although I excelled, they all got dumped into the same spot (or so it was explained to me). I had a lot of trouble with Italian just cropping up in a Spanish conversation. It would happen so naturally that I wouldn\'t realize I had used Italian words until I noticed the confusion on the faces of others.  7. The later you learn another language the more awful you sound. If you\'re going to learn it, you may as well sound good. It would be really neat if your son were to pick up your regional accent in the language you speak. It is awesome when people can differentiate a person\'s accent and it not be an American one!    <strong>Our kid is delayed in some areas, but not impaired and I\'m focusing on 100% recovery. </strong>  AMEN! Our kids do have a chance to be able to do anything they want to. The ones I worry about are the ones whose parents take what the schools and traditional medicine say as gospel. I think our society is failing a lot of children. Praise God for doctors and families that are working hard to find ways out of the maze! A bit mushy, but I am grateful to so many who have gone before us and found things that work. I am also grateful to those who are in the trenches right now, helping us figure it all out! Your son is blessed. His parents are not taking things off the table. Ahh, nothing needs to be said.     The down side, a bit more work now. You can make it fun! I used to read my Italian and Spanish textbooks to my friends\' children. I just had to read in such a way that they wanted to keep listening, even if they didn\'t understand a single word. I learned while entertaining them.    I just don\'t see how you can go wrong. I doubt because you teach him another language at a young age (in spite of any problems he has) that he will be less educated in English in high school. It can affect spelling. I was always a great speller before I spent a year in Italy where the word \"to spell\" isn\'t even used. A small price to pay.</div>'

I was amazed at Raun\'s story and the video footage of the child\'s progress. Raun was lecturing in Manchester the next day and I drove a few hours to get there and meet him. I was knocked out by the concept and booked myself a place on a start-up course in London. I went on the course last year in January and met dozens of parents with children just like my Joe. It took me several months to get my program started, as I had to prepare a playroom for the sessions and enlist volunteers to help out...but I\'ve done it and it is really rewarding.  My second course was last November in Coventry. (The team of teachers are brilliant - they listened to our stories and answered our questions, made us laugh and let us cry.) It\'s the same staff, whether you go to the Institute in Mass. or if they go elsewhere. There are outreaches available, where one of them will come to your home to advise you and work with your child, and there\'s the biggie- the Intensive, where you take your child to them in Mass. and they work one-on-one with him for a week while you watch and learn.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Eden,    I am sorry that you are so upset today.  Each of us on this board knows what that feels like.  We all have our moments and some of those moments last a long time.  We\'re all exhausted from researching, mothering (or fathering) and what I like to call \"therapizing\" our kids.    I too often feel worse after I watch my son being evaluated or after I read the evaluation reports.  They try to get him to do things he just can\'t do and it\'s painful to watch.  Then you read the report and think \"thanks for shoving that info down my throat\".  I think part of the problem is that we know and love our children for who they are and even though we know what their issues are, we think of them as people, as valued members of our families.  When we read the reports, it sounds like they are describing some \"other person\", not our beloved child.  The reports have no empathy, no love, they\'re just clinical, and everything looks worse on paper.  You are the parent, though, and you know the hard-won progress that has been made.  No report can take that away from you.  I basically read the report once, get aggravated, and then file it and don\'t read it again.  If someone needs to see it, fine, but I try not to dwell on it because I know my son and I know he is doing better than he was.    I hope tomorrow is a better day.  Sincerely, Elise</div>'

What exactly are they testing for? And are they usually able to tell you if you have a high or low risk of having a second child with autism? I would imagine that it is hard for them to tell this. I would hate to get false positives or negatives. Anyone have any more info on this? Thanks everyone</div>'

He had not been taken to the potty once or changed at all. Even when poop had leaked. I wrote a letter to the director. She showed it to the teachers.

My son is the same age and is also non verbal.  His social skills and eye contact are getting better but he still will not point, and he will not initiate contact.  He knows his numbers to 10, but no colors, shapes, ect.... He stims quite often and has an occasional mild tantrum.  All in all he has changed so much since this diagnosis a year ago.  But maybe that will give you an idea where your child might fall.  Hope that helps!!!    proudmom of Bryce</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Dear Dad - If you really would feel more comfortable with a second dx then perhaps you should go.  My grandson was diagnosed at only 18 months...and they were correct...he is on the autism spectrum.  Remember, this is a huge spectrum with no two children presenting in the same way.  I would probably look at it as an extra headstart in life if it turns out he is not ASD....must help in many ways for even a \"typical\" child to get all the extra attention.    With early intervention...in milder cases anyway....you can do wonders for your son.  I cried for months with the dx....had to go on meds. and thought of nothing else!  My son &amp; d-i-law went with \"Floortime/PlayTime\" a program started by Dr. Greenspan, as their means of helping my grandson.  He has gone horseback riding, swimming, gymnastics,etc. and has attemded a regular (small Christian school) daycare, pre-school and will now be starting there for kindergarten...only about six so far in his class and the teachers already love him and he loves them.  He will go to public schools for some ST and OT...whatever amount they give <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" /> .  He also was dx\'d with a seizure disorder...gawd....that just about really did me in.  He just occasionally stared in space and even this is controlled by medication.  Never had any grand mal (sp) of any type!    The difference in him between then and now is unbelievable...he chatters up a storm, is friendly with everyone (sometimes still a little hard to understand..but, he started talking late).  I would dare for you to tell he was ASD until you are around him for a while.  I expect this to continue, it just has to.......................    Love,    Grandma C</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">ok - so i think we have a unique situation with our school, but ds goes to a private ABA school, 3 hours/day, 4 days/week.  at this time, this is his only &quot;scheduled&quot; therapy.  at his school, they are using the verbal behavior approach and they have ST, OT, BCBA, as well as behavioral therapists.  they all work together, share data and all work towards the same goals.  every week our home lesson plans touch on speech, behavior, fine and gross motor skills.  we have not found that we need to pay for outside speech therapy.  SO - i think, when ABA is done really well, you should not necessarily need to seek outside speech.  when you look at the ABA that your child receives, do you see all bases being covered?  do you see reasonable progress in all areas?  if not, than you might consider seeking more specific therapies.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">You ask about mumbo jumbo - I think it\'s very real! There are a lot of teachers across the country who are trained to be screeners, so you could likely find a way for your child to be checked for very little cost. Lots of times teachers use it at work and don\'t see it as an income-producing endeavor. I use it along with AIT when I get a chance because it\'s such a good after-care opportunity for parents. As I\'m just learning, since last spring, I do not charge $.    I posted about this last week, with a consumer-beware message about how much the after screening diagnostic part should cost.   If you do a search on Irlen you will likely see it.    There\'s a doctor I\'ve heard about who does a very sloppy assessment and claims it\'s $1000 for more info...really NOT ok!! Quite a disservice to children, families, and to the Irlen work.      If a child has these scotopic sensitivity issues and can read, (or read off numbers and letters from a page) you can hear him/her go from choppy, stressed reading to smooth and flowing reading. I have seen this several times and I\'m very much a beginning screener. Parents (and I) watch and listen and our jaws drop open, it\'s so amazing!    I have a set of lenses myself and I sure wish I had this as a child. It was so hard being in class, rubbing my eyes a lot, and hated the way white paper glared on the desk under flourescent lights. Though I made A\'s, I didn\'t look at school books too much!! I loved to read, but for pleasure, those books had off-white pages, and were less bothersome. Lots of kids read in funny positions and won\'t read under bright light - that\'s one sign of many...    When kids or adults who truly have Irlen issues go through the Irlen tasks in the screening sessions, they get hyper and/or cranky. If they don\'t have issues, they can go on and on with no stress.  I thought I would jump out of my skin - so stressed - it brought me right back to antsy school days in elementary. Irlen is real!!    When you get the color that provides relief, it is often dramatic.     Some Irlen diagnosticians and screeners, I gather, are very good with working with nonverbal children, with those who can\'t say, \"that is blurry\", \"that is better\", etc. Normally, we screeners go by the book and need a child to be responsive and about age 5 or 6 in cognitive and language development.     Personally, I hope to become as talented as others I hear about are - and go beyond the level I\'m at now. Many of my AIT participants are under 6, are non-verbal, or do not answer questions directly.  I\'m eager to be able to serve them better for Irlen.  Other practitioners are said to get a very good feel for the work of Irlen and are able to \"read\" children\'s responses better, and they are creative in getting screening results. I think after I get to know a child after 20 AIT sessions, I am well-positioned to make use of improved Irlen skills as I gain experience. It\'s very exciting and incredibly rewarding!    I\'d recommend your looking into it further. And if you wanted to get trained yourself, it doesn\'t take long...and isn\'t very expensive. Many people on the spectrum struggle with these issues. A lot of people who are ADDish at school, or dyslexic, I believe are not truly ADD or dyslexic....because with the transparencies (and especially the filters/glasses) they no longer display the symptoms associated with those conditions.    If anyone would like more specific info about what a screening looks like, I\'d be glad to explain more. My own training and understanding of Irlen comes from Kirstie Lewis of Seattle.

' <div class=\"postbody\">My mental picture for the word \"recovery\" is a child in a cancer ward. I\'m not a big fan of that word when its used for children on the spectrum.  It IMO creates unrealistic expectations and is a word that is used for people that are ill. I don\'t think of Autism as a \"disease\" or \"illness\". I think that certain characterisitcs that ASD individuals have come and go in phases based on their age and other factors(illness, over stimulation, stress, change in environment and routine) Some children grow out of their behaviors some don\'t, Some behaviors may dissapate over time and be replaced by others. As far as the \"gut\" issue goes, think of that as a food intolerance issue, Do people that have a lactose intolerance ever become lactose tolerant? if you are deathly allergic to certain foods will that ever just go away? No. I think children with Autism have unlimited potential and alot do grow out of their behaviors however I think alot of it has to do with us adapting to our children and understanding them better. The better we understand our children the better we are able to assist them. I think there will always be a little Autism in every child on the spectrum even if they are lumped into the \"recovery\" category.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ mom to Adam 4 PDD, who is no longer non-verbal &amp; Jason 13,ADHD,(&amp; the next Robin Williams)</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ mom to Adam 4 PDD, who is no longer non-verbal  Jason 13,ADHD,( the next Robin Williams)</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Core symptom:  Broadly speaking, tendency  to focus within oneself rather than observing and learning from the environment.   Specifically,  this manifests itself in the following ways (at least for my son):    --Self talking, rather than talking with other human beings.   Spaced out and being in his own world rather than observing his environment and learning from it, the way normally developing kids effortlessly do like fish swimming in water.   I feel that my son is like a fish that cannot swim and has to be taught swimming.      -- Being in his own world also means having difficulty to engage socially with peers and other people.      --Language development is affected because the child is socially disengaged (does not observe others and learn the language).</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Well, IMO the Einstein argument is a tad bit overused.  There was only one Einstein, autistic or not.  And no one else will ever be Einstein.  I do believe, however, that the point is well taken that there is such a thing as an autistic mind that is naturally occurring in nature.  Autistics/Aspies are responsible for many of our greatest innovations and inventions.  There is a valid argument in defending the aspiration to protect this unique way of thinking.      This argument to maintain innovation and creativity is worlds away from what quantumerik is saying, though.  He is talking about helping a child to function and be healthy and think clearly.  He is not talking about changing the direction of his child\'s interests.  I disagree, though, with the argument that \"autism is a misdeveloping brain.\"  I think that it is a very differently developing brain and that our understanding of how it works is in its mere infancy.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Fred, 7, NT  Barney, 5, autism</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Fred, 7, NT  Barney, 5, autism</div>'

But on the flip side, I know of 2 children (my son\'s friends) who would not be able to function without the use of some medications and being able to function in society is so important.

' <div class=\"postbody\">DS didn\'t really have any imagination for a long time. In the last few months, since working with him a lot more aggressively, him going to pre-k, and AJ, he\'s doing a lot more \"typical\" things, like talking on pretend telephones, driving a car down a page as a ramp, and so on. About a week ago, he became afraid of a \"soren\" (his word for dinosaur) in the fireplace in our family room. That morning a week ago, he wouldn\'t even go downstairs by himself, and I really had to work with him to get him to go into the family room. He says \"scary\" and covers his eyes sometimes, and sometimes when he talks about it it\'s with genuine fear in his eyes. I think that he has gone at least  one whole day without mentioning it. Today several times he wouldn\'t go downstairs by himself or into family room. Last night he even mentioned it in the bath tub. I\'ve tried making it into a friendly thing, hasn\'t helped. Couldn\'t convince him that there\'s not one there, either. Has fixation previously has been trains. We don\'t even have very much dinosaur stuff in the house. Really only one toy. An aunt of his gave him a dinosaur toy where you push buttons on a remote and it walks, roars, and moves his head. However, he is not a afraid of that toy, and will play with it. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Any ideas/suggestions?     I have been mostly lurking on this forum. I really hadn\'t even been to it in like a month or so. My son is 3, not \"officially\" diagnosed yet. Though we have been told by his pediatrician (a DAN!), his EI program, the school district evaluators when he turned 3 and \"graduated\" from EI to special ed preschool, and the director of Autism Journeys (AJ)(a center where he receives treatment-ABA, floortime, and SLP) that he has many ASD characteristics but would probably be classifed as high functioning. Sometimes when I come to this forum, I leave feeling more anxious, sometimes grateful, sometimes more hopeful.     Any opinions about \"official\" diagnosis? Our insurance, like many, is less than helpful with this type of stuff. They are not covering any of treatment costs, won\'t cover anything for a diagnosis of ASD or PDD. Finally found a developmental pediatrician that says is contracted with our insurance. DS has an appointment with developmental pediatrician and a pysch eval for early April. Sorry about the length of this post. I\'ve almost posted the question about diagnosis several times in the last 3 months. Thanks.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">For our trial by trial data - Aidan\'s teacher carries her data sheet around with her she marks as she is going maybe every 3/4 trials as we usually only do 3 consecutive from any given program at a time and we usually do about 10-12 programs in a 2 hour session - depending on the program STO  we may run anywhere from 10-15 trials of each STO, we just mix them up. Aidan is little so he\'s not sitting at a table and we think 10 trials in a row of the same thing would be boring for him.  Aidan\'s therapists marking +/- is very rapid and does not at all seem to disrupt the fluidity, in our case, of the session. I participate in each session so it may be helpful too in the regard that I can continue with him as they are writing. But the truth is it takes them seconds to record. As for the level of prompt, in our sheets they right the code for prompt given in the section for each STO, when the prompt level changes they mark it so if he started with a partial physical prompt that would be marked in the section and then if he moves to independent they just mark \"I\" next to the trial where that began. When graphing they will graph percentage of PPP and then graph percentage with \"I\" seperately. They will also right down the progression in his log book.   We are not doing VB so we do not have a formal target list of mands. Instead what we do is always create opportunities during the session where different things he desires are visible. When he requests these things we make notes of it in his log book. We always try and balance items in his items program that are both functional and desireable.   As for labeling versus manding, in our case, once Aidan learns a label he generalizes and requests it when he wants it so this has not really been something I have thought deeply about, though I see how this can clearly be a big problem.  For Aidan, he will not request or use language spontaneously until he is confident and has practiced a word. This probably stems from his apraxic issues. Because of this the contrived language set ups actually work very well for us. I can see that this is not ideal for everyone though.   The HELP  Charts are the Hawaii Early Learning Profile. It is a curriculum-based assessment system. They cover the six primary areas of developement. It is developemental as opposed to the ABLLS in that every skill gives a clear age range. What I like best about it is the layout. It\'s very easy to look at in a glance and see where the skill gaps are based on age and the skills are written out in the graph so you don\'t have to flip back and forth.  We have 2 - one covers birth -3 and one is 3-6. My therapists brought them.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Grandma C-  They are very intertwined, but because many children with autism have sensory issues does not mean they are a sign of autism.  I actually read that in a book by Dr. Greenspan <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />   I used to teach in an elementary school-this was really at the beginning of SID even being discussed in my school district.  There were several children that had sensory issues, and none of them were autistic.    Jack has made huge progress, and still has a way to go in some areas.  He has some social deficits and a very obsessive interest in movies.  Not in a typical 5 year old way-he knows who directors are, which studios produced the movies, the names of bit part actors, etc...He actually wrote a fan letter to Brad Bird-the producer of the Incredibles-I have a feeling that was a first!  He spends free time writing scripts for movie trailers and designing DVD menus <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /> So in his case-the things that make him asperger-ish are the things that are not sensory at all.  He has not gotten the label as of yet because if he does have it, and I believe he does, it is not terribly disruptive to his life, yet.  He has friends, he just tends to not truly get the \"give and take\" of friendship.  These problems will probably get more troublesome as he enters the public school system-he has been in a very small preschool for three years and has been able to control much of his environment there (Montessori)-so the loss of that control may cause him to seem more impaired than he currently does.  The great news for you is that the sensory troubles seem to be concentrated in one area-that makes it a bit easier to work with for your son and dil.  I don\'t mean to imply that it\'s easy-just that they know which area needs the most help.  And remember that lots and lots of people have sensory issues-pretty much everyone, we\'ve just all learned to cope and probably have never even thought twice about it.  Because Evan is getting such great help, it looks like he may only show proprioceptive needs down the road in pretty acceptable ways.  Maybe he\'ll like tight pants <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /> Or he\'ll give lots and lots of tight hugs.    In the meantime-you seem to have found some great support here.  Hang tight and just keep loving him up.    Kristin</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">LittleManzMamma,  We are kind of in the same place right now. Aidan is 25 months. He was evaluated at 22 months through EI and diagnosed with an expressive/receptive speech delay. Presently he receives 2 hours of ST and 1 hour with a special educator per week.     We are getting him evaluated this summer with Dr. Cecilia McCarton. We are waiting until the evaluation to make our decisions regarding ABA until we receive a diagnosis and recommendations. I have heard great things about her and my SLP says that where we are EI tends to hand over the most complete and best services to people who have been evaluted by her because she advocates strongly for the services. Has anyone else had any experiences with her? I have researched night and day floortime(which my ST and educator presently use)ABA, VB, and all the many other educational interventions. I so much want to do the right thing for my son and when we get a diagnosis I want to be prepared to make a decision immediately.    We have had a good experience with ST and our educator. Your son is certainly not too young for ST. I have heard children receiving ST much younger 15-18 months with good success. When Aidan started ST 3 months ago he would not imitate ANY sounds. He had a few words he would say spontaneously dog, light, look, ball but most days he would say nothing. Now he will repeat any word you ask him too. His articulation is  very bad with many sounds, but he is trying hard. He also now has more functional words that he can say spontaneously like open, more, please, juice, move, out, in, hi, see-ya, ball, apple, book, dog, dada. Sometimes he will require a delay to say the word like he will walk to the refrigerator and I just have to stand there looking at him and then he will say open. Or I will say \"tell me\" when he is pointing to the door and he will first say open and then I say \"what\" and he will say door. No mama yet but he does call me baa sometimes.  She also does some oral motor work with him and trys to do some PROMPT but he does not cooperate for that so much yet. She does not think he is autistic but she does suspect apraxia. I think he will probably end up with a PDD-NOS diagnosis.     At any rate I would definately demand some ST now for your son. If he is not too verbal this is the most basic therapy he should be receiving. ST is fun for my son usually. They blow bubbles, whistles, read books, sing songs lots of fun stuff appropriate to his age but she incorporates target sounds, delays to help him use power words and does everything in a very dramatic fashion to keep him interested. I absolutely see how depending on your child\'s level of willingness they may not benefit from ST until they have ABA. But being that each child is different and depending on the skill of the ST, you may find that it works for you. If it doesn\'t you can always cancel but he absolutely qualifies for ST and he is definately not too young.    I too would love to hear from parents who started ABA in the 2\'s. I am a little nervous that my stubborn little man may regress with ABA. Right now he interacts well with people but really responds negatively to being pushed too hard. When his SLP and educator stepped up the gentle sabotage he spent the next 2 sessions bringing them to the door and saying see-ya. And if they asked him questions or commented on what he was doing he would yell AHHHHHHHHH in their face. This was a dramatic turn from his usual attitude toard them. usually he would flirt and have fun. It took 2 more sessions of unpressured play and then he was willing to let them begin interacting with him again. I am very concerned what the pressure for compliance may do to his generally sweet and happy spirit.    LittleManzMama- am I correct in thinking your son has not yet been diagnosed?     Jen</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I think you\'ve gotten good advice already about whether or not to send him to school.    I just wanted to add that my son was severely aggressive from age 2 until right around his 4th birthday.  We were finally to the breaking point and took him to the psychiatrist to get him on medication.      We told the psychiatrist that we didnt\' want to medicate him, but felt we had no choice.  We were unable to take him anywhere where other children would be.  No church, McDonald\'s, park, birthday parties, relatives\' homes, or have children come to our home.  He always hurt someone.  Over and over again.    He hurt his little sister constantly and kicked and hit me many times a day, too.    The psychiatrist suggested we try counseling first.  I was thinking that was going to be a waste of time, but I agreed to try.      We went to a counselor who taught us the Nurtured Heart Approach.  We started seeing less aggression immediately after starting.  Looking back now, I believe we experienced a miracle (we also prayed for him a lot)!  The changes held even when school started!  My stress level plummeted.  Jay can now go to church, sunday school, and all the other places we couldn\'t go before.    There is a website where you can find a certified counselor (we only had to go 3 or 4 times) at <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.difficultchild.com\">www.difficultchild.com</a><!-- w -->, and a book called \"Transforming the Difficult Child\" by Howard Glasser.    If I could do it again, I think I would have kept him home last year (when he was 3), till the aggression was under control.  He ended up getting kicked out of Head start last year for injuring his aide.

' <div class=\"postbody\">The meeting today was really long.  The teachers, the Dean, and the AEA representative (whom I offended!) were there for about 15 minutes before the principal came.  So my husband (have a new respect for daddy now) and I explained the reasons why we felt it was best he go back to first grade.  Gavin is the youngest in his class.  At 2 years old before we started chelating, he tested at a 9 month old level.  So he was at least a year behind.  Chelation was what enabled him to start developing.  But he has the maturity of a kindergarten kid, or first grader at best.  So putting a child like him in a second grade class was a big mistake that, unfortunately, I agreed last year to make.   Gavin is not doing second grade level work.  He is taken out for math, reading and writing.  And since developmentally he is playing as a kindergartener or first grader would, his peers are drifting further and further away.  Last year he had boy and girl friends. This year most boys play with boys and girls play with girls.  In second grade, the silliness that Gavin still has like K and 1st graders, the 2nd graders do not.  These are all big reasons why he needs to be taken back to first grade.  Everyone agreed, as we were discussing it that it would be best for Gavin.  There would be no negatives to it since Gavin makes friends pretty easily in most situations. But then.........     In walks the principal.......  \"We shouldn\'t think of Gavin as being in second grade since he has an IEP.  We should think of him as having his own program.\"  THis is what the principal said.  \"Pulling him out could negatively affect the way he feels about school.\"   Yes it could if he fit into the environment he was in.  But he doesn\'t and he has been getting very frustrated doing his school work, more so than last year.  My hubby (GOD BLESS HIM) started telling all the reasons (in a guy way) that he wanted Gavin to stay behind.  He was saying how Gavin is  feeling the pressure cause he probably knows that he is not doing the same things as the other kids. He doesn\'t play the same games and can\'t do the same work.  This was causing him to not seek out other kids as he had in the past.  He still does at home and when we go to the park, but not at school.  Then hubby said, \"Gavin may always have struggles.   But he has been getting so much better.  He is learning so much more.  He is overcoming so much that putting him in a stressful environment may cause him to pull even further away from school.  It may make him want to learn even less.  ANd we are seeing that right now at home.\"  (YES, THIS CAME OUT OF MY HUSBAND!!!!!  The same one who said the night before, \"You aren\'t going to embarrass me by coming up with a list of reasons, are you?  All we have to do is go in and say that he\'s our son and he\'s going back to first grade cause we think it\'s best. )  Him and the principal spoke to each other in a very \"guy\"  dare I say \"sensible\" way.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" />  The principal (who doesn\'t work with Gavin but sees him each day) said that he didn\'t want us to have unreasonable expectations (like me.....I laughed cause I know he thinks I do) and think that putting him in the first grade was going to \"cure him.\"  I said that I have no illusions that putting him back in 1st grade will cure him.  No...but I sure do think biomedical will... <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" />   They know that.  My husband and I do have different views but we agree on one thing, what\'s best for Gavin. My husband believes that he will always have struggles.  I believe that he will have struggles until we fix him biomedically.  ANd after his biomedical has done what it can, and he still has struggles, I can live with that.  I can accept that.  But I will not stop believing in his recovery nor telling others my goals for him.  I am an optimist....maybe to a fault.  My husband sees what\'s in front of him and not much more.  They thought that was kind of funny that he\'s the \"believe what I see\" and I am the optimist.  They said those two things work really well together for the outcome of Gavin\'s future.  Honestly I think that as soon as Gavin goes to the right level things will really start moving for him.  Putting a 5th grader in a 7th grade class would frustrate any child.  Why would they do it to someone  that has a learning disability?    So Gavin\'s last day of second grade will be either the end of this week, or the end of next week.  We are meeting again to discuss the transition.  Oh and the reason I offended the AEA lady was because she started stating statistics of kids dropping out of school because of being held back.  And I said, \"IF this is an Individualized Educational Program, I don\'t think statistics should be a factor.  Gavin is not any of those kids and their results will not be the same as Gavin\'s.\"  I came off as a -itch, though it was not my intention.  I just don\'t like to be quoted this standard statistical information that has nothing to do with my child.  The principal was not pleased with me either cause I said, \"Gavin will be put back in the first grade, if we have anything to say about it.  We have made our decision.\"  HE said, \"We are a team and you should not discredit the team and what they think.\"  I said, \"I don\'t. I think this team has gotten him this far and can imagine how far they will take him if he\'s in the appropriate environment.\"      So (heart beating a mile a minute) I think it went as well as possible.  Thank heavens for the hubby!!! In my mind, his presence and guy talk with the principal saved the day!!!   Thanks for reading this novel!!!! One more thing in Gavin\'s favor!!!!  I am so excited for him.  I know now he will start to absorb more things cause he is going to be developmentally ready to do it!!! (Fingers crossed!!!)

Remember you are her boss ultimately and in the business world no one would put up with 2 weeks without any work without a plan to really get things back in order for your son\'s program. I fired one consultant for such behavior b/c it was occurring pretty consistently and the girls doing the ABA hours she was supposed to be supervising were really struggling. Good luck and I hope she gets her act together.

It shows an awareness of herself as \"I,\" an awareness that you are \"you,\" it shows what she wants to do (sit), it shows she is aware she needs to request, and to request that TO someone, not just mumble.  She is showing purpose with that question even if it\'s not grammatically correct.  Yay, Anna!    And I even love that she is talking to strangers (NEVER thought I\'d ever say that!)

The laptop seems easiest for her to use, she has tried tracking balls ect..yet the pad on the laptop seems easiest for her.  She does this thing every once and a while with her hand (sliding it back and forth on the keys) and it rips the keys off.

I cannot get her to stop and I do not want to take the computer away for very long beacuse it gives me relief and it is a great learning tool for her.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Just goes to show that if you dont get what you want for your child, you have legal options. This story is from Wrightslaw and should be a reminder to all schools that they HAVE to invoke the IEP appropriately and according to IDEA.    <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.wrightslaw.com/advoc/articles/anatomy_case_jaynes.htm\">http://www.wrightslaw.com/advoc/article ... jaynes.htm</a><!-- m -->    Anatomy of A Special Education Case   What happens in a due process hearing?     Anatomy of a Special Education Case   Background of the Case     Stefan Jaynes was diagnosed with autism soon after his second birthday. Stefan\'s pediatric neurologist advised his parents to get early intervention services through their local school district. But when Brian and Julianna Jaynes went to the school and requested early intervention services for Stefan, they ran into a wall of resistance.      Eventually, the school developed an IEP for Stefan â€“ but they did not involve the parents in the IEP process. After developing this IEP, the school district failed to implement the IEP for several months. During these months, the parents continued to request services for Stefan. These delays had tragic consequences for Stefan.      Although Stefan had autism and needed intensive early intervention services, the school district placed him in a typical preschool program for about 12 hours a week. Because this program was not designed to meet Stefanâ€™s unique needs as a child with autism, the child regressed.      When the parents realized that Stefan was regressing, they withdrew him from the preschool program and began an intensive home-based ABA/Lovaas program. In this home-based ABA program, trained tutors worked one-on-one with Stefan for several hours a day. Later, the parents learned that they had a right to a due process hearing.     Due Process Hearing      After Brian and Julianna retained Pete Wright, they requested a due process hearing to resolve issues about their son\'s special education.     Their due process hearing was held on December 9 and December 10, 1998.     On June 11, 1999, the Hearing Officer issued a decision in favor of Stefan and his parents. He awarded the parents $117,979.78 to reimburse them for the cost of their son\'s ABA program.     The Hearing Officer found that Stefan was damaged by the acts and omissions of the public school staff: \"The mishandling of this case by Newport News Public Schools is inexcusable and tragic.\" Read the Hearing Officerâ€™s decision at:      <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.wrightslaw.com/virginia/jaynes_newportnews_dp.pdf\">http://www.wrightslaw.com/virginia/jayn ... ews_dp.pdf</a><!-- m --> (File size: 682kb)    When you read the Hearing Officer\'s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, you will learn about tuition reimbursement, legal requirements for the continuum of alternative placements, the requirement to involve the child\'s parents in the IEP process, appropriate IEP goals and objectives, â€œloss of educational opportunity,â€ and damages.      Review Officer\'s Decision      The next chapter began when the State Review Officer affirmed the Hearing Officer\'s decision -- but reduced the award of reimbursement by half.      The State Review Officer found it \"obvious\" that school personnel \"predetermined that Stefan be placed in a self-contained classroom and receive the PEEP program.\" He found that the preschool program was \"little more than a nursery school\" and that the school personnel showed \"woeful disregard\" of Stefan\'s needs as a child with autism.      The Review Officer also found that the school\'s IEP was deficient and that the school made no attempt to involve Stefan\'s parents in developing his IEP. Why did the Review Officer reduce the award?

He found that the Newport News IEPs contained many deficiencies and that the district unilaterally â€œeliminated numerous programs from the IEP [and] provided no explanation or justification for striking these programs.â€      He discussed the importance of procedural safeguards. He found that the district failed to notify the parents of their rights including the right to a due process hearing. He discussed the need for â€œmeaningful parental participation in the formulation and implementation of the IEP . . .â€      He ordered the school district to reimburse Stefanâ€™s parents for his educational expenses from July 1, 1995 to the present.

' <div class=\"postbody\">YES this can happen. He\'s holding on all day trying to do his best and then he just lets it out when he gets home. I know a neighbor\'s child that has ADD and does this: comes home and falls apart. My daughter did that up until 4th grade. I remember the teacher telling me at the parent teacher conference that she hates to talk about how she\'s been doing because the first month of school compared to the second is like night and day. Come to think about it, she was teary eyed a number of times THIS YEAR in September so she\'s probably still dealing with the stress but not out and out crying anymore. It\'s a big change getting back into school again for kids NT or not.     Try avoiding TV and video games. Give him a snack right off the bat when he gets home. Get more green veggies. I can\'t say this for sure but Bobby has better days when he\'s been eating more vegetables. Stay away from food dyes and processed foods. You can also set up a reward system. There has to be a way that you can set up a reward system (i.e. for every good day at home he gets so much time on a video game, etc). Use incentives when you can, they work very well usually. Also, have you checked into the possibility of yeast? Behavior issues and yeast seem to go hand in hand. GSE can help with that if he\'s willing to do that.    Is his schedule very busy? may be too much for now? Can you skip some things?     Bobby also had meltdowns. This year is the first we haven\'t seen him have a tough time transitioning. I\'m not sure why but I\'ll take it.     I\'m sure your son will adjust and things will calm down.

Are you all done?\" If he can then apologize for throwing, say all done calmly then we will ask him to clean up and then move on. In that situation, we would probably prioritize developing a more appropriate response to frustration rather then the need to finish a puzzle. Then if puzzles are a constant problem we would probably try to figure out why and if there are any other ways to achieve the same fine motor goal. If we felt puzzles were important we would probably only have him put  1 or 2 pieces in the next time and quit before his complaining reached epic proportions and work up to more each session.     The point being that yes it is important to work towards task completion/ compliance but I don\'t think it has to be all or nothing within 1 session. We have experimented a little with that kind of my way or the highway with a therapist who is actually quite nice and very sweet just a little inflexible and in our case I have found it to be completely ineffective - though every child is different with different thresholds and temperments. For us we have found it to be more effective to entice Aidan into compliance and slowly raise the bar rather then to force it.    As an aside, we have <strong>zero</strong> luck having OT sessions at home. When he goes to his OT gym he is 100% cooperative - at home with OT he is so difficult.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I\'ve had these thoughts quite a few times myself, and my hubby wasn\'t even working.  He\'s a computer game junkie.  Now he is, just barely started a new job.  And I couldn\'t use sex as a threat cause we\'d agreed early on in our marriage not to do that.  What I did do though was bluntly tell him that it was hard for me to get in the mood when I was pissed off at him which was most of the time anymore and that some things needed to change if we were going to make our marriage work.  I also told him that if I\'d wanted to be a single mom I wouldn\'t have bothered getting married in the first place but that was how I felt, like I was a single mom and he wasn\'t there even when he was there.  But I also feel that this is something that would have been a bone of contention in our marriage regardless of how many or what kind of kids we had.  Now I mostly just have to tell him he\'s getting obsessive over gaming and that he needs to have some family time to get him to lay off.  But sometimes I still get pissed off.  I am lucky in that he is interested in the biomedical stuff and actually defended what we were doing to his mother.  She was saying that I should be doing everything I\'m doing with DS and he told her I was which I am believing I have a high mercury burden too.  Our computers are right next to each other so he will watch some of the videos and listen to me read some of the articles and isn\'t upset at spending the money on biomed stuff even though we really don\'t have much.  And sometimes I just tell him to get off the computer I need a break you have the kids.  I go in our room, close the door and read or write, since those are my escapisms.  I know computer games are his.    I\'m white and I once was dating a black guy, it wasn\'t that serious but I was curious so I called my dad and asked him what he would think if I told him I was going to marry someone of a different race.  He shocked me and said he wouldn\'t be happy about it.  I asked why when I\'d been raised to accept people for who they were reagardless of race.  My father is a wise man this is what he told me.   The only differences a marriage can handle are the differences between a man and a woman.  When you add any major difference race, religioun, culture, socioeconimic you are putting more stress on a marriage and decreasing it\'s chance of lasting.   Yes marriage is hard, yes we all have to work at it and it is even worse if only one half is doing the working.  Did you tell him how you feel?  Do you have specific chores you want him to help with?  I know that my husband is a very concrete thinker and he has very specific household chores.  And any more I don\'t just ask him to please do the dishes.  I usually say well honey do you want to do the dishes or take out the trash?  and don\'t even give him an option of not helping.  I know this won\'t work for everyone but it has helped us.  Anyway I am rambling I hope this helps and you have my best wishes that things work out.</div>'

It is WONDERFUL that your son has made so much progress.  And he WILL make a lot more progress.  Too bad there is not yet a cure for autism, but there IS a lot of help.  It takes TONS of work on the part of everyone who deals with an ASD child.  Better give the grandparents the bottom line -- there IS no cure. Just lots of helpful treatments that will bring their grandson as far as he is able to go. Which may be pretty far.  (((HUGS)))</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Today was just strange, and I guess I need some advice from some ABA veterans.    We had our new consultant come out and my son was just either in a mood, or not used to her style. He was not compliant at all, goofed off a lot, etc. Now, he is totally used to sitting at a table and doing ABA, and she was working with him on the floor, with the expectation that he would sit \"indian style\" and do the trials. But, he\'s having a problem with this - he\'s not used to it and she\'s having to really work on getting  him to sit for her and work. She IS a new person to him, and he was obviously testing her. She was great, though, and just dealt with it.  I\'m really glad she has identified this weakness in him, because he\'ll need those skills at school.      However, it was hard for him, with the new demands and yet another new person.  By the end of the session, he was trying to hold back his tears. I recognized it and went to pick him up. My home therapist, then, started to grab him and tell me he was \"just playing me\" and she was going to just ignore him and plow through.     At that point I just said, No, and picked him up and comforted him. He burst out in tears and just sort of had a little melt down, but nothing totally off the wall - he had just had a tough morning in therapy and was upset. I let him off the hook and let him watch TV for a few minutes and he was fine.     I guess I\'m wondering if this home therapist really knows what she\'s doing. More and more she\'s describing him in school as willful, and defiant - she is assigning motives to him that I just don\'t believe are there. He\'s only 4 1/2 and yes, he\'s smart, and probably wants his way, but I don\'t believe he\'s manipulative. He\'s autistic. He has communication problems.     Anyway, she does this other thing at school when the day is over. If he hasn\'t been \"good\" or he did something wrong, she won\'t let him run around on the playground with the other kids. She actually holds him back if he hasn\'t been compliant. I don\'t feel this is at all what we want from her. I want my son to run and be a part of the group - he has enough trouble with kids to be purposely held out apart from everyone.     I feel she\'s trying more to be a parent to him than a therapist. She\'s crossing lines. We have recently been paying her to take him to school and shadow him there, and then take him home. She is also correcting other people\'s children while she\'s there. I don\'t know, maybe she\'s just a nut.    I don\'t want to fire her yet, but I do want to discuss this with her. I feel I\'ve hired a person that is actually over qualified for the job. She has a big psych background, but no ABA background. I feel she wants to have her own agenda with him. She\'s doing speech exercises with him, which is fine, yet I didn\'t really ASK her to do that with him. She just takes it upon herself to do it.     I dont\' know, can anyone provide some input - what is the proper amount of discipline and control you should expect from a home therapist? Should they \"discipline\" your child at all? She seems to believe that he understands consequences - and to some extent, I feel he does. So, to say to him, you won\'t get this if you do this, is ok - but honestly, could he really be at that point of comprehension?</div>'

I may need time to accept, then hurt over, the loss of the \"normal\" child I thought I would have.  Be Patient with Me - Remember that I have as many as 4 to 20 professionals telling me what I need to do to help my child. It\'s often overwhelming.  Respect Me - You are the expert in therapy, medicine, or education. I am the expert on my child.  Listen to Me - I spend hours thinking about ways to make life better for my child. I generally know if something won\'t work at all. I have a lot of good ideas. I read a lot, too.  Encourage Me - Take the time to tell me what I\'m doing right. I never feel like I\'m doing enough. Point out even the smallest progress you see, because sometimes small progress is all there is to keep me trying.   Understand Me - Understand that as hard as things get sometimes, I would not trade this precious person and all he adds to my life and family for a normal child. He is special, as all children are special, and I know that, even when I\'m struggling.  Remember Me - If I burn out, I can\'t change my job. No one else will step in and take over for me. I am in this for the long haul, so I need to pace myself.  Thank You - Thank you for choosing to be a part of my child\'s life. Thank you for your patience and dedication.

Is the school your children attend using VB therapy or is it a home based program?  If you are doing VB therapy at home is your school district helping you with the cost?  I live in NJ and would love to know how to find a good VB therapist.  Any suggestions please?  Thank you, Carmen</div>  We got started with VB/ABA because we didn\'t see much with the therapy we were getting at the time.  I heard about ABA therapy and I wanted to try it.  We were getting the play therapy through EI ( Early Intervention, the 0-3 program most states have) so they paid for the VB/ABA.  It was a home program.   Within the first week, we saw a difference so we opted to continue with it even past the age of 3.   Now, the school district does a partial VB/ABA program at school, and I pay privately for the rest.  We\'ve never done the full 40 hours that people recommend.  I would say we\'ve done 30-35 hours if you include the time I work with my child as well.   There is a Verbal Behavior Yahoo Group if you need more information. <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/VerbalBehavior/\">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/VerbalBehavior/</a><!-- m -->  It\'s an excellent resource.  Both parents and VB/ABA professionals post there and it\'s moderated well.  There are parents on that group who do VB/ABA on their own with a consultant designing the program.  These parents go to regular conferences/seminars to update their skills.   If you\'re looking for a therapist, please find a BCaBA or BCBA who knows VB/ABA.  If someone has that BCaBA/BCBA qualification, they\'ve had to pass a test demonstrating their knowledge of ABA.  Make sure the person has worked with at least 15-20 children on the spectrum.

My oldest is 15 and high functioning and youngest 13 and profound, non verbal.   I don\'t have any good news on teen years from our experience, isolation and rejection for HFA son and my other boy is now more obviously different from normal children of the same age and educated with other children like himself, I use the word &quot;educated&quot; very loosely, same old child minding it always was, expectations are as low as ever only now the cat is well and trully out of the bag. None of this comes as any surprise because I have been peeking in at the teen kids since my boys were little. We haven\'t noticed any kind of hormonal problems, if anything both boys have made improvements mostly the higher functioning 15yr old, but then he has far less ground to make up being fully verbal, no stimming or such like, he did develop OCD and severe anxiety at 13 but this was decided by psyche\'s to be down to the very bad school placements he had to endure, bullying and rejection, most of us would develop an anxiety problem if we had to endure that every day! I can say that every single improvement my children have made has been through my own efforts both biomedical and now with 20 hours VB for youngest, biomedical and lots of support and educational help for oldest, left to the authorities oldest would be a complete nervous wreck and youngest would still be banging his head off the hardest surface he could find.

' <div class=\"postbody\">D\'s first visits, from what I understand, were only the most basic of exams (probably combined with lots and lots of bribery), which quickly made it evident work was necessary.  He then had an appointment where he was put under general anesthetic, had x-rays, fillings, teeth pulled, teeth capped, etc.  This was when he was three.    When he came to us at 6 1/2, his whole mouth was full of rotten teeth since nobody had ever brushed them <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /> .  We had another exam.  This one with a couple of x-rays while he was awake - he was okay with that, because it was explained, and all he had to do was bite on the little plastic thingy.  We were referred to the pediatric dentist who does all the adults and children with special needs in our area.  He \"re-examined\" D, focussing this time on compliance.  Gave D a gameboy, was upbeat, had him open up, and get his teeth counted with the \"counter\" (the little metal hook thing).  When D was nervous initially, the dentist let D use the hook to count the teeth on a dummy, and praised him for being such a good counter.  He also made sure D had a handheld mirror, so he could watch the dentist in his mouth, and thus feel less nervous.  He then had an appointment for general anesthetic to do the work.    After that bunch of work, the white filling they\'d put on an eye tooth fell off <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" />  I went back in, and they said \"no problem, we\'ll fix it now, with him awake\".  D was not compliant, they put him in the restraint bag, and had two people plus me restrain him, got it on there, but not a very good job.  We let D up, he ripped the filling off.     We made an appointment for \"conscious sedation\".    D had the tooth pulled.    Now we\'re working on increasing compliance for check up, cleaning, and scaling, so that by the time he hits his teens, when scaling is more necessary, he\'ll be fine with it.  He does pretty good now.  He lets the doctor examine his mouth, is fine for the brushing, still a bit nervous for the scaling (which we call rubbing, and he had done on a dummy in front of him first, then on his finger nails, with lots of fun giggles from the hygienist), but tolerates a bit.  He\'s very motivated by the fact that he\'s been on the \"cavity free\" wall for over a year and a half!!!

Or assume that sensory breaks would encourage non-compliance.  I need dgdavis\'s \"dog pile smiley\" here!    I was talking with our home therapist yesterday about this and she said, \"Remember when I had to bounce (on a therapy ball) or swing Alex in between and during every activity?  Now I hardly have to do that.\"    Sensory games (not goals!) are often <em>essential </em> so that the child can organize his senses and be mentally available for the academic activity.   Children whose sensory systems are understood, respected, and worked <em>with </em>learn much better.  And most kids who have proper sensory care become much more organized as they mature. The body learns, little by little, how to organize its sensory input through OT and sensory integration games.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Fred, 7, NT  Barney, 5, autism</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Fred, 7, NT  Barney, 5, autism</div>'

How patehetic is that. To think that the our gov interest is more on the  toxic we live with &amp; breath each day, And Yet it did not matter to them that  our  children , who are the future generation lf this country was being poison by the same gov. That is absurd. I hope they are exposed  for  the pain &amp;  mental suffering  they  have cause us parents &amp;  our kids. &amp; that more parents can win their case courts if they have the evidence &amp; proof  that their children have actually been poison by  the  chemicals &amp; thermal toxic injections.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello ccgrace, welcome to the forums. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /> It\'s a lot to digest at first. Remember that your child is the same person they were last week, last month, last year...there\'s time for you to figure things out. I know that at first there\'s an overwhelming sense of urgency to &quot;do something!!&quot; but starting too much at once is not only exhausting, it makes it difficult to tell what is actually working with your child.  1. Balancing time for research - allow yourself a set amount and stick to it. If you try to digest biomed and therapy, etc in one day you\'ll drive yourself nuts. Even the most experienced in each area will tell you there\'s tons they don\'t know. Break it down into areas you need and then concentrate on those areas. If speech is a concern, make a list of what you would like to see him doing and then post looking for help on things to try. Same with feeding issues, haircuts, sensory, etc. Our kids are a work in progress. Take the main areas first and work on them before moving/including others. Too much at once is overwhelming for both you and your child. If you have concerns about digestive issues/potty problems (and it sounds like you do), post about those as well. Those from different areas will be happy to provide info on what has worked with them. PLEASE, please do your own research before giving vitamins/supplements to your kids. (This is not an anti-biomed statement by the way). Sometimes too many things at once prevent you from noticing what works. As well, your child could react to these items (due to allergies or whatever) and you need to be on top of it. When in doubt, ask your pediatrician. Mine has always been open to anything I wanted to try and was able to look at it from a medical viewpoint (which gave me peace of mind).  2. Binders and the knowledge that you can say no. If you are overwhelmed, tell some of the ones wanting data to give you a few weeks. I\'d work on poop details first since upset tummies can affect behavior greatly. (Just my opinion of course). Get a binder (like was already suggested) and make charts. I\'ve kept many different diaries on my kids and it is difficult.   3. My daughter is my oldest child and actually the other kids make things easier. They should be involved with your disabled child and helping. Don\'t discount the power of kids playing! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /> It seems that kids will imitate what other kids do before they follow after the big people around them. If you have specific areas that need work ask your other kids to help and get involved. I do make time for my other kids individually and when the subject comes up, we talk openly and honestly about our child with a disability. (I had to explain the word \'retarded\' to my middle child the other day - she didn\'t know what it meant but heard kids at school using it).   All the best...</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ &quot;... but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.&quot;</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ ... but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">First off -<strong>welcome Droopy</strong>!  This site was my lifesaver during E\'s dx and beginning of this journey.     CJ   -  I am afraid you may be a victim of \"the game that mamas often play\".  My son is now going through a divorce from an evil woman (not Evan\'s parents...thank goodness)!  Although it is 2009, the courts seem to still be under the idea that the mother is always the better parent...not so!  My son has been forced to live with us because of court decisions.  Thus, his two children live here 40% of the time.  This is not a bad thing..we love all of them...it is just not a fair thing.  Her 19 year old male (former college student of hers)  \"babysitter\" lives in my son\'s house...etc.  Enough of my story!    We try very hard to point out to the kids  both NT (boy almost 7 &amp; girl almost 3) that they have two homes.  One is wherever daddy is and the other is with mommy.  It is so important to make them know they are at home with daddy too and not just visitors.  \"Mother\" has made all the visitation rules thus far, fortunately they are w/dad 40% of time as I said.  One week they don\'t get to see him for a whole week and that is too much in our experience.  My GS takes a day to adjust again.  My granddaughter needs no adjustment she just says \"my daddy, my daddy\" and cries when she has to go back.  I really opt for a visiting plan (if possible) to have a lesser time than a week away from a parent.  I would guess that might be more important for a child on the spectrum.  It seems they would (more than usual) develop too much of an attachment to the parent with the most time.  That is not fair to the child or the other loving parent (usually fathers)! DIVORCE usually \"sucks\" for the kids!    <strong>Sasha\'s Mom</strong> - A gentle reminder - they are \"our\" children not \"my\" children <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /> .

' <div class=\"postbody\">Well, if it makes you feel any better, <em>I</em> don\'t have what it takes to run an ABA program.  I think I would go insane within a matter of hours.  I just can\'t handle that much structure.  I was actually thinking that you have much better ideas than the people involved in your son\'s program and you would know better than anyone which things were really important for your son to learn and which could wait until later.  For instance, I haven\'t even really tried to teach money concepts to Anna, and she\'s five and a half.  With Gabriel, that kind of stuff doesn\'t even make it onto the radar screen.  If he didn\'t have the academic skills that he has because of his own natural talents and interests, I wouldn\'t be trying to teach those either.      Speaking of talents, does your ABA team ever incorporate your son\'s interests into their program? I have found that I can teach a ton of concepts while sitting down and drawing with Gabriel.  We worked on big and little during one of these sessions, and it was the first time that he ever showed any real comprehension of these concepts.  A week later, he started using \"big\" and \"little\" spontaneously to refer to different things.  He had generalized without any effort on my part.  The thing is that it was not the first time I had tried to teach him big and little, but I really think the reason it worked this time is because the activity that he was involved in was so naturally reinforcing.  I actually came across something in a book that discusses ABA/DTT at length that says that once a child has reached a certain level where they are attentive and receptive to learning, the program needs to become driven far more by the child\'s own interests.  It makes intuitive sense to me, as I have never met a child who does not respond more favorably to having a chance to do something that they enjoy than to being forced into doing something that they have no interest in.      So, if I were trying to teach your son money concepts, for example, the very first thing I would want to know is what does he love?  What does he prefer to do when no one is directing his activities?  Then, I would use these interests as a framework for teaching him about money.  I don\'t mean in the same sense as ABA might use an interest or a favorite object as a reinforcer for completing a different task.  I mean find a way to teach the child the skill(s) <em>while </em>he is engaged in a favorite activity or while he is using a favorite object.  Yes, this takes more creativity, but I have found it actually requires less effort in terms of getting the child to cooperate.  You have set up a scenario where there need be no other reinforcement.  You don\'t have to continue to up the ante or worry about compliance.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">MCA,      I hear exactly what you\'re saying.  I in no way want to imply that my three year old is able to understand the concept of everything that goes on in the mass because he doesn\'t.  But neither does my 8 year old.  Gosh, I still struggle sometimes!! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />  Building a relationship with God IS very abstract and is a lifelong process.  I think he understands about as well as my NT did at that age (which frankly wasn\'t a whole lot either!).  And I think if he were more severe I wouldn\'t expect him to sit through a mass.  At this point I just want him to understand the process of sitting, singing, saying \"peace\" (which he just loves!), going up to see Father, etc.  And then we\'ll build on it, just as we have with our other child.    In our situation, we have a little boy with mild autism.  He is able to sit through the services as well as, if not better than many of the NT I see in mass.  It took us two years of \"practicing\" back in the cry room to get him where he is now.  Going to church is not an aversive to him at all--if it were, he would probably be staying home with me or Dad!  I expect that as time goes by, he, like my other child will better understand the whole process and build his own relationship with God.  I just don\'t see a reason to wait to start that process.  Maybe that comes from not having been raised with the support of a religious community--I don\'t want that for my kids.      I hope that makes sense (?)

' <div class=\"postbody\">Dear Jakesmom,    Please know that there are children of all ages who make huge gains and still have their potential just waiting to pop out. I met a man recently whose son started an intensive sonrise program at age 9 and by 19 was fully recovered.    Much of what appears as \"autism\" is learned behavior, i.e. the behaviors get embedded deeper and deeper and the longer they happen, the harder they are to shake.    of course there is neurological damage that if not corrected may have lifelong effects, but your child is still a child and we are beings that learn our whole lives, we dont shut down at age 18.    the reason i am saying all of this to you is not to be smug about anything, and not even to give you hope, its just that this is a fact - no human stops learning and yes, old dogs can learn tricks, so to speak.      I empathise with you completely. Even though my boy is only 5 years old, younger than your son, he cannot write, has limited speech, lots of hyperactive behaviors that prevent him from going to school (not that i would send him there anyway) - the list goes on.    even for him, at the tender age of 5, there is very little help and/or knowledge.    I home school to the best of my ability, with love and acceptance and nurturing but the progress is slow. It would be much slower at school though.       You are right in that all parents must educate themselves and NEVER EVER trust anyone with their children\'s education. Its not difficult to learn special techniques to get your child to enjoy using a pen, to write etc.    You as the parents will know infinitely more how to do this, than a teacher or aide or even speech and languge therapist or OT because you know your child better than these people ever could.       I have to say, that your story is pretty reflective of ours, in terms of any help offered, and probably mirrors a large proportion of those who are on this list.    we dont get any services now because we dont want them. they have ALL been pretty useless and some have been quite damaging (SLT)    I didnt write here to provide answers, i wish I had some for you, I just wanted to say that there is no such thing as false hope and your child has the rest of his life ahead of him.    dysgraphia, dyscalculia, etc can be worked on by you, problem is that now your boy is older, probably knows his own mind better and may be less willing to work with you, less so, than say when he was 3 or 4?    I know you can find a way to help him in these things. I know you can find ways to help his eye contact and language.     My auntie who is 75 just got her first laptop. She never touched a computer in her life and now she is whizzing through the net.     do you see what i am getting at? Its never too late to learn and these problems CAN be overcome.    what can also be overcome is your belief that it is \"too late\", that damage has been done, etc.     your child needs you now, more than EVER. If you believe he is this way or that way, then your actions will reflect that.    If you believe that he has the power and ability to overcome his challenges then that is all he needs, cause he needs YOU.    why do you believe what you believe about your son, now that the system has screwed him? i dont want the answer, its not for me to hear.     Can i suggest or ask you though, to examine your beliefs ? where they come from? Your boy is still young.     take him back . Give him the gift of believing in him, its the greatest gift you could ever give him. Never mind what \"they\" have or have not done. Its about what YOU are going to do for him, with him. NOW.    Get info on dysgraphia, get him a special writing table/desk. Get some help, get him motivated. What motivates him? Does he have a favorite movie/singing personality? Get him to write a letter to them and tell him that if he writes a letter to them, they WILL write back.    tell him he can write on the walls if he wants to, if its going to get him writing.     get mirrors in his bedroom, in the kitchen, in the hallway and get that eye contact going. practice in front of the mirror  - make sure everyone who comes in contact with him is working with him on eye contact.       this little boy needs you now so much, probably more than when he was much younger. dont give up, dont feel depressed - there is work to do, much work to do.    our kids are never too old. I truly believe that.    the only problem with getting \"older\" is that, as i said before, the learned behaviors get embedded and more difficult to break old habits.    thats all they are - learned behaviors. we can unlearn them and new ones that will be beneficial.      keep strong - nothing is finished, it hasnt even begun</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">We did have this problem until I learned about the Precision Command Format: Tell once (it\'s time to pick up the books), ask once with please, (D---- pick up the books please) command once with need (D----- you need to pick up the books) then physically move them to do the desired behavior (this is picking up books, this is picking up books).  Saves on yelling and screaming and with my two not only do they know that if they don\'t do it when I tell, ask, or command that then mommy will be doing it hand over hand with them, but they have also stopped scooping them off of the shelf to make a huge mess because they now know that they will be picking them up.  Even if they are crying when I pick them up and with my hand over theirs they pick them up and put them on the shelf, I still did it anyway and now it is not so big a deal. I don\'t usually have to get to the physical modeling any more.       Also there is tons of praise for doing it even if I\'m doing it hand over hand with them.    We do still have this problem with my oldest and youngest NT daughters, I feel that my husband expects more of them and he thinks I give them too much leeway.  I find a middle ground is best.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Instead of speech we should be focusing on communication. I think being able to communicate, both expressively and receptively, is very important to an individual\'s functioning level. Another thing that I have noticed related to functioning level in children is rate of progress. Slow progress usually correlates with lower functioning.     However, I also agree that trying to place children and adults in categories such as high and low functioning doesn\'t have much meaning.</div>'

If your son needs his own aide, the school system is obligated to provide one, you will have to show that he needs one however, this is where an advocate could be helpful.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Are the specific programs written out? For each of Caitlin\'s programs there is a sheet in her binder that tells how to run each program with what the SD is and what the desired response is. I think the program goals need to be specific and measureable even if they do occur in a natural environment as opposed to being at the table. To me that is necessary in order to obtain objecitve data that can be tracked to see if your child is making progress or not. Also the data will tell if the programs need to be tweaked to allow him to be successful. Our home program team (and I as well) has the philosophy that if a child is not progressing that it is the fault of the teaching method and not the fault of the student and that the teaching method constantly has to be adjusted to allow the child to be successful at achieving goals.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Laura Mom to: Caitlin age 8 ASD Maegan age 11 NT</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Laura Mom to: Caitlin age 8 ASD Maegan age 11 NT</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Anne_B,    I completely agree with you. I use to think that my husband didn\'t help out more because he was in denial, but now adays I just think it is the way he is. My sister\'s husband is just as bad if not worse. She has 4 NT children.  She has been trying to get him to help out with the kids and house with very little success. It\'s even hard for her and me to go hang out together because he doesn\'t want to<strong> babysit</strong> (as he puts it) the kids. When he finds out she wants to go out he will think of a million excuses of things he has to do, to get out of it. I keep hoping that the next generation of men will not look at child rearing as beneath them. (Though I do know that there are a lot of good dads out there, but as of yet I have come across more bad than good.)</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ <span style=\"color: #BF0040\"><strong>Knowledge Without Experience Is Just Information ~ Mark Twain</strong></span></span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Knowledge Without Experience Is Just Information ~ Mark Twain</div>'

One little book comes that comes to mind as one  that seemed to get my son motivated to imitate sounds was \"What does baby say\" by Karen Katz. It is a flap book and it uses beginning sounds (goo goo, mama etc). I would lift the flap very dramatically and then say the sound. He enjoyed it so much and eventually if I would delay lifting the flap he started imitating the sounds.  I will try and locate more resources for you.    Just wanted to add - aside from books, songs and dvd\'s the toys Aidan has serve more as a motivator to learn language as opposed to increasing his recepetive/expressive language from the toys themselves. For example, rather than finding a toy that proclaims to teach language, for Aidan what has worked better is to find a toy he LOVES and then use it to elicit language.  So he loves his marbel run. We may hold the marbles and he needs to request them - give me, more marbels etc. If your daughter can\'t use words any approximation would be acceptable or if she\'s not pointing or gesturing you could start there with hand over hand. The trick would be that it would be something that is motivating to her. There are many toys out there that \"teach\" language, but in my experience the toys that taught the most were just the toys or objects my son liked the most. And I will tell you some very strange things have taught him a lot - you never do know what my son will find interesting on any given week <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />      Jen</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Kayley, 5(NT)  Aidan, 3 (PDD-NOS)</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Kayley, 5(NT)  Aidan, 3 (PDD-NOS)</div>'

I was never able to confirm this, but as near as I can tell, the last time Missouri school administrators heard a presentation on autism was ten years ago. The point of that program? To help them avoid lawsuits filed by parents who are angry about their autistic childrenâ€™s education.      Back in 1998, the Missouri Association of School Administrators (MASA) annual law seminar included a section titled â€œSpecial Education for Early Childhood Autistic Students -- How to Avoid Parent Demands for LOVAAS/TEACH Methodologies.â€ (In this case â€œTEACHâ€ is a typo; itâ€™s supposed to be TEACHH, an acronym for Treatment and Education of Autistic and Communication Handicapped Children.) That program and LOVAAS (named for the doctor who invented it) are now considered among the best methods for teaching young autistic students. The notes on the pictured copy of the law seminarâ€™s program were written by Kansas City attorney Kim Westhusing, who has represented several parents of autistic children in due process cases against metro school districts.    After a page and a half of running down what LOVAAS and TEACHCH are â€“ and noting that students in early childhood special education programs can have their services 100 percent reimbursed by state funds instead of individual school districts â€“ the document goes into detail about increases in litigation over special education, test cases in which parents won, and how a district can deny education services while avoiding litigation.     Even though this seminar program is ten years old, it is the last time MASA chose to address the issue of special education for autistic students, according to Stephanie Sappenfield, an administrative assistant with the group. She told me there had been no other programs on autism education in the past decade.    <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://blogs.pitch.com/plog/2008/07/how_to_avoid_special-ed_lawsui.php\">http://blogs.pitch.com/plog/2008/07/how ... lawsui.php</a><!-- m -->        [/img]</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to 15 year old with Early Infantile Autism, Inattentive ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Anxiety Disorder</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to 15 year old with Early Infantile Autism, Inattentive ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Anxiety Disorder</div>'

It helps him decompress and relax after school at least the nintendo 64 games did the wii games I\'m not so sure about because he does get more upset when playing them so I\'m going to buy his favorite nintendo 64 games to play on the wii and see if that helps.  He needs that time because his classwork and the programs they run with him at school are really intense.    However I do use them as motivators for our son, lately he has been very resistant at school to doing his work and has had more temper tantrums and outbursts.  While the basis for some of this behavior is diet related and we are getting that figured out some of it is simply that he doesn\'t want to do the work.  So if I get a note and homework sent home he doesn\'t get to play the wii that day.  If he does well at school he gets some game time that day.  There are so few things that motivate our kids, I found that this was a really effective one.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Actually a good and ethical consultant will tell you there is a time line for ABA. ABA ends when the child no longer needs tasks broken down.    It can actually be a hindrance, a huge hindrance, in my opinion to retain ABA past its sell by date.     Motivation come from within and children learn in a natural environment.    If you as your child\'s parent remain in ABA \"mode\", you may be projecting onto your child the confines of the \"program\".  I met a mom recently who has used ABA now for 7 years. Her child is almost 12 and she still says to him \"pick up\" when he drops something on the floor. Its a retained reflect almost, at least with her anyway. I watched her watch him and he was actually going to pick up the item and put it on the table on his own volition.     This is just an example.     If you imagine, going to the park to let your child play, as opposed to \"playing\" in the house via the ABA program. A child who is climbing ladders, and playing on swingsets on his own, as opposed to watching you do it, and being \"led\" by you, is going to have different experiences, use his muscles differently and his brain differently at the park than in the therapy room.     I make no bones about my current dislike of ABA but even the consultants that i had to fire, told me that there is a time when ABA should end.     You will find this echoed in the BCBA ethics section.     Teaching a child never ends, however. I think after a while with ABA its pretty easy to get the lines smudged in terms of naturally teaching ones child and abiding by the tenets of behaviourism. ABA is a definite \"approach\" and for us it was hard to let it go. Now for us, our child leads. No pressure is on him and he is learning easier and quicker than he ever did in our ABA program.     That\'s our experience only mind you. Every child will need something different.     Its really a decision you must make based on your own philosophy about teaching and education and of course whether or not the child is progressing, is happy or unhappy.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Dana -     I work full time and always have.  Would I prefer to stay home or to work part-time?  Definitely.  But this is just not an option for me.  I have three children and it\'s my middle one that has autism.  We just both need to work to make ends meet, end of story.  Life is expensive these days.    That being said, it is SO hard to balance everything without feeling like I\'m not doing anything as good as I should be.  I work just enough hours to maintain full time status (35 hours a week here) and two of those days I am able to work at home.  This allows me to be home two mornings a week to get my children out the door to school - the other mornings my hubby does it.  The days I work at home I start at 5:30am, work for 2 hours, then take a break to get my kids ready for school, then start back up at 9.  I must admit it is a very flexible job and that really helps.  I am home every day by 3:30 to get my kids off the bus.    However, it is still so difficult to find time for doctor\'s appts, IEP meetings, etc etc plus every free minute is spent just trying to catch up.  There is always something to do - right now we are trying to get paperwork together to see Dr. Krigsman and it\'s been taking me three months to do it and still not done!  Let\'s not even discuss housework <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";-)\" title=\"Wink\" />      Sorry for the long post.  I just wanted to say that there are some of us that work full time and manage - but it\'s not easy and I don\'t always feel like I\'m managing well.  I don\'t feel like I have much of a life and honestly have just started seeing a therapist to learn how to cope better!  But you\'re not alone - there are those of us out there that work full time and raise a special needs child.  We just do the best we can.  My kids seem happy - my hubby fairly happy so I can\'t be doing that bad, right?    Lisa</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Terra,  Yes, OCD behaviors frequently are part of autism. Some people with autism do take OCD medication to help with that, but behavioral methods also work. Is there a psychologist who consults with your agency? There are methods to stop the behavior or at least transfer the behavior to something less bothersome. Does this client get any kind of positive support for NOT doing these behaviors? Can he earn tokens for a special treat (such as watching a favorite movie, video game or activity)? A positive behavior system may help him. Is there any kind of behavior plan in place for him?</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">LM - I\'m really glad you posted this.  I\'ve been thinking along these same lines and meant to respond when you posted it originally, but got caught up in something else...    I\'m beginning to think that while sensory input may be <em>under</em>valued by the general population, it might be <em>over</em>valued by some of the experts who \"get it\" that it can be beneficial.  In other words, once they understand that sensory integration therapy can be effective for some kids, they (some of them) tend to want to throw a whole bag of sensory activities at a child, even though some of them might not really be warranted for that particular child. Mind you, they probably won\'t hurt either, and in many cases they are fun, which is always a plus for any kid.      For instance, some of the wonderful ideas for calming, etc., are great tools to use in certain circumstances, but I\'m not sure I believe that it is necessary to practice such calming activities with a child who doesn\'t need them simply because they fall under the \"sensory umbrella.\"  (This applies to all areas, not just calming) I hope that makes sense.  In other words, if a child is wound up or hyper, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">by all means </span>use some calming strategies if they work for the child. . . but is it necessary to \"schedule\" something like regular pillow squishes or blanket rolls for a child who is generally calm and compliant, just because it is providing sensory input?  I mean, I suppose it\'s easy enough to incorporate some of these things during down time/physical play time, but I have a hard time seeing why I would want to add such things to my list of things to do and focus on for my son (as if there aren\'t enough already), especially if he is already calm.   I am at least open to seeing things differently, so please feel free to give feedback if you disagree.     Likewise, if a child is tactile defensive, it makes sense to provide a sensory diet that incorporates multiple activities that will gradually expose a child to different textures through play, or perhaps consider the brushing program, but is it necessary to go out of your way to plan for an abundance of these kinds of activities for a child who is not tactile defensive?  (FTR, I do a decent amount of tactile activities from this section with my child, but I do them simply because they are loads of fun and promote learning, and not necessarily because I have my \"sensory cap\" on.)      Don\'t get me wrong, I am in <em>no way </em>knocking sensory integration as a very valuable tool for our kids, but it just seems that some folks have sensory tunnel vision and tend to suggest sensory activities that aren\'t necessarily appropriate or practical for every child.       (Dana - this post came up right after yours, but I in NO way intended to be disrespectful or dismiss your input and passion for sensory integration. I have and will continue to use several of the activities you listed that <em>apply to my son\'s needs</em>.)    *Edited in an attempt to be more clear.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /></div>      <span class=\"gensmall\">Last edited by <a href=\"./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1012&amp;sid=ee97ee48e4793f6516c5955deea43a00\">LittleManzParents</a> on Sat Oct 14, 2006 6:39 am, edited 1 time in total.</span>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hey now.  It isn\'t so bad.  You\'re doing more than you know for him.  Even if it hasn\'t \"worked\" in the sense that he still isn\'t speaking, just imagine how much better he feels, healthier, and not to mention knowing he has a mom like you willing to go through so much for him.  You\'re on the right track.  And even though mine is only 3 1/2 I hear it can take a few years of ABA and other therapies before it really starts to \"work\".  Don\'t be so hard on yourself.  You\'re a mom doing what you can for your kid.  Thats more than a lot of kids could ask for.      The way I look at it, my job as a mom is to take care of my kids, and yeah, that would be a ton easier if my son could tell me what he needs.  So, I\'ll do everything I can for him (and my NT daughter) and if once I\'ve tried everything he hasn\'t picked up anything more than \"hungry\" and \"poopah\" then at least I\'ll know when those two things are needed, but with the added benefit of knowing he probably feels better on the inside too.      Don\'t lose hope.  It\'s so lightweight and easy to lose, that hope.  I think you should be realistic and understand that this new baby boy has a higher chance of having autism, but at the same time, try to think positively.  You\'re already on your way down this road, so if he does, you\'ve got a head start.  Take a bath.  Have a cry.  And try to get up in the morning holding your head high.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I just read today on MSN.com that Colin Farrel has a 4 year old son with Angelman Syndrome.  Isn\'t that a form of Autism?    Recently I went to my local library to find yet another book about Autism to educate myself even more.  There was a book there about having a sibling with autism.  Within it was Angleman Syndrome and that is the first time I had heard of it.    When I read about it, (my daughter has never had a diagnosis, but I always assumed PDD-NOS), some of it sounded like my daughter....strabismus, awkward, loving, affectionate, eye contact.  But some of it didn\'t....different physical facial features, seizures.    Again....no cure for this syndrome.  Just parents plugging away to try to make things the best they can be.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Vicky,  My son is 11, non-verbal, does not read or type, and is destructive. We recently got some funding for a used Panasonic Toughbook CF-18 laptop computer which has a touchscreen. Here are some links about the Toughbook:  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2009/06/23/toughbook-tiger-elephant-technology-personal-test.html\" class=\"postlink\">The Tiger-Resistant Laptop</a>  <a href=\"http://www.tabletpcreview.com/default.asp?newsID=639\" class=\"postlink\">Panasonic Toughbook CF-18 review</a>  My son has been using picture exchange communication (<a href=\"http://www.pecs.org.uk/\" class=\"postlink\">PECS</a>) since he was 3, although he is not proficient at it, he is able to communicate most of his wants with it. He also has a <a href=\"http://www.attainmentcompany.com/product.php?productid=16146&amp;cat=337&amp;page=1\" class=\"postlink\">GoTalk</a> augmentative device which he can use, but again just to request items he wants (mostly foods).  In the past couple of years he has started to request videos by bringing us to the TV or handing us the remote. Usually he seems happy enough with which ever video we put in, but occasionally he will fuss, and then we change videos until we hit on one that he likes. I\'ve tried different ideas to have him choose videos, pictures of the DVD boxes, pictures of Barney, the Wiggles, or Disney (these are what he likes), holding out 2 DVD boxes to let him choose one, and nothing seems to work. He just doesn\'t seem to make the connection between any of the above choices and what is on the screen.  So, I have been searching for a device where my son could touch a picture and then a video would begin playing immediately. One of the other children in my son\'s class has the Toughbook, I talked to her father about it and he offered to loan me one of theirs since they have more than one for school, spare, etc. Once I got it, and got the software to do what I wanted, my son really liked it, so then I decided that it was worth investing in. Luckily, I was able to get funding for the Toughbook and the <a href=\"http://www.mayer-johnson.com/products/boardmaker-plus/\" class=\"postlink\">Boardmaker Plus</a> software. I\'m hoping that his interest in watching videos will lead to more interest in communicating via computer/augmentative devices.  I agree with Bill, if there is a way you could try out any kind of augmentative device that would be best. Also, I don\'t know anything about your son, but if he does not currently have any communication skills, then he would need to be taught basic communication, and then be taught how to use any kind of device.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">quite sane actually, sane and lucid enough to know that the New Testament says NOTHING about the sin of masturbation, rather the sin of lust, etc.     what the Catholic Church says and what applies in this instance have nothing to do with each other, and the topic of masterbation being sinful or not sinful got thrown into this argument for a reason, to cause argument.     Show me in the BIBLE where Jesus says God told him to tell us not to masterbate.    I dont think its good or bad, its neither good nor bad. It just is. The exploration of this issue is now including what the Catholic Church thinks?? Jeez, you know i could go on about sexually repessed priests and nuns, but that would just fuel the fire wouldnt it.     There is no one topic to stick to, regarding this incident, its multi \"topical\" - and has begun with judgments and will end with judgments.    POint being though as you said, the sicko \"professional\" was totally out his head even thinking what he was thinking much less saying it as he was referring to a minor, and should have known better, his triaining in child protection should have forced him not to touch such a subject with a 10 foot pole.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Deb:  Sorry you are going through this.  If you need medication to help you through then this difficult time don\'t feel bad about it.  I personally would love some meds but with my addictive personality I know I\'ll get hooked so I am steering clear.  Once you get more in control of the situation I am sure the panic attacks will subside.  Focus on ways to improve the situation with the school district.  Seeing the DAN doc will definitely help.  You will have many things to pursue and will be busy and productive doing them which should make you feel better.  I feel the same way much of the time.  There are still days that I just cry all day.  I feel like the days are just slipping away and I am not doing everything I can for my son every minute of every day.  It is extremely painful and difficult to deal with.  I have been able to pull myself together and be productive (most of the time) with much of the credit going to all on this board who are sharing this journey.    I do agree with Audrey that seeing a therapist even for just a few sessions may help.  And insurance typically does cover this.  This helped me tremendously when I lost my best friend very suddenly to cancer seven years ago this month.  It\'s a long sad story and I won\'t get into all the details.  I felt responsible because we were away on vacation together and I did not realize how sick she was (neither did she) and then she died.

Obviously I don\'t know where you live or what\'s available in your area, or what you can afford, but a few things to consider (if there\'s room in the budget) are things like Little Gym, Gymboree, Zoo trips, Movie theaters (a local theater in my area has free kids movies every Wednesday morning during the summer!), parks/playgrounds, etc.  You might also find some good (and free or cheap) stuff through your local Parks and Recreation department (or local township, depending on where you live).  They often have special summer activities for kids your son\'s age.     I\'m also thinking about focusing on a \"theme\" for each week but haven\'t yet decided which themes or how to go about it.  I think I\'ll start another post and maybe we can both get some good ideas.     <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\" /></div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I would think at some level he is aware he didn\'t do well on certain areas of the test.  Since he can read facial expressions (which is very good) I\'m sure he picked up that he\'d not performed well on the other theory of mind tests.  And actually I would think it was a good sign that he\'s sad about not passing in that it is a similar reaction to what an NT kid would feel too given a similar situation.  If my NT daughter thinks she\'s disappointed me (theory of mind) there are definately water works!  So if it\'s true and he thinks he\'s disappointed you then wouldn\'t that prove he does have theory of mind at least to some degree?</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I don\'t know their fees but they may be posted on their web site. When we used them many years ago, we did get a little insurance reimbursement for the consultant\'s time because there was a psychologist involved who billed the consultations under a certain code. Of course, we did not get the technicians\' time paid for because the techs were college students whom we hired ourselves. We ended up switching to another agency for various reasons, but CARD did a reasonably good job. (We are NOT in California, so I can\'t speak to that office).</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Wow - this has been fascinating to read.  I am probably out of line for posting on the topic, since I am still learning and sifting through the TONS of information and opinions on the topic.  I\'m also in the process of reading <em>Let Me Hear Your Voice</em> -- only about half way through.      What I have found to be most helpful from reading the book - and these postings - is the re-acknowlegment that the most difficult part of having an autistic child (for me, at least) is the feeling of <em>disconnection</em> with them -- the feeling that they don\'t know, want, need or connect with you in \"normal\" ways.  Regardless of other skills that might be gained in time (which are certainly important to the child\'s future ability to gain independence and self sufficience), I feel that the connection is a <em>core </em>component that cannot be ignored.   Similarly, rather than focusing on getting our son to stack blocks or put rings on a base, our energy has been more refocused on getting him to connect and communicate.  In the big scheme of things, I believe that this connection and ability to communicate -- whatever the method -- will be the foundation for other skills down the road. . .    So I guess what I\'m saying is that it appears to me that there is both good and \"not-so-good\" in many of the behavioral programs and approaches, but it als seems that any effort on the part of the child to connect and communicate should at the very least be acknowleged, if not highly praised.  Like a few other posters mentioned already, I am a big believer in listening to your gut.  I often say that what I lack in intelligence, I make up for with intuition.  (at least this always makes me feel better) <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\" /></div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">What should I look for in a Therapist (Main Things To Look For When Hiring A Therapist)    1- If she doing this to make more money  2-Why does she want to do this type of therapy ?   3-Is she satisfied with what you can pay ?   4- Can she fill the shift you have open ?  5-Is she willing to work at least six to ten hours a week ?  6-Is she available ?   7-Does she have plan for any long vacation or other comitments ?  8-Is she willing to commit for atleast 6 months ?  9-Does she have realiable transportation to your home ?  10-Is she willing to learn new technicques that are unfamiliar to her ?  11-Can she follow precise instructions and do them respetitively ?  12-Is she willing to read  a book and go to training workshops ?  13-Are there any reason NOt to hire her  ?   14-Has  she ever been fired from a job? why ?   15-When you decide on a therapist have a contract ready for her to examine and sighn. This makes everything clear between both parties and will save you future anxiety.    In your contract i I recommend you cover these things.  1-A description of services  2-Proccedure for missing a session  3-The  number of hours per week  she will be working  4-The length of time ( Months)to which she will commit, Make sure she realizes what the job entails before you hire her  5-Where services will take place,  Be thorough and persistant in what you want for your child from her while she is providing services.   6-The pay scale and the varying rates for therapy,meetings,and training, if applicable  7-Performance review periods and pay raises  8-Travel expenses----will it  be cover d and how much ?   9-Taxes. It\'s best for the therapist to be responsible for their own federal,state, and social security taxes.Since the therapist is working for your family as an independent contractor,you\'ll need to provide her with  forms each year covering all payments  10-write a Authorization Confidentiality form about therapy and your child. keep this as a written request. Have her sign it. I hereby request and  authorize ---------- I understand that this authorization is valid for a  period of one year from the date of my signature. Make one copy  for her and keep one in record for you.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />      Some advice that may help  to pay for services.  possible  sources,.  basic stradegies, and  directions for help.   1-Seek Funding  even if it isn\'t easy to obtain  2-Contact other parents in your area and ask how do they fund their program  3-Be well informed, you will need to have accurate information on the therapy you want for your child.   What it is. How it works, And its success, Make copys of as many reserch articles as you can. They may not know or have any information on the therapy you want for your child.   4- Take video of your child before you start therapy setions and after you started. A picture can speak more powerfully than words.  5- Research ahead of time so you know exactly how much money you will need for how long  6- Get a good lawyer who has experience in obtaining funding for your program You will need his /her experties  7-Medical Assistance may pay the wages of the therapist in some states.  8-Foind out if your state has any programs  like waivers or wraparound  programs that will cover expenses. these programs  are Not usually publicized,so ask around.   9- Sometimes school are offerd  grants to try alternative programs but most schools don\'t take advantage of them.  Grants, Insurance, College Students,(Volunteers) Aren\'t always dependable or long lasting therapist.     In the  mist  of all the logics and research and potential lifestyles changes, it\'s easy to lose sight of the goal. Every child have the opportunity to receive the treatment that has has been proven to offer the best chance  for combating a disorder. A professionally run, in tensive program can help our childrento grow and learn. Our children have so  much time and we have limited resources, so we cannot afford to waste time or mony. Good  Luck   to you and your child.</div>'

Anway, I\'m trying desperately to figure it out:  1) He has been on MB12 shots since Feb 06 and is a responder...but have had to take him off folinic acid because it makes him over-react to everything....He gets 200 mg folic acid in his B-complex...but that is all at this point.  Could that lack of enough folic acid result in this emotional roller coaster?  2) He is such a mood cycler kid that I have been having a hard time adding in all the supplements that Dr. Neubrander suggests.  It is just hard to tell if something is helping or hurting....So are there certain supplements that would cause worsening moods/irritability/anxiety while on MB12 if they were lacking?  3)  Son was scoped June 1 and nitrous oxide was used.  I am just now learning that that was a BAD idea.  Could the N.O. cause worsening in moods?  4) He is SCD for about 2 months now.  Could the prep for the scope have stirred up things in the gut and caused imbalance--could this be yeast or bacteria issues?  I\'m not seeing rashes or skin issues that might indicate yeast...  5) Dr. Krigsman thinks that the behavior with improve with treatment for gut issues (even though his biopsy looked good)--some kids respond to gut treatment even though no damage/inflammation is detected.  The protocol he wants to use is Fladgyl and Pentasa.    Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I try to ignore it because if I go in there he really will wake up and will definitely want to come into our room, which is a no-no for us. We\'re afraid of starting a habit -- and besides, he kicks!

' <div class=\"postbody\">My girl seemed typical for a while--I remember at 12 months, my son told me that she didn\'t want to play with him anymore.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" />  My husband said (later) that she would look \'through\' him instead of at him. I never noticed that. There was one time when she was a few weeks old and began to fuss in her seat. i leaned over to talk to her and soothe her. I couldn\'t get her to look at me no matter what. But that was the only time. I have oodles of photos of her looking at me and smiling. She always looked at me up until around maybe 15 months when she began to be unhappy. Whiny, didn\'t want to play, started to get difficult to take to stores, etc. One other sign was her scratching her bottom every night when I bathed her. i would put her in the big tub but only fill it with two inches of water. Half her cute tush was sticking out and she would reach one or both hands behind to scratch her buttcheeks. I couldn\'t stop her. I thought that was the oddest thing. Now I know it was yeast.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /> The saddest part is that a friend told me to start probiotics and I didn\'t listen.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" />  She never got sick but the two times she did--look out! RSV at 5 months with steroids for treatment. Pertussis at 12 months--lasted all summer! (she caught it AFTER being vaccinated against it  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x\" title=\"Mad\" /> )  I recognized that she wasn\'t talking but wasn\'t too worried. I recognized that she was getting difficult but thought she was just strong-willed. I saw that other kids her age were \'getting\' stuff (discipline, teaching, understanding) while she wasn\'t but I rationalized that she would do things in her own time. From about 20--24 months she was pretty unbearable. Couldn\'t take her anywhere anymore.  At 24 months a friend told me to look up PDD when I fretted to her that my girl had never ponited or waved. When I did, I stayed online all night. I couldn\'t believe my girl fit most of these profiles! She was diagnosed severe on Oct 19th, 2005 when she was 27 months old.  We had already started the GFCF diet in August and saw our first DAN in early October. In November we started the MB12 shots and treated for yeast and bacteria. By Thanksgiving she said hi to a worker in our house, pointed for the first time, and began to speak words again. On Christmas she stared into my eyes for the first time in so long, and she did \'head and shoulders, knees and toes\' with the words!  She has been a tough nut to crack, though.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /> She is always two steps forward, one step back.

' <div class=\"postbody\">DavidsMama,  It sounds like they dropped the ball with David.  Before S. could talk I had to really stress with caregivers that crying was his form of communication.  Try not to be too discouraged if the first three days were good, we all have a bad day once in a while (I\'m talking about the teachers).  I think Jend had some really good ideas about having written action plan.  Do his teacher and paras have much experience with kids with ASD?  It sounds like David isn\'t very verbal yet.  Could it just be ignorance and you can work with them?    I just had to sit down with S.\'s new teacher at end of the first week and give a written list of ways to keep him focused.  Obviously, that\'s very different from letting a kid cry for six hours (what were they thinking?).   But, I realized after speaking with his teacher that she thought he was hyperactive and hadn\'t realized he had sensory and auditory processing issues.   Communicating with has made a huge difference for both of them.  Good luck.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I find our son is actually small and doesn\'t look his age of 6.  He\'s skin and bones and has height, but is certainly no bigger than any of the other kids in his current class.  It never occured to me to consider his size.    He is also a very good looking boy - big brown eyes with long, long eyelashes that girls would kill for!  People are always commenting on his looks and what a sweet little guy he is...      Thanks LindaC.  It was interesting to read a totally different view.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Congratulations!  Welcome to the strange world of ASD!  I cried the first time my son really lied, I almost through a party.     S. told me he hated me yesterday, I was tthrilled.  He hates me!  A typical response of a six year old being punished for lying.  He stomped up the stairs to his room, told me he hated me, and his dad was a nice guy and I wasn\'t nice at all.    I think lying is a milestone because it shows he understands other people think differently than him.  Saturday, I had a horrible day and I was on the phone with my friend and I was crying.  S. saw me crying and touched me and asked what was wrong?  He asked if playing a video game or some juice would make me feel better?  Than he tried to distract me by showing me the dog on the couch and how silly he was being.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Respect,    hahaha, I was wondering about that. I\'ll be sure to give you a shout when I have my degree (at the rate I\'m going I\'ll have a good 5 years experience with ABA by then...darn transfers...)    I have to say, that all of you parents who are willing to fork out this kind of money amaze me. I have families who are provided with almost FREE therapy through the WI autism waiver program, but refuse to fork out the dough for their kids to do community outings that they are requesting us to take their kids on (and when you\'re working with a child in a rural area, it\'s easy to spend $15 dollars on gas and admission to a zoo, or lunch...bye bye paycheck!)    I realized just now how sad it is that I\'m so excited about the family I\'m started with. They\'re paying me out of pocket to do therapy a couple of hours a week so they can learn what kinds of things they can be working on with their son. I\'ve only had one other family who was willing to do those things, and I think that\'s just awful. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" />    In a way I wish some of my families would have to see how valuable these therapy resources are by losing their funding, I think it\'d be a swift kick in the rear to open up their eyes to do some of the work themselves...    Good luck with the Aide, Respect.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Lots of exposure and repetition!     Does David like videos? If so there are a ton of alphabet videos out there that might help.  The BBB Alphabet Phonics is a good one.  There are also some good music CDs that sing the alphabet and alphabet-related songs.    Also, introduce it through play.  Enthusiastically point out letters on blocks or puzzle or books . . . or street signs, etc.  If he\'s able and not sensory defensive, maybe even make art projects involving the alphabet.  It could be as simple as cutting out a large block letter, having him color or paint it, and hanging it up somewhere in sight.  Then you can refer back to it and compare it to other As in the house (on blocks, books, etc.)    Oh, and there are also some Leap Pad toys like the Alphabet Phonics fridge magnets that might help. (speaking of which, those little magnetic letters you can get at the dollar store and a magnet board are cheap and easy to find)    As far as how you\'ll know if he\'s getting it, I would think that you\'ll know when he understands and responds if you ask him to give you the B block or point to the C, etc.      It\'s great that he\'s doing so well at school!!  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\" /></div>'

Taking 2 years of speech therapy in high school helped me improve in many areas (reading, writing, vocabulay words, speech, and so on). After speech therapy, it became easier for me to learn in regular classes.   There are many theories on where autism came from. I don\'t know why I have it and where I got it from.

She knows how to do things just somehow she can\'t do it.  It is kind of hard to explain.  She could feed herself but she won\'t.

' <div class=\"postbody\">*Fort Myers youth is ready; colleges aren\'t*  *Home-schooler with Asperger\'s syndrome can\'t take GED test for two years*  *by dave breitenstein Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ dbreitenstein@... Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ March 2, 2009 *    Kaymen Lackey is ready for college.  High school coursework was a piece of cake, and he\'s eyeing a major in computer technology or design.  There\'s just one problem.  Kaymen is only 14 and, chronologically, should be in eighth grade.  The Fort Myers youth has hit a roadblock in his quest to graduate college before his peers graduate high school. As a home-schooler, he is unable to arbitrarily skip grade levels, and the American Council on Education sets a minimum age of 16 to take the GED test.  He\'s stuck - no matter how smart he is.  &quot;He\'s already tested out of math,&quot; said Kaymen\'s mother, Lena. &quot;I\'m not going to make him sit there and do math workbooks that he\'s done already.&quot;  Kaymen is no ordinary teenager, and is home- schooled for a reason. He has Asperger\'s syndrome, a form of autism in which individuals have normal intelligence and language development, but the neurobiological disorder affects social skills and communications. He acts up at times, rocking in his chair.  He gets bored, and lets you know it. He has his own ideas on what\'s relevant to learn, and what is just busy work.  Lena turned to Rasmussen College, which opened an education center in Fort Myers, last summer. The college is providing a tutor - retired guidance counselor John Grassina - and allows Kaymen to enroll in one course per quarter through an early-admissions program. He\'ll still be classified as a high school student until he turns 16 and passes the GED, but will receive college credit along the way.  (2 of 2)    &quot;He was always saying \'This is wasting my time,\'&quot; Lena Lackey said. &quot;He\'d say, \'I need to know how to do this, this, this, this and this.\'&quot;  [image: Advertisement]  That\'s part of Asperger\'s syndrome, giving him a one-track mind. Right now, he\'s totally into cinematography, learning how to film, produce and edit video. He participates in a medical explorers program, getting a hands-on introduction to medicine.  Leigh Anna Nowak, a consultant for the University of Florida\'s Center for Autism &amp; Related Disabilities, says it\'s very common to see highly intelligent students with Asperger\'s syndrome.  &quot;Oftentimes, you\'ll find persons with Asperger\'s are very good at the academic part of school,&quot; said Nowak, who is based at Florida Gulf Coast University. &quot;It\'s the social part they struggle with.&quot;  Kaymen admits that fact. He doesn\'t like large groups, socializing or sitting still for an entire class period.  &quot;You\'re stuck in one seat for an allotted amount of time,&quot; he explained.  Kaymen bounced between schools in Delaware, Kentucky and Florida, most recently enrolling at Richard Milburn Academy, a charter high school in Fort Myers that targets non-traditional students. He adjusted well at first, but then lost interest.  &quot;Every single day, he just sat out in the hallway and read, read, read,&quot; Lena Lackey said. &quot;He was literally reading a book a day.&quot;  Kaymen remembers much of what he sees and reads, and says his memories are almost like he\'s watching himself in action. As far as book smarts, that boils down to repetition.  &quot;When you hear something enough times, it just sticks, but I wouldn\'t call myself a genius or anything,&quot; Kaymen said.  &quot;No, I\'m not like Rain Man,&quot; he added, referring to the character in a film by that name starring Dustin Hoffman as an adult with autism and Tom Cruise as Hoffman\'s brother.  Kaymen already took math, writing and reading entrance exams at Rasmussen - all without studying.  &quot;He placed higher than most of my students,&quot; said academic dean Tara McIlmoil.  For Kaymen, school is boring. If he knows the material, as he does with high school academics, he just wants to climb to the next level.  &quot;When you\'re running a marathon, you moderate yourself until the end,&quot; Kaymen said. &quot;I just want to hurry up and finish, and get a job.&quot;</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ I had to be there, to get here.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ I had to be there, to get here.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I didn\'t actually try it because my son was already in a class that was doing Discrete Trial which is just way more intense and was designed for autism.  I did call and get some specifics about the total transformation program and it sounds a lot to me like a version of ABA run by the parent which I think is great and would definately have tried if I had any ADHD kids.  But then I really think that so much of what can be accomplished with meds can be accomplished with behavior modification and would always go with the non med approach first be it behavioral modification or diet (GFCF diet has also been recomended for ADHD) and only then if there is no progress try the meds.    I have also noticed that my son gets more difficult behaviorally when he is sick too.  Although now that he is really starting to verbalize (he\'s eight) in willingly initiating communication he has no problem telling me he is sick.  He\'s even started telling me he\'s sick when he\'s not so that he can sleep in.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I used to post on this forum a lot, but work and life just got in the way. I\'m in a serious RUT now, and just need to vent, if anyone cares to listen - and if you can offer advice as to how to get out of a run, pls let me know!    Joey has turned 7 as of August, and is in the 1st grade now. We held him back a year and repeated kindergarten, and it was a very postive move.     Academically, he is doing fantastic -- better than I had expected. He\'s reading 1st grade words, although not yet reading for pleasure.His papers show him completing all the grade level work, and he didn\'t not really require any special assitance w/ reading. He still sits in sped ed classes, but is mainstreamed for most of the day w/ pull outs for academics where he needs to concentrate. Teachers seem to love him.     We stopped ABA about a year or so ago when our consultants were bearing down on us too hard. We really haven\'t done much of anything in the way of therapy. I\'d LIKE to do more RDI, but we can\'t afford it.  I\'d also like to get him started w/ auditory integration therapy, but am just afraid of the costs.     Biomedically, I was a very involved Yasko mom, and then my husband deployed to Iraq, and with working full time, it has all sort of fizzled out. For this I feel TERRIBLE. I can\'t seem to get into it again . ..it\'s just so freaking HARD. We\'re still GFCF, out of habit, and we do MB12 shots when I can get the RX\'s filled. We are in need of a return visit to a DAN, but can\'t seem to find anyone GOOD and LOCAL.  I just vascillate w/ Yasko all the time ....     Right now his temperament is MOODY and he is extremely negative, although I get no negative reports from school. He has absolutely NO friends from school who seem to want to play after school. Granted most of them are in after school daycare, but not a single kid ever comes over to play. Our neighborhood is also very sparse w/ kids his age.     Right now I just feel isolated and in a rut with him. He\'s mouthy to me a lot, screams, only wants to sit in the basement and play Nintendo. We don\'t have him in any after school activities at the moment . . .and I will admit, I\'m almost just afraid of trying anything with his negative moods.     And it just all stinks -- he is the CUTEST kid ever, loves to play, but I just can\'t find the right outlet for him. It\'s all just so much work . ...I don\'t know, I\'m just in a mood not to want to work through it sometimes and try to make all the arrangements ....      Can anyone relate to just feeling in a rut?     Perhaps I just need to start him up in ABA again, just to get that support.     Anyway, thanks for listening. I was the most dedicated autism mom EVER about 2 years ago -- and we have had so much progress -- but you burn out eventually. I never though it would happen, but it has . ..how to break out of it???</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Joey, 6 yrs., PDD-NOS  GFCF, Yasko, RDI  Did ABA for 14 mos.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Joey, 6 yrs., PDD-NOS  GFCF, Yasko, RDI  Did ABA for 14 mos.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">LM,    It\'s your child, and you\'re the one paying for your consultants. I would think that if you want to focus more on functional skills than preacademics and the like, that your consultant should be at least willing to meet you halfway.     When I first read this I was going to say that we work primarily on academics with our younger kids, and once they get to around age 10 we work more on self-help and life-skills, but that\'s not true. The first program we worked on with one of my kids was getting him to sit at the table to eat, so he could eat in a restaurant or just have a family meal with his parents. We also work on dressing, hygiene and similar skills with most of the kids that I work with, and as they get older we also begin to incorporate chores of increasing difficulty (putting dishes in sink leads to rinsing dishes leads to loading dishwasher/washing by hand; putting dirty clothes in the basket leads to starting washing machine, leads to putting clothes in the dryer, leads to folding and putting away; etc...)    I\'d talk to your consultant. No matter what age your child is they should be working on at least some of these skills. If I\'m right I think that your DS is around the age of 5(?), some appropriate things they could be working on is receptive/expressive ID of clothing, receptive/expressive ID of kitchen appliances/utensils/cookware, fine motor skills for dressing such as snaps/buttons/zippers/tying laces, hygiene (showering, brushing teeth, washing hands, etc.)    From what I\'ve experienced on the teams I\'ve been on is therapy programs should and do revolve around the individual families needs, not the ideals of the consultant. If there is a program that whoever is in charge really believes that your DS needs to work on, then maybe it should be worked on, but she should be just as willing to work on programs that are important to you. I know that my Senior Therapist has had to completely re-write treatment plans due to parents requesting that different skills be worked on, and although it was a pain for her to do that, she did it because it\'s important to address the needs of each individual family. Therapists should not complicate the lives of the child\'s family members, therapists should be there to help.     Good luck! If you need any other ideas, let me know and maybe I can help you out!      Jess</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I was just like you.  I knew he was different but but deep in my heart I was just hoping that they would tell me his was just behind and everything would be fine.  I got moderate autism.  I think I cried for 2 years.  I know every child is different, but there is hope.  My son is now 9 and you probably would not be able to tell he has autism.  He plays organized sports, he plays with all the neighborhood kids at the swimming pool.  He wants to play with others, he\'s not in his own world anymore.  He is a sports fanatic.  He watches any sports he can find on tv.  He has his moments, especially when he\'s very tired, but all in all he is a totally different child from when he was 3-5 years old.  I tried various different treatments, etc..  I hope I have helped him along the way.  We are currently doing DMSA orally and I think he is a little more in tune with people.  He actually asks his friends if they are ok when they get hurt.  He has never done that.  He talked on the phone last night and it was the best talking I have ever heard from him.  So, I hope that it is working.  Hang in there, it\'s normal to cry. Plus, you just have to get it out sometimes.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">hoping the new situation you will find will be better b/c im sure it cant be worse.     we did have issue in kindergarden just b/c 5 year olds are kinda a self centered selfish bunch by nature but now that the maturity of a year has come the kids are great always including and trying to find things they can do with my child.     we have never had a problem with my oldest either...luck? maybe!!! i seem to think it is the catholic system model here in canada placing the most merit on values and morals and basic christian living right from the start of education in preschool. they deal head on with the issues of freindship, inclusion and above all showing God\'s love to one another no matter the diffrences. one little girl said to me about a down\'s girl when i was volunteering \"she has just a little bit of trouble walking, but thats okay we love her just the same and do our best to help her along.\"     just the sweetest vision through her eyes, the problem was insignificant where i saw a girl unable to be without her wheelchair or walker it was only a little bit of trouble to this friend.    all children deserve to have a friend or friends and a group of individuals to count on for support and caring outside of the family unit. even if it is facilitated or manipulated with adults helping it along it will foster and become easy for our children to grow up loved by all but it has to start and i hope and pray you will find that start.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Lisalynn  keeping hope and faith through it all.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Lisalynn  keeping hope and faith through it all.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">hi jend  thanks for your question, i really need to straighten this out!.. I live in long island, home to mammoth school districts with great services but i happen to live in a tiny district sandwiched between 2 mammoths.. And at this tiny one they have a lot of heart but at the kindergarden level they do not have any options that we feel are appropriate for a child with HFA or Aspergers (Which we suspect that his diagnosis may be).. They do not have aides with children in the class except when child is normal/high cognitive and extreme behavior management issues,  which my son does not have.. Only 1 or 2 kids in district have this support.. The only option offered to us (other than regular ed, which is what was suggested) is \"inclusion class\" which is half-typical/half-IEP kids..The IEP kids have mostly speech and academic needs and he would be the only ASD kid there.  There is no specific soical skills training and we were told that the school is not responsible for \"helping kids make friends\" . It is also only half-day kindergarden, which is not normal for long island.. other districts have full day.. There is also a self-contained class but they told us its not approprate for him though i would prefer him to be in that class than out in regular ed with no support at all.    So ultimlately we might move a couple of miles away to get into the kind of program where he would have an aide and then get pulled for one hour of specific ASD instruction in social skills.      we\'ve already been on the phone with McCarton a few times and they are asking all the right questions and seem to be tweaking how they will test him, so looking good already.    irene</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ proud mom of zachary age 3 1/2 with PDD-NOS</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ proud mom of zachary age 3 1/2 with PDD-NOS</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Are you concerned about Asperger\'s? Some kids who seem to have Asperger\'s at a young age do seem less so later on, but I agree with you it never hurts for a parent to have a child evaluated and this is free here in the States.    However, I think you run the risk of alienating and upsetting the parents very much, especially if you turn out to be wrong and even if you\'re right! I think it\'s very hard to diagnose high-functioning kids and it\'s always hard to diagnose Asperger\'s which is why those kids tend to get a diagnosis so much later than ours do. I have a friend whose daughter is clearly Asperger\'s. She insists its ADHD (which she has too), but she won\'t get her help for the social skills. The child is bright so the mom feels that there\'s no way it can be anything connected to autism. (I guess that tells you how she views autism. She has probably read the old stories that say that 75 percent of autistic people have mental retardation.)    From what I hear, it\'s hard to get any services for Asperger\'s especially if the kid is as bright as the one you describe. Maybe some of the Asperger\'s parents on board can help with this. Even if the child had a diagnosis, would any help be available in the UK for him?</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ â€œThe seeking is the goal and the search is the answerâ€</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ aThe seeking is the goal and the search is the answera</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I don\'t think I would use it for my son.  I think it\'s meant for kids over 7.

Erin\'s OT gave her some black glasses that have a solid black plastic lenses with many small holes in them. When she wears them she can trace and read better but she is so resistent to them. I don\'t know why. I put them on and after awhile the pinholes seem to disappear and you just view what\'s right in front of you. I love in the directions that came with them it says don\'t attempt to drive with them on. I can just see someone doing that!

When I walked into the room I was taken back by the low noise level.. the kids speak softly as do the teachers. A teacher was reading a book about feelings in one corner. A couple of the children were over at the tables. One girl had some shells and some water. I asked why she wasn\'t with the other kids. The director said \"well, she\'s not done washing her shells\"..     My son went over and sat with the girl and I thought \"oh no\" whats going to happen next. My son got a shell and some water and started washing his shells..It was absolutely beautiful.. Then he kept looking up and around him, I think he was waiting for a teacher to pounce on him and tell him what to do.     When the kids finished their story they all went to \"work\" around the room on all the various activities. If a child went to work on the floor, they put down a mat that is used to define their workspace. Children invite other children to work with them, but their is no grabbing other children\'s work which is on the mat.    MY child was approacted 8 TIMES in 45 minutes with invitations to \"work\" together and he did so well.  I don\'t think he picked up the nuances of the social \"code\" in the room (at one point he said really loud \"HEY KIDS GUINEA PIG OVER HERE and tried to whistle), but was thinking how amazing it would be if he did pick it up.    Has anyone else had any experience with Montessori school..??  I think that my son would need some prep time (dancing lessons to use Mommy in CA analogy) before starting this, but the payoff would be amazing. He would also need to keep the other half of his day with ABA so he can keep catching up with this other skills...    Irene</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">LOL, my hubby used to run an Army recruiting company. When he heard this he just said, \"well as long as he could pass the ASVAB.\"  I guess he does not discriminate against those with autism.      There are quite a lot of recruits that tend to be on the quiet side. Maybe the boy was so high functioning he just passed as a regular kid.

' <div class=\"postbody\"><strong>Are you a care-provider of someone diagnosed with autism? We need your help! </strong>  The Wall Lab at Harvard Medical School has created a shortened  diagnostic survey. Because autism varies widely in severity, making an  accurate diagnosis can be difficult. Autism can be diagnosed through the  use of a behavioral exam named the &quot;Autism Diagnostic Interview -  Revised or ADI-R. However, because this survey is long - it has 93  questions and can take up to 2.5 hours to complete - the diagnosis  process can be prohibitive.   We have designed a substantially shorter exam of 7 questions that we  believe may be as effective as the ADI-R at diagnosing autistic children.  Should this prove to be true, our exam would help healthcare providers  diagnose autistic children more rapidly and enable children to receive  valuable therapy that is more in tune with the timing of their development  and more likely to have a positive outcome. One big way to determine if  our abbreviated exam is effective is to get your help.   If you are a care provider for a person with autism, your answers to the  few questions in the survey will tell us whether our exam actually works.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I have to say, i havent enjoyed a thread more than reading the responses to this one.     Having had an inborn desire to \"buck\" the system all my life (I paid for it in a myriad of ways) I could easily attribute my accompanying lack of social niceties and decorum to an autistic type label. MOreso, though, i attribute this to the way i grew up and to the influence of my own family, who were a lot like me. Is this chicken and egg scenario? I dont know. Do born again, George Bush loving, gun toting free masons have autistic kids? Yep. So i doubt it makes any difference what social environment you grow up in, or what your genes were like.(sorry if i offended you who might be members of the above noted category).    However, in looking at the above posts, i see so many attributes of similar behaviour throughout the family. I can bet we ALL see these attributes in our families in one way or another, and in other families too.     Makes we wonder about the musings entitled \"the age of autism\" which i googled recently. Have we reached the societal age where we can no longer deny these attributes? Is autism like a big pimple that now, has no alternative but to pop?? he he Autism, the big pimple theory.     respect</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Yes, Alex started preschool in January.  He\'s in an integrated class for language and social skills.  He seems oblivious to the other kids, as he is to most people besides our family and his teacher.  His teacher is, yes, very helpful to us and full of support and suggestions.  Next year, he\'s going into a class specifically for autistic kids.  I think that he\'d get more out of that.  We\'re waiting for a space to open up.    Noah is so far beyond even a regular 5 year old, so he and Alex don\'t have many activities in common.  Noah is emotionally 5, but intellectually much further along. I was so happy during that playdoh moment!  If you (or anyone!) have any more ideas of what these two could share, I\'d love to hear.  Noah really wants to interact with Alex, but doesn\'t quite know how.  And I\'m at a loss, too.    I\'d be THRILLED to see a green mohawk on Alex some day!

' <div class=\"postbody\">My son lives in a house with a turtle, hamster, 2 bunnies, 4 fish tanks we have friends with dogs and who all wash with stuff that I most certainly could not use and does not have allergies.  Something was wrong funny little side note.  If I picked up my younger son with Autism from school first and he had to go into my older son\'s school he was fine on all the other floors but once you hit that main floor and now that I think about it (only floor with carpet) he goes crazy I don\'t mean sorta crazy.  I mean banging his head on the lockers and screaming and throwing himself on the floor crazy.  Something is not right.  I am so scared for him to have to go to school there but we have 2 1/2 more years before I have to worry about it and maybe I could find a better placement for the 3 years he would need to go there.  Really the more I think about it I really wonder if the child in question is not reacting to the school not everything else.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">HUH?  Did I miss something?</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">My son already went. We got back this afternoon. I wanted to post this to share our experience. With my son, if we tell him about things in advance, and talk about it a lot, he does better when it happens. Something had to happen that we weren\'t expecting, and there were other things I simply forgot to mention. If your kid does better knowing things in advance, and you have an EEG or MRI to go to, consider reading this post.  <em>Anything *\'d is something that may vary based on your hospital or the kind of test you are having done, but I figure the list will still help you think of what kind of questions to ask the doctor about what to expect.</em>  <strong>Arrival at hospital</strong>: 1) Parking Garage* 2) Stop at Entry Desk to show ID\'s* 3) Registration: This required waiting in line, signing in and giving insurance information and ID, then sitting and waiting in the waiting area until a bed was ready in the pediatric unit. We had a snack while we waited and played games. 4) Someone comes down with a wheelchair and wheels us onto the service elevator up to the pediatric floor, and then to our room, where our son gets his own bed. (there may or may not be another kid in the room. The bathroom was on the other kid\'s side and we had to cross it every time to use the bathroom)  An idea of our wait times: Arrival: 9am. Schedule start time: 10am. Arrived to room: 10:30am Procedure Started: 12:00pm  <strong>EEG</strong> (As much as I remember) <em>Note: We had a 23 hour EEG, which is not necessarily 23 hours but *up to* 23 hours. Note: My son is 5 years old. His EEG was to check for silent seizures and see if there was anything contributing to his night terrors/hallucinations. Note: You have to have freshly cleaned, dry hair with no hair products in it for the EEG</em> 1) Lay down. 2) The solution they use on your head has a strong smell. 3) They part your hair in different place and put the solution on, then they put a whitish gel on one of the the little thingees (that means I don\'t know what it\'s called, but it\'s a small little disk thing)The stick that disk thing to your head. 4) They blow REALLY COLD air to dry these little pieces of gauze over each disk thing. 5) It takes a while, but you can play a video game or watch a movie while they do it. Some of the &quot;sticky things&quot; will go on your forehead. 6) When this is set up, the put a stocking like thing over your head. It covered my son\'s eyes and nose for a minute, which he didn\'t like, but not his mouth. This was only while they taped it into place, then they folded it back. The rest of the stocking thing covered the wires. 7) They may not hook you up to the machine right away, but they will eventually (we waited over an hour for this step.) <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\" /> You have to stay plugged into the machine at all times, which means you are stuck in bed and have to bring the machine with you to the bathroom. 9) It doesn\'t hurt, or it\'s not supposed to, though it could be upsetting to kids with sensory issues.  <strong>Being in a Hospital</strong> <em>They will want to check your blood pressure and breathing and eyes a lot while you are there. My son hated having his blood pressure taken. One of the times he kicked the nurse. Another time he refused so wildly that they couldnt get a read. After we talked about it, and it wasn\'t a surprise anymore, he said, &quot;Okay, she can come do my arm now.&quot; (which means take my blood pressure)</em> <strong> MRI</strong> 1) If you are having an MRI with contrast or sedation or they need to check your kidneys for any reason, there will be needles involved (I WISH i KNEW THIS AHEAD OF TIME!) They have to take blood, use the IV site to inject the contrast, and use the IV site to inject the sedation, and to do the IV fluids afterward. The blood taking and the other things are done at separate times.  2) The MRI required a wheelchair down to the first flood (in our case). They saw us right away. The MRI took about 30-40 minutes, start to finish. 3) My son got an ice Popsicle afterward.  I don\'t know anything more about the MRI, sorry. I do know they can sometimes, for some things, do an oral contrast, but they can\'t do that for sedation or bloodwork if you need the bloodwork. Some people don\'t need sedation though.  <strong>Further Suggestions</strong>: 1) As your doctors lots of questions about the procedures above if you need more information on how their hospital does things specifically 2) Watch videos on things like taking blood, having blood pressure taken, etc, if you think it will help you child. (with my son, when I said he was getting his blood taken, he screamed at me and called me a liar for 20 minutes, but then he calmed down, and when they came to take his blood he was fine--he does much better with advance notice). 3) Maybe make a picture book to bring with you of all the steps. 4) Let your child know that you might be forgetting something, but that most of the time they will be able to talk to you before anything happens. 5) Bring movies and a way to watch movies (if you kid likes movies) in case they don\'t have a DVD player or the DVD player is broken. Brings books, games, activities, toys, anything you think they personally like and will keep them entertained. 6) Bring a pillow. They almost never have a spare if you are spending the night. 7) Bring your own toiletries. Hospital shampoo/conditioner sucks! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\" /> Bring you own food and snacks. (You can! In a cooler! --especially if your child is a picky eater or has food allergies, because otherwise you end up with very slim pickings.) 9) Bring something for you to do during the quiet moments. a book to read or a movie of your own.  In the end, my son did great, and he was happy to go home but he didn\'t mind being there for his &quot;sleepover appointment&quot; either. It will take a lot longer than you think. I expected I wouldn\'t be out of there until 5ish, but that was with thinking the eeg would be a full 23 hours (and that they would start late) but they started late and ended early and did the MRI early, but they were late for the mri LOL--and STILL we didn\'t leave until until 5. MRI was over at 9. We left around 5ish. Just to give you an idea how slow paced the sedation recovery (and they said he recovered fast) can be, along with discharge. Of course, so much of this will vary hospital to hospital, day to day, doctor to doctor, etc.    Okay, I don\'t know how helpful this was. If I\'m missing anything I can add, let me know. If you have any other questions, let me know. I just thought it\'d be nice if anyone had to do something like this they could have a &quot;what to expect&quot; post to refer to, so anyone who can pitch in to make this better, that would be great.</div>'

The antibiotic is one of the medications that looks promising for increasing socialization in autistic children.   Researchers have identified some medications that help autistic youngsters socialize.   For example, when autistic children were given selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or atypical antipsychotics in open-label studies, they became more spontaneous than before and interacted more with other people than before. However, these medications\' putative ability to increase socialization in autistic youngsters has yet to be demonstrated in placebo-controlled trials. Also, it is not yet known whether the purported socialization benefits derive from a direct impact on socialization or via an indirect effectâ€”say, by reducing irritability and anxiety.   Still another medication that looks promising for autistic children is the antibiotic D-cycloserine, a pilot study reported in the November American Journal of Psychiatry suggests. The study was headed by David Posey, M.D., an assistant professor of psychiatry at Indiana University and director of the university\'s autism treatment center.   Various factors prompted Posey and his colleagues to undertake a pilot study to determine whether D-cycloserine might increase socialization in autistic children. In addition to being used to treat tuberculosis for 45 years, D-cycloserine enhances the activity of the neurotransmitter glutamate in the brain. Adding low doses of D-cycloserine to antipsychotics other than clozapine can temper social withdrawal in persons with schizophrenia, several studies have suggested. D-cycloserine has been safely used in children at high doses to treat tuberculosis, and the low doses of D-cycloserine used in persons with schizophrenia have produced limited side effects.   In the pilot study by Posey and his coworkers, 10 individuals who met a DSM-IV diagnosis of autism and who were on average 10 years old received a placebo for two weeks, then three different, ascending doses of D-cycloserine during each of three two-week periods. The daily doses were about 0.7 mg/kg, 1.4 mg/kg, and 2.8 mg/kg, respectively. The subjects\' social withdrawal was measured with four yardsticks at the start of the study, at the end of the placebo phase, and at the end of each two-week phase. The yardsticks were the Clinical Global Impression Scale, the Social Responsiveness Scale, a modified Children\'s Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist.   Test results were encouraging. For example, subjects performed significantly better on the Clinical Global Impression Scale after they had received the medium and high doses of D-cycloserine than they had at the start of the study. Subjects performed significantly better on the social withdrawal subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist after they had gotten the highest dose of D-cycloserine than they had at the start of the study (see chart). In four of 10 subjects, social improvement was clinically meaningful.   One of these four subjects was 5-year-old \"Greg.\" Greg had been in individual speech therapy and in group social skills training with a speech and language therapist for two years. The therapist was not informed about Greg\'s participation in the D-cycloserine study. Nonetheless, she noted marked improvement in his attention, spontaneous use of language, and initiation of social interaction while he was on D-cycloserine.   The pilot study was financed by the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD), the National Institutes of Health, a Daniel X. Freedman Psychiatric Fellowship Award, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.   A randomized, double-blind, placebo-a controlled trial to further explore D-cycloserine\'s impact on socialization in autistic subjects got under way earlier this year, Posey told Psychiatric News. It is being funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and NARSAD.   The study, \"A Pilot Study of D-Cycloserine in Subjects With Autistic Disorder,\" is posted online at &lt;http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/161/11/2115?&gt;</div></div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Today my son is having a bad day.  The therapist who is here is new so I can tell him what to do (I thought <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /> ).    I came up with an idea that I really like.  When my son is having a bad day, there should be a whole different set of programs for how to act when you\'re having a bad day.      What we did today, when my son had holed up in his closet and kept yelling at everyone to go away, was this:    I told the therapist to go get some puppets (serious A-level reinforcer for DS.)  DS would not let the puppets in the closet with him and even pretended to hang a \"you can\'t come in\" sign on the door.    So I told the therapist to have each puppet ask DS if he could come in, and what we were going to do at that moment was teach DS how to be polite when refusing someone when he\'s having a bad day, since we ALL have them and need to learn how to at least be civil.      The therapist figured out by this point that he might be doing something the supervisor might not like, so he kind of slipped out saying \"uh, maybe we can talk about this at clinic\", but I thought it was a great idea and prompted this a few times myself.  It was great because after a few times, DS was saying very calmly \"no thank you, I don\'t want to play,\" and I was withdrawing the puppet immediately and not returning for another couple minutes each time.      So it then occurred to me, <em>how</em> can we ask kids who are having a bad day to come out of it, interact and learn at the pace set for them on their best day, and reach for all the same high goals the same way they would on any other day?  It seems odd.  We really do <strong>all </strong>have days where we feel like c--- and don\'t want to do anything but chill, but we need a <em>whole different set of social skills </em>during those days in order not to insult anyone and remain civil and polite.    It would be like telling an adult that they had to go at full speed 40 hours a week, after work, no matter how sick or tired or just upset or depressed or angry or what, learning all kinds of new skills that might be very hard.    My ABA agency wants (in cases where my son is, for example, holed up in his closet) the therapist to physically remove him and place him in the middle of the floor with no reinforcers nearby.  (This being despite the fact that my son is averse to any touch that he can\'t control.)  They then plan to extinguish the \"behavior,\" which to them is <em>non-compliance</em>, by ignoring his screams and cries and taking away any items or things he may touch while he is crying and screaming in case he might be getting any \"reinforcement\" from them.  Oh, and ignoring anything he may tearfully say to them unless he calms down first, no matter how hard he is begging for them to talk to him.  (OK that last sentence was a little colored by my choice of words, but it\'s absolutely accurate)    He is then expected to return to liking the therapist and learning his programs, getting back to a teachable state quickly with no complaints.    This is bizarre and unnatural to me, it seems much better during those tough times to teach him how to handle tough times in real life.  I also think it\'s potentially emotionally damaging to have him screaming and begging them to talk to him and them ignoring him completely.    Please help.  I appreciate all of the feedback, and I am really upset by the way this agency (and even the supervisor I trusted) and I are at odds with one another.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">i never wanted anyone to know, mostly because i never felt that he was truly autistic. i always thought that it was something medical.       we also live in a small town, and are very well known in this small town, so it was not long at all before everyone in town knew.      when he got his label removed a few years ago, the psychologist told me that i needed to move my son to a new town, as he would always be labeled by the townspeople as \"autistic\". and she was right. he will always be treated differently in this town because of that, and it makes me sick.      so i may not be the right person to say, but i regret that we ever went and got an evaluation, since his problem did end up being medical, but it was just masked as \"autism\". terresa</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Thanks everyone for the posts but alot of the ideas really can\'t work for me at this time.  My son is very young, he is only 28 months so he really doesn\'t understand much.  The connection of what I say and what he hears or understands is just not there at this time.  I know that soon we will get through this.      I usually let him stimm galore at home but I don\'t want him to eventually think that he can do that all day and that it is acceptable. He will start school later this year and I don\'t think they will let him stimm like he would like to. Trust me when I tell him to stop he doesn\'t understand.  I don\'t mind the stimming, I actually find it kind of cute but I know he can\'t do at at school.  I am just trying to get him to back off a bit so when he does go to school it won\'t be so tramatic for him.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to four great boys!!

You are bringing up a great point- the later fall-out of holding it together. I think everyone experiences this kind of thing at some point or another, ASD or NT, it\'s just that frequency, threshold and manifestations may vary.  And I assume not everyone has a choice in the matter. But I wouldn\'t mind at all if it were possible, for my ds to try and refrain from stimming through a class, then go to the sensory room or wherever and unwind. Do you think that would be something in some way detrimental, if it could be taught? (we are no where near that level of self control, but I would love to help him get it).  After all, we don\'t always go to the bathroom (pardon the analogy) whenever it strikes us, we wait for an appropriate moment, to get to a restroom etc. Maybe the same can be taught for stimming?   I am a major hair twirler (I was miserable with short hair because of that), but I don\'t do it in a meeting, I do it when I\'m alone or at home.   One of my son\'s former therapists used to work with a little girl who is currently doing well in school in mainstream without supports or mods.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I agree with what you say as do Aidan\'s ABA therapists. Perhaps your beef is with therapists who use specific approaches not ABA itself. My therapists do combine methods, they do not believe there is just one way to teach a child, and they defer to me about stimming. They have never told him to stop doing anything. Except perhaps if he yells, NO! in someone\'s face, we ask him to say ,\"no thank you\" or \"no, mama\" or \"no therapist\'s name.\" Or if he grabs something we ask him to request it. Or we may ask him to wait his turn for something. My son isn\'t asked to comply to anything I wouldn\'t expect my daughter to comply to. We actually have no compliance program in place.      <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">They should demand the respect and fair treatment that they deserve for being the wonderful individuals that they are. ABA takes that away from them. Its not about the repitition, or the redirecting, its the principle of \"you need to act this way, because if you don\'t it is not acceptable in our society\" </div>  I would argue that many agencies and therapists have interpreted that that is how ABA should be implemented or what the core objectives are but it certainly isn\'t what ABA is or has to be.   My son has never been made to feel bad and I am betting his self esteem would rival many people NT or otherwise.   I don\'t like many of the ways ABA is implemented either. I am certainly not defending that. But to make a broad assumption that every child who receives ABA is treated poorly is not the answer. For my son, ABA has helped him to let us know what he wants and needs. It helps him to understand what we and others are saying to him. It has helped him have names for things and to understand how things work and this has improved his ability to relate and decreased his frustration immensely.   <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Part of who they are is the way they act whether WE as parents like it or not, and to constantly make them feel bad for acting that way does nothing for their self esteem.</div>    I don\'t ever remember saying I didn\'t like the way my son acted. I also can\'t think of an instance of when I have made him feel bad. Nor can I think of a time when his therapists did. And I would know because I am in every session.     I just think that there are many broad generalizations made all over the place about ABA. Generalizations in either way do not benefit anyone. To procalim that ABA is the one true answer and there is only one way to do it is dangerous and harmful and untrue. To proclaim that all ABA disrespects and harms children is equally untrue and damaging. And will prevent parents from looking into something that if done properly and if it is a good fit for their child\'s learning style, could potentially make a real difference for that child and family.    Wanted to add about the reward thing. That is another thing that is blown way out of proportion. We used some incentives initially to get Aidan interested. This is not unique to ABA. Most of the time in real life, we use things to entice adults or children. Aidan\'s <em>rewards</em> are generally positive feedback, praise and loads of attention.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Kayley, 5(NT)  Aidan, 3 (PDD-NOS)</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Kayley, 5(NT)  Aidan, 3 (PDD-NOS)</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">spider,    You make a lot of good points.  Three years old is very young to expect real coordinated play between peers.  My daughter has really just started to understand the give and take of relationships, and she\'s four and a half.  In fact, the other day, she tried to initate play with another little girl at the playground.  The other girl completely ignored her despite the fact that my daughter tried on several occasions to get her attention.  The girl\'s mother told us that she was just three (big for her age) and that she really was still primarily in the parallel play phase.  It does take all children a long time to develop play skills- some longer than others. Sometimes, practicing play skills with adults and older (willing) children can be a good way to boost confidence, I\'ve found.  It\'s a safer way to learn about the give and take of friendships without the imminent threat of rejection.  This might be a good way to get your son started.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">My son just turned three, which seems to be the magic number for a lot of behavioral problems.  However, one thing I hadn\'t expected to see was the onset of anxiety.  Gabriel has always been easy-going and curious; he liked to go to new places and explore.  However, just yesterday we went to Target to pick up a few things, and I thought I\'d let the kids get some lunch there.  Now, we have gotten food there in the past, and because of this Gabriel ALWAYS expects us to get it there, so I\'ll usually spring for popcorn or a pretzel just to keep the peace.  Normally, I already have Gabriel in the shopping cart so I don\'t have to worry about him running off while I\'m ordering the food.  Yesterday, however, since we were planning on eating lunch, I just walked him into the store (maybe not such a good idea b/c he\'s been having a hard time with hand holding lately) and went over to the food area.  Gabriel would have none of it, wouldn\'t set one foot in the place.  Ultimately, we decided to eat after we finished our shopping.  But, then as soon as I got him into the cart and starting waliking through the store, he started screaming, \"Lunch, lunch!\".  I was confused at this point, and eventually got him calmed down.      We finished our shopping and went back over to the food area. This time, Gabriel still refused to go in.  My daughter was getting upset at this point, so I just picked him up.  He put his head against my chest and clung to me very tightly.  He has never, I mean never, done this before.  Then, when, we went to sit down, he refused to sit at the table, not even my lap.  Instead, he spent the entire time camped out under the table, and would not come out until we were finished.  I let it go, because my daughter wanted to eat there, and I really don\'t want her getting resentful of Gabriel for ruining all of her fun, but I was very upset on the inside.  Once I got Gabriel back into the shopping cart, he started eating his food and was fine thereafter.  What I\'m thinking is that he\'s starting to get more rigid in his behaviors.  He\'s used to being in the cart when we order food, and this time things were a little different.  However, my greatest concern is that he seemed genuinely afraid of sitting at the table, a response I have never seen in him before.  Is this the beginnings of anxiety?  If so, how should I deal with it?  If we avoid everything he\'s afraid of, will that really help in the long run?  For myself, I know that my own childhood anxiety problems could never be adequately addressed until I confronted my fears and learned how to deal with them.  Avoidance is very tempting, but it never did me any favors.  However, I was not on the spectrum, so I don\'t know if the same will be true with Gabriel.  Anyway, any advice would be greatly appreciated. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /></div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Mouseker.  Unfortunately no.  How I found out about it was that a local speech/language clinic decided to run the workshop series, they sent a notice to the local \"Regional Center\" (kinda like Early Start for California, I think) asking caseworkers to recommend families that would be willing to be committed to do the program, and then the Regional Center funded the tuition for my hubby and myself to attend.      It would be like asking is there somewhere you can find out about ABA workshops.  It\'s kinda up to the individual therapists to decide if they want to put it on or not... but I would certainly call Hanen or email them and ask for some therapists in your area who have been trained in the method.  It\'s called \"More Than Words.\"    It was the single best thing I have done along this journey to be able to work with my son.  NO joke.      Wait Mousker... are you in California?

No major meltdowns of any kind and he and I are spending a lot of quality time together. Still, a lot of changes for him to deal with. I have been on some other boards lately dealing with some other issues I\'m pretty concerned about politically. So, haven\'t been here much.     We are still doing the Yasko thing w/ Mb12 shots. I think he is doing fantastic with it, although we\'re still really only in phase I and trying to get into phase II w/ the ammonia protocol. That\'s all I\'ll say about that as I sort of keep my biomed comments to her board now.  I must say the use of RDI type techniques has worked wonderfully for him also. I SO want to get into this more, but it just costs. I\'m going to see if I can find a consultant and do the pay we we go method or something. He is just so easy to be around now, most of the time. I just hope academically he makes some strides this year.    Anyway, Joey has calmed a LOT w/ the use of this protocol, although we still face little quirks. He is going to repeat kindergarten this fall because I felt he was so young last year just starting and he didn\'t progress the way I thought he should. The school did not fight me at all on it, so that was good.     Anyway, I\'m here w/ a little more time to post now. This summer was insane for me, but I\'m done now. Just need to take the big nursing boards and start work in October!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Joey, 6 yrs., PDD-NOS  GFCF, Yasko, RDI  Did ABA for 14 mos.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Joey, 6 yrs., PDD-NOS  GFCF, Yasko, RDI  Did ABA for 14 mos.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">how old are you now?  You can still get a diagnosis as an adult. It might help you with getting services, too.   I am not sure how to answer your questions. I have four children, the oldest has ADD, anxiety and sensory issues. The next is pretty typcial. The third, our only son, has severe dyslexia. He probably has a lot in common with you (how you feel, I mean)  Our youngest is autistic.   I expect from my children the best work that *they* can do. Not compared to anyone else. I do expect them to work hard. But I don\'t have unrealistic expectations--I know my son wont understand what he reads the way others will. And he wont get most of his learning from books. So I talk his ear off.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />   Our oldest has a hard time in crowds and with noise. So I don\'t expect her to last at a family party more than two hours.   The littlest one is starting to talk. She repeats alot. But I don;t expect her to carry on a conversation. I do expect her to attempt to say \'thank you\' when I give her something, though.  I want my children to be decent peopele, even in the midst of difficulties.   Everyone has something they find difficult to do.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ ~Blessed to be called Mama by many~</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ ~Blessed to be called Mama by many~</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">It sounds like you\'re already looking at biomedical treatments, which is great!  We started the diet before getting a diagnosis, and it significantly changed what the diagnosis was going to be.  We also started DS on omega 3\'s and a couple of other supplements.      A great place to start is with the book Children with Starving Brains.  It lays out the biomedical approach really well and is a handy guide to all the supplements.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to one 4-yr-old boy, dx w/Asperger\'s</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to one 4-yr-old boy, dx w/Asperger\'s</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">A basic primer for pretend play?  Watch the opening scene in Toy Story, where Andy has little bo peep in \"peril\" and Woody saves the day.  Pretend play doesn\'t have to be realistic, just fun.  Hot Wheels go EVERYWHERE, up and down arms, couches, they fly off the couches and crash, over the dog, wherever.  They can race, and make lots of fun noises at the same time, provided by the kids and mom, of course.    Barbies do all kinds of stuff, they go shopping, they take care of babies, they change clothes, they talk to each other, they cook, they get their hair brushed and styled, they are just like moms except with bigger boobs and skinnier waists.  Dr. and Dentist Barbie give the other Barbies, animals and GI Joe their checkups.  Action figures can do ANYTHING.  Not just save the day.  They can drive Barbie\'s cars and fix the cars when they break down.  They can lasso stuffed animals and make a corral out of blocks or lincoln logs.  Action figures CAN fight the \"Bad guys\" when the bad guys are bad.  What makes them bad?  Being mean to other figures or animals.  Taking things that don\'t belong to them.  They are just plain bad.  You don\'t have to be mean to the bad guys, just put them in time-out until they can behave.  Get outside and pretend to camp.  If you have a tent, set it up for fun.  Use a fishing pole with no hook to go fishing in the baby pool.  Put the tub toys in it and catch them with a net, pretending that the whale and fish are real.  Pretend to cook your fish for dinner with your pretend \"fire\" (we use a pile of sticks for our fire.)  Pretend play can be a little stilted and artificial at first, but you get over it.  I think it\'s just a hangup that grownups have, because it\'s been so long since we did it ourselves.  Ideally, our ASD kids should be pretending and learning these skills from NT peers, but we need to give them a little kickstart--it doesn\'t come as easily or as naturally, perhaps.  Remember, even some NT kids don\'t pretend play much.  Some do, some don\'t--it has a lot to do with the personality of the child.  Let your child guide you with their own interests.  Trust me, you\'ll have as much fun as your kid--maybe more.</div>'

We\'ve considered one parent staying at home with our 3yo and the other attending church with the older child, but we want to be able to attend church as a family and if the child is ABLE to do it, why wouldn\'t you go ahead and teach that skill?  Our church does not provide any services for children, so what would you have us do?  Not attend at all and tell our older child that church is not important right now because there\'s \"plenty of time for that when they are older\"?    Sorry to come across as defensive, but in our case, had we not been INSISTANT with many things (including going to church) our son would still be sitting in his room spinning cups all day.

' <div class=\"postbody\">What does this mean for your little girl.....    It means you take ONE day at a time.    It means YOU will appreciate the little things that you would normally take for granted.    It means YOU will need to educate yourself to make her be all that she can be.    After you have educated yourself, it means YOU will have to educate your family, friends, school and strangers to prove who SHE is and it is Ok.    It means NOT putting yourself and her in situations that you know will be a disaster.    But most of all, it means God brought YOU an angel to teach everyone around her patience, love, understanding, and happiness.    I can honestly tell you that it I was so upset and scared in the beginning because I didn\'t know what I was up against.  But my daughter has changed my life for the better, and I like who I am today because of her.  She makes gains every day, and there is NO COMPARISON of what she did at 3 years old to what she can do now.  If someone told me how things would turn out, I wouldn\'t have worried so much.  But at 7, she can read, write, do simple math, swim, dance, have friends, and so far, she is in a typical classroom.  We work so hard just to keep our heads above water, but she is doing it.

Suddenly they saw neglect on their part because what child IMPROVES over the summer without school? All his scores in 4th grade went DOWN and after I had him over the summer, they went up! In 3 months he learned more than in the entire 4th grade year. We did V/V and pragmatic language as well as math work among many other things. I do believe the light bulb went off that my kid CAN learn. </div> That\'s truly exciting!  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">I proved it and I listed all we did for him too. My point is that you must get the school involved in this to take responsibility and so they know our kids can learn. Most of them think they are doing all they can and it\'s just our kids. Can you imagine if I listened to them. Bobby would be sitting still in class on meds he didn\'t need and not learning a thing. Instead, we are still holding of on meds (not sure if he ever will take them) and he is finally getting it! </div> That is music to my ears. It\'s hard cause with Gavin, he\'s got good social skills, no typical asd behaviors but some (and not all which is even more confusing for me) math concepts are so confusing to him. Part of the problem is their stupid \"Everyday math\" which is ridiculously confusing to even me.  I had a girl in high school tell me that she didn\'t understand math until she got to middle school and they used another program. She said that they taught her so many ways and she woudl confuse them with eachother. It\'s ridiculous. I\'ve told them I want Gavin learning one or two ways, that\'s it. Not five.  Then they would teach him a \'new way\' and say, \"Oh he got it so quickly. He can do it.\" Yeah, he can do it but he will forget which rule goes with which subtraction model.  It\'s beyond me why that is even a program in the elementary schools.   <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">I think that\'s why we can\'t see any major changes -because may be it\'s not quite for him. We keep doing it just in case it\'s helping in a way we can\'t see. I pretty sure his focus has improved. There has been controversy with FastForword and hopefully your talking about the same one I am. </div> Sounds like it.  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Some say it\'s way too expensive, the company is odd is selling it. You need an OT to keep tabs on it too. I\'m not the right person to recommend or not the product.

If you utilize the program correctly, I can guarantee it will help any child and the difference will be striking. </div> I am willing to try anything cause we are both frustrated.  <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">OCN doesn\'t supply word problems but you can get these online all over the place and I have many sources I can send to you.

You are awesome!!! Thank you so much! <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Our children are notorious for not being able to generalize (use something they learned in one situation and carry over to another on their own) and therefore inference (come up with a conclusion). </div> You know what\'s interesting is generalization isn\'t hard for Gavin, but inference can be.   <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">If you think about it, how can they generalize if it\'s not in their head?

Inevitably he got to the point he hated math. </div> With Gavin, he\'s got some great skills like he can add, subtract, multiply (he\'s perfect with 0, 1, 2,5, 10, -the easy ones, the other ones are definitely more challenging and he forgot many of them over the summer since I wasn\'t very good at making him practice! <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarassed\" /> ) and is just beginning to understand the division, but it\'s taking much longer than it should and he\'s doing this as he\'s still behind in other areas (which aren\'t always obvious).   <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">OCN helped me help him see concretely what a concept was doing and that\'s a more typical spec ed method teachers use but they stop there. OCN has the child say it and write it (either in the air and/or on paper) to begin bringing that idea into their head visually (like V/V). Finally, you might find yourself spending session after session without any concrete manipulatives and your visuallizing and verbalizing math (usually doing computation as welll which is the final goal).  Concrete -to- Visualizing and Verbalizing or imaging -to- computation </div> That sounds great. We have done \'some of this\' through his school but I can see how it\'s been missed in some areas.   <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Some teachers at the V/V workshop I went to asked the V/V instructor about the children they get that cannot speak well. The instructor told them to work with the children and sometimes a speech therapist can help. Do you think Gavin can speak enough to do this? In the case of OCN, there would be less descriptive language. In V/V that\'s all you do really is describe and talk a lot. </div> Yep, he talks great.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />   <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">I can send you guys some stuff that I put together for myself -word problem worksheets and other things.

Why?    I am tempted to describe just how badly my boy was doing but I won\'t because those emotions are too raw and I want to think and move forward.  However, please  take my word for it, I am just a Mom with no vested interest in anything but my little boy.  I have no intentions of writing a book, profiting in any way. I genuinely have no ulterior motives.      The tremendous progress my boy has made I owe almost exclusively to the strength of the sound advice I have gotten from this board.  There is much more good advice than there is bad here.  I have heard it here first, then  researched it as best I could and fine tuned, tweaked it on my own and have reaped the benefit of our collective experiences.  Is he still autistic you ask?  Absolutely. But I think that my case is a bit unique in that due to financial constraints, this is NOT an instance where there were so many variables that it was hard to determine the efficaciousness of so many interventions.  NO chelation, NO ABA, no DAN, NO secretin, NO MB12, NO RDI - just GFCFCFSF, antioxidants, 1:1, X excitotoxins, B complex,  Feingold, enzymes, probiotics, natural antifungals.  Just AWF mother wit and an obsessive Mom reading everything I can wrap my mind around  well into the night.  Therefore, it is personally hard for me to hear/read that the evidence is shaky on whether biomeds work or not.  They do.    Even if the research were there to fully support each and every intervention, I would still defer to the practical application of the outcome of these studies.      I can understand that due to your training you may be more skeptical, thanks for trying to keep an open mind.       HTRTC</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">John, I think if you need a second and third opinion, then go get it.  If that makes you comfortable do it.  There is nothing wrong with you being proactive about your sons health.  Early Intervention is the key.     Having said that though, I think your son is doing good.  There are some places for concern but there are also some great skills that he is displaying.  I would give anything for my 28 month old son to do some of those things. My son doesn\'t point or gesture in anyway and he is no where near understanding anything I say.  So, like I said there are concerns but I think you should just wait a bit more and see if any new skills emerge.  Also, make sure no skills are lost.  This is an important time.    Stay posted......... lots of info coming from some wonderful people.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to four great boys!!

' <div class=\"postbody\">Oh Amy!  I\'m in the EXACT same boat - you took the words right out of my mouth!  My son is 6 and still won\'t poop on the toilet either!  My husband and I are going out of our minds.  He has been trained to pee in the toilet for over a year, but he flat out REFUSES to poop on the toilet.   Sounds the same as your son - I believe he is fully in control as he goes outside or upstairs to be alone when he is going to do it.  It is usually always at the same time of day - after school - just like you said - he saves it for me!      It is so hard to watch him to catch him in action because I also have two other children to look after.  So the suggestion of withholding all of his toys wouldn\'t work for us because we have toys all over the house since we have two other children as well.  I could have him sit on that toilet all day and he will still go into his room 5 min later and do it.      Have you made any progress since your last post?  I\'m so interested in hearing if anything has worked for you!      Lisa</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Neil,  You are not alone here or anywhere for that matter. There are many families who have autism in them. In addition to Dana\'s recommendations for websites the one I would recommend the strongest is Dr. James Neubranders. He tripped on the importance of the MB12 shots for our kids. His success rate if you follow the protocols exactly as he describes it is 94%. Dr. Neubrander is in Edison NJ but many DAN docs are implementing his protocols. His website is: <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.drneubrander.com\">www.drneubrander.com</a><!-- w -->.   There is also a bio-med chat every evening.

He was pretty young at the time so he was sedated and completely asleep for the MRI. He didn\'t enjoy the sedation, but he was more upset about having his blood drawn for the other tests. We were lucky because the tests came back OK. The doctor was able to rule out some other medical conditions that he thought my son might have. My son had some symptoms that weren\'t that common to autism.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Yes, we got a plan from the Early Intervention office in an IFSP (Invidiualized Family Service Plan), but the number of hours was a joke though.  We needed more hours than they provided.   However, their staff child psychologist also provided a report with areas that needed to be strengthened, areas that were strong, and what therapy goals and methods would work best for our child.  We also got a private evaluation and that child development professional that confirmed pretty much what the EI psychologist stated in her report which was lots of Floortime plus ABA and placement in an inclusion setting with typical peers.   Now we have an IEP (Individual Education Plan) with the school district.  It also has goals, therapies, and methodology listed.  Our IEP states 2 hours of ABA each day at school.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Both of my kids receive a combination of Floortime and ABA.  When they were younger, they started w/Floortime only.  As they got older, were more motivated and could understand more, their therapists started phasing in ABA.  My oldest now gets heavy ABA w/some floortime and my youngest still receives mostly Floortime w/ABA sprinkled in at this point.      I believe what therapies are best for the child is really an individual thing.  We are fortunate that we live in an area where we can find therapists trained in both and are necessarily \"hardline\" one way or the other.    Dana R.</div>'

To my immediate sadness, they rejected ABA.  NO OFFENSE HERE...THIS IS WHAT THEIR INITIAL UNDERSTANDING WAS...AS THEY WERE TOLD...AND NOW KNOW DIFFERENTLY, I AM SURE!  Anyway, they were told the \"old\" story about the Pavlov dog training, etc. and they chose Dr. Greenspan\'s \"Floortime\".    Through the years I have read little about ABA-\"cept\" on here...since it did not apply.  Is it possible for anyone to give me a condensed version of what it really is and what it hopes to accomplish and if it is more successful for specific symptoms of ASD, etc.  I know it has done wonders for so many kids but I really don\'t understand (except accepting orders/rewards) about it.

Dr. Bradstreet is going to open a clinic, if he hasn\'t already done so, in California.     My recommendation is to always contact parents in your area.  They would know who is good and who is mediocre.  Here\'s a link to parents in your state who do biomed.

Last week he said that he would like to do the track and field program which runs for one month...I figured he\'d hate it or be bored, but agreed with lots of encouraging remarks whilst making sure that he knew he  doesn\'t have to continue if he doesn\'t like it... He\'s been doing it every day now for a week and he isn\'t tired of getting up early or missing out on recess at lunch hour, or free time after school...he seems to be really enjoying it and it\'s rained every day to boot, but he still wants to continue.  He\'s never been a popular kid at school with other boys, although he has his own set of friends, today when I dropped him off at the gym, everyone there was really friendly to him, and made a space in the middle of the bench for him to sit....could it possibly be that because he is making an effort in athletics other kids have more respect for him????

' <div class=\"postbody\">where i live there is money in EI and preschool like you would not believe. Its not always the money. Some kids do not actually benefit from inclusion with typical kids. They must be ready.     Typical kids learn social skills from adults like pointing, social smile, eye contact, etc. Then speech which is huge for socialization. Play skills, etc. Typical kids usually start pre-school at age three and wow do they have a lot of skills at that point!  These skills are really necessary for our kids too to have successful inclusion. Pre-school is a challenging place.     If anybody is out there at a point where they are considering it, then the best thing IMO is to work on goals first in 1:1 and small groups even if they are all ASD. if you can get a typical peer model thats even better. I had a really bad experience with inclusion before my son was ready. It shocked me that he did not succeed. It really was a wake-up call and i immediately moved him to a more intense program.  There he worked one by one on social goals and he is now succeeding &amp; can go to preschool without his inclusion aide if we choose to do so.       irene</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ proud mom of zachary age 3 1/2 with PDD-NOS</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ proud mom of zachary age 3 1/2 with PDD-NOS</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Respect,    We opted for a mainstream kindergarten class.  My son is the only special needs child and he has a shadow.  I don\'t think you will know for sure one way or the other until you visit each type of setting and see how things are working.  I know that my son would not do well in a segregated class.  He does pick up behaviors from other children, particularly the negative behaviors.  We have spent the past month trying to extinguish a strange type of squeal he picked up from a much older ASD boy (who is not even in his class, but the class next door).  Last year he imitated a clapping sound that another ASD child was making.  When we tried to reprimand him, we would look at us and yell the other child\'s name.  It was infuriating.      I do think that a home program is the best place to start.  We did about four months of ABA and then enrolled in a half day junior kindergarten program.  My instincts were to keep him at home for another year of full time ABA, but I listened to the experts who said that my son needed the company of other children more than he needed the ABA.  To quote our psychologist \"The world is a social place.  If he is going to learn how to swim, he has to get into the pool.\"  Well my son, learned nothing at school that year.  When I expressed some disappointment, everyone seemed truly shocked.  They said \"What do you mean.  He has learned the routine of being in school\".  Well he had that down after the first week.  Standing in line for bathroom break and getting his snack bag from the hook in the hall were not difficult for him.  I had higher expectations that would have been better met at home.  Once the requisite skills are in place though (in my opinion, that means simple language and at least a little bit of ability to attend to group instruction), I think a mainstream program is a good choice.  If the kids in a segregated class are high functioning, then circumstances might be different.  This has not been my experience though.    Just a mom</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">it\'s ok to have questions about God and his ways. None of us will ever have all the answers. He chose to not give us all the answers, which leads us to have to have faith to believe.  God is just God. He\'s bigger than us. He knows everything. He does what he wants to do. Sometimes people of faith pray for thier child, and the child is not healed. Sometimes people who don\'t have a relationship with God pray, and He heals their child. We don\'t understand it, but I tell you what happens when I pray, even if I don\'t get my prayers answered the way I want: I grow closer to God. I sense his presence. And with it comes peace that passes understanding. And joy overflowing. He is amazing.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" /> Even if he answered not one more of my prayers, I would serve Him and love Him forever.

' <div class=\"postbody\">New York, we homeschool (for now), but that has more to do with our son and SD then the services available.  It varies greatly from SD to SD, ours has GREAT services for kids with more severe disabilities, but kids like my son with ADHD (lost his diagnosis of PDD) tend to get good services until 2nd grade and then are dumped/mainstreamed without support.  This is at least what I\'ve heard from friends and neighbors, my son has never actually attended public school.  Also with the budget crunch (state and local) school budgets are being slashed.    Just a thought, what people consider &quot;good services&quot; vary greatly.  When my son was in pre-K, I wanted an inclusion class room with 10 typical kids and 5 kids with needs.  Another parent might want 1:1 ABA forty hours a week.  I know parents that fight tooth and nail for an aide and I don\'t want one for my son.  So I try to be very clear about what people consider &quot;good services&quot;.  Good luck with your search and move.</div>'

DS will accept \"let me help you\" or &#8220;let me show you&#8221; from adults when experiencing difficulty on an activity, and attend to their demonstrations of activities within his ability range (not MASTERED skills but activities requiring skills within appropriate developmental range according to _______ report, with considerations made for DS\'s specific autism-related (and sometimes unusual) areas of need/deficit), including HOH prompting when necessary.       a) DS will be re-request additional clarification if still confused, or,        b) DS will ask for validation of his attempt to perform the requested action after attempting (Did I do it right?)       c) DS will attempt the activity again, or ask to try again later.       d)        DS will advise the adult he\'d like to try again himself.    (When a group instruction is issued, the teacher must attend to DS to ensure she has been heard.  If DS does not respond in one of the aforementioned ways, antecedent data (not just immediate but prior) must be immediately recorded by the aide, there should be functional analysis of what was the root cause of his inattentiveness at that moment, and supports/modifications/(or none of those) made accordingly.  When the cause has been determined, if it is due to an area of need related to DS\'s autism and can be addressed with specific skills/replacement behaviors, those will be created, attempted, taught, and implemented.  Therefore the goal set must have some flexibility to address new replacement behaviors as they are created and taught to DS.)    When a teacher issues a group instruction within DS\'s sphere of understanding or ability (after successfully obtaining the class&#8217;s attention,) DS will do one of the following:       a) Perform/attempt to perform the requested action(s)       b) Ask for the instruction to be repeated       c) Ask for clarification        d) Ask for additional assistance    When a teacher issues a group instruction outside DS\'s current sphere of ability, DS will choose one of these strategies:       a) Ask for clarification       b) Ask for a repeat       c) Utilize the following rehearsal strategies that have been previously taught and mastered             a. _____________            b. ________________            c. _______________</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi This is my first post, My son is 18 PDD-NOS and emerging with incredible insite and knowledge I didn\'t know he had. Over the past 2 years he was very preoccupied with Driving and youth rights and having panic attacks. We tried the natural suppliments but he clearly needed something more. His mom and I never wanted to medicate him but I have to say it was the best thing for all of us. Turns out it was anxiety. Once he felt better his creativity emerged and he has started a blog. He has strong opinions i didn\'t know he was capable of because he had such a hard time communicating. I am writing for two reasons the first is to tell you that there is a lot of hope for these kids. When he was little I longed to hear from some parents that had older kids so I could understand a little more of what was comming. Secondly I want to expose his writing to you so you may understand what your kids may be capable of but not able to tell you.

But, WE did not cause your autism and you guys did not cause my bad mood so I am going to try really hard to still be nice to all of you!  It might be harder having autism, but, if you are going to try to make yourself a little \"higher functioning\", you must keep control of your emotions more, like we all do <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /> !  I am not trying to be mean...I am only trying to help you a little bit!

You are so caring about our little kids here. <img src=\"http://www.planetsmilies.com/smilies/love/love0001.gif\" alt=\"Image\" />    David, you can drink all the beer you want, but dear young man, none of your problems go away with it!  There is an old saying something like -  \"There is no problem so big that alcohol can\'t make bigger\"!  Have you, your parents, or your doctor ever suggested medication that might even out your moods a little bit.  I take an anti-depressive medication, and for my particular situation it helps....maybe something else would help you!  I feel bad when you feel badly so much of the time.

Anyhow, I would like to donate some of the $ made from the sale of my product to go towards something to do with Autism.  Do I donate to the ARI?  Do I create a fund for parents who can\'t afford a lot of the DAN treatments many of us struggle to fund ourselves (ie.

Except mine won\'t play with the others and mine won\'t laugh at the appropriate things, and mine won\'t sit!  So, like I tell me 6 year old, they go to a special school to help them to learn to talk and play like me and you.

Then he screamed out at the \"tweet-tweets\" (birds), then he screamed at the puddles, then he screamed at the waves again.  He absolutely LOVED it!  At this point we were wishing we had gone earlier in the day.  As it was, we only got about 30 minutes at the beach before going to stroll the boardwalk, and it was already starting to get chilly -- and the water was FREEEEEEEZING!!      So anyway, we left the beach, changed Little Man back into dry clothes and a diaper and started to stroll the boardwalk.  All was well initially until the crowd parted enough for him to see the ocean again.  He wanted to go back there - and he wanted it BAD! LOL  At one point, we had the brilliant idea of letting him out of his stroller in the arcade just to see what he\'d do and let him push buttons on the machines, etc.  Well, apparently that was a bit much for him and for the first time ever he actually covered his ears before he started running out... and then he spotted the ocean and started running recklessly through the sea of people, headed back to the \"Water in the Ocean\" where all the \"tweet-tweets\" were!  Hubby snatched him up just before he ran off the boardwalk.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" />     But, all in all, it was very cute to see how much he loved the beach and he was excited enough about the sights that his sand munching was minimal.   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" />   So, we are planning to go back and stay a night within the next week or two.

' <div class=\"postbody\">LM:  I have seen VB-only graduates who look \"normal\", and for some lucky ones, things just sort of \"click\", once you jump-start them with ABA. They may still have residual deficits, or do poorly in more unusual circumstances, I don\'t know, but to me, they looked just fine.  For others, like my son, there are fewer freebies, and most gaps just don\'t fill in by themselves.     What has PRT done for your son and how is it different than VB applied in the natural environment (this was the mainstay of our intervention with Alex) ?    One important thing that RDI has done for me, is that it has finally explained to me what was wrong with my son. And even though it was a knife in the heart when Gutstein said \"people with autism have no minds\" (I still resent that !), it helped me understand that autism isn\'t just a collection of deficits plus a variable amount of weird stuff that we need to remedy/get rid of (which used to be my take on the subject), but it is more like an information processing disorder. So treating it behaviorally only, may not always help their processing abilities. As soon as I was able to test this with my son I realized he was right. My son has enough functional language now, to give me a window to see how/when his brain works, and most of his thinking is static, concrete, one-track. He can add, read and figure our computer games, but he can not sustain the simplest back-and -forth interaction with a peer.    I wish I was better at RDI than I am, but I can tell you that one of the nice things about this is that you can do as much or as little as you can or feel comfortable with. There is very little pressure in the way of hours, data etc compared with a standard ABA program.    Alex\'s mom</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Dear Scottish Lassie - I will still stick to my original advice.  There is no way I would make my son go to swimming class when it is causing panic attacks etc.  If necessary, take this \"fight\" all the way to the top.  In the U.S. the top person in a school district is the Superintendent.  I don\'t know what that tittle would be over there.    I would explain that my son has more than enough problems with life and school and that swimming is the least of your concerns. Tell them you are not going to add to them by making him go to swimming!!!!  Stand firm!!!  I can imagine the little boy\'s terror and it is wrong to put him through that.  You said he before he likes to swim with family so he is learning...and if he doesn\'t learn swimming...that is your business and not the schools!!!!  As a person who used to suffer panic attacks many years ago, I can tell you they are the very worst thing you can personally experience!! To combine them with autism has to be pure hell <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /> ! !  Good Luck,      Grandma C</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Linda,  Working for an hour right in the begining is amazing. If Dom was resistant after an hour they, IMO, should have taken his cue and done some play breaks. We have never found a need to work at a table and Aidan has breezed through a million programs. I\'m not saying that they shouldn\'t work at a table just that for certain a whole session at the table seems grossly inappropriate for a young child and I cannot imagine he will think they are too fun if that is the way sessions start off. As BTDT mentioned, they definitely need to pair themselves with fun, especially in the beginning.     I think your ideas are right on. I would also provide them with a list of activities and play that Dom really enjoys so that they can begin to incorporate them into his sessions. We also had great success incorporating some sensory activities during the mid way point (1 hour). I also think it is a bad idea to wait till he is in distress to take breaks - but they should know that.     Let us know how your talk goes.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Kayley, 5(NT)  Aidan, 3 (PDD-NOS)</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Kayley, 5(NT)  Aidan, 3 (PDD-NOS)</div>'

I think we spent about $100 total, but it was money well spent.     My guy had just started a new daycare at the time, and he was 3.5.  The daycare was very supportive.  We basically lived in the bathroom for 2 weeks, even moved a TV in there, but (knock on wood and praise God), he did it, and he has not had any accidents.      And the daycare charged an extra $50 per week since he was older and needed training, so that was a huge incentive.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I was still alittle freaked out about it when I posted yesterday and didn\'t give any details of what happened.....here goes.  I went with Luke to Dom\'s school to collect him, it was a lovely afternoon and Luke loves to scooter, so we scooter\'d to school, but when we got to Dom\'s classroom and were waiting outside, I look into the classroom to find Dom and then Luke takes off on me, I find him at the front of the school being held by the principal because there are lots of cars at the front for pick up, it\'s really dangerous, he could have gotten run over, he\'s never done it before, he usually stays at the back on the few occassions we scooter there.   I bring him back and take away the scooter and say he can play on the playground at the back with Dom....he does so, then Dom is talking to me and pointing to something back at his classroom, I avert my eyes from Luke playing and follow what Dom is showing me, we exchange a few words, I look up and I can\'t see Luke in the play area, I do the sweep of the area with my eyes, but still can\'t see him, the clock is ticking as I realise that Luke is gone AGAIN.....I get on the other scooter to go search for him fast and realise that one of the scooters is gone too....I figure he has gone round the front again, so head over there, he\'s not there, I tell the principal to keep an eye out for him and give him a description, the clock is ticking, what is it 3 minutes now since I\'ve seen him......I try to think about where I would go if I was Luke...I suddenly realise that he would go see the garbage dumpster in the parking lot and head over there, of course he\'s there reading the sign on the dumpster, happy as a lark....all is well, but I am still alittle freaked by it, anyone could have taken him, he would not have understood, no-one would have thought his screaming was anything more than a naughty kid being dragged off by an angry parent.....  I\'ve never experienced this before, lucky I found him, but I\'m just so scared to turn my back on him now....he\'s never been known to do this before...

' <div class=\"postbody\">I visited your website and Youtube video on empathy. That is a topic that is important to me, and I found it very helpful to listen to your story about how you learned to feel empathy.  My son (preteen) responds inappropriately to other people\'s emotions. For example, he will laugh when someone is upset. He doesn\'t think someone should feel sad or angry with him if he didn\'t <em><strong>intend</strong></em> to hurt their feelings.  He doesn\'t always &quot;put himself in another\'s shoes.&quot; For example, even though he hates it when someone stares at him, he likes to stare at other people, and he doesn\'t think they should mind it.  On the other hand, he feels empathy for people who are less fortunate. He goes out of his way to collect food and goods for the homeless. He\'s also compassionate toward animals.  I think he finds it easier to feel empathy when social conventions aren\'t involved. Does that make sense?</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ â€œThe seeking is the goal and the search is the answerâ€</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ aThe seeking is the goal and the search is the answera</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">If you have any conditions in your family for which there are genetic tests available (like for example cystic fibrosis, Down\'s syndrome, etc etc etc) the counselor provides you with a risk assessment for future kids. For a family who only has one child with autism who tested negative on genetic tests (like fragile X) I\'m not sure it\'s that valuable to see a genetic counselor.  They may tell you what you already know, that there is a somewhat increased risk in siblings as well ( I read anywhere from 5 to 10%).   They also make you see a genetic counselor beforehand,  if you are planning an amniocentesis with a future pregnancy.   HTH  Alex\'s mom</div>'

She never offers us any money to help us pay for all these therapies that will hopefully recover him so he won\'t need special care when he\'s older - ugh!!!

But since your son has actually made a list he\'ll be more aware than mine was.  I was (and still am) careful about my older child, who is aware like yours, that if someone just doesn\'t respond, I lie and say they were sick or not in town.    Could you have it somewhere where the <em>location </em>is the draw?  Like a Chuck E Cheese type place?  (Do they have those in AZ?  Those pizza places with tons of video games and dressed up characters.)  If the place is wild and crazy enough then he might not notice much more, especially if there are lots of voices singing, adult or child.    Could you have 2 parties... one at the school, where every kid basically has to be there, complete with goody bags, pizza, whatever... and then the \"real\" party somewhere fabulous?  Or with something fabulous at your home, or whatever?  Then everyone on his list will have come to \"his #1 party\" and certain kids to \"his #2 party?\"  But every kid on the list will have come to A PARTY (at least in his mind?)    I guess my advice is to make the party so overwhelming and sensory-overloading that he won\'t notice who is and isn\'t there.  Think it would work? <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" /></div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">taking a break from being \"Mom\'s Taxi\" myself to check in...    Seriously, you guys have so many amazing points I just don\'t know what to highlight first.   I really can\'t keep it all in my head, LOL.    So I\'ll just keep rambling  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Embarassed\" /> and say the next thing that\'s coming up in my head to anyone who is still awake... that ABA does not have to become obsolete as a child ages, but in practice, that\'s what\'s happening.  If you can mesh ABA principles with an educated understanding of a child\'s individuality as well as developmental stages... INCLUDING increased desire for independence as a child ages... then it should continue to be helpful and effective.    It seems like so many therapists get stuck in toddler mode and don\'t get it that they have to adjust for an older child.  Or maybe not toddler mode, but beginning ABA mode.  As the skills are learned, though, MOVE ON.      I\'m thinking in particular of a funcitonal analysis of behavior.  Why a 2 year-old will avoid going to the potty is going to be very different than if all of the sudden a 5 year-old starts refusing, but the ABA answer seems to be the same for both, rewards and aversives.  In neither case is it really examined WHY the kid doesn\'t want to go to the potty.  Except probably by Jen\'s team, who sound like angels on earth (and I\'m pretty sure that MOAA, wherever she may be, has a great program and team as well.)    Recently my kiddo had a potty regression and started peeing all over the house like a cat.  Immediately we were supposed to start back up with having him try to go every half hour, keeping a chart, etc., etc.  This made no sense to me, as this is what we did a year ago, and he\'s a more mature child now.  A year ago he didn\'t know what to do, so this approach made sense, but now there\'s something else at play, so why automatically address it the same way?  Turns out it probably had something to do with an upper respiratory infection (go figure, not clear how that makes sense, but evidently it\'s common) and once I rectified the URI, the potty problems got better, too.    Yesterday the woman who is also a supervisor but is on our case as a therapist stated she does not feel DS is using stim as any sort of outlet for anxiety.  She did not feel DS HAD anxiety, as she did not see it herself.  What bothered me is how someone with a B.A. in psychology and a couple of years behavioral training can presume to know the inner psychological state of a small child.    It\'s not just, I don\'t know, \"mean,\" it seems to me <em>to undermine the effectiveness of the therapy</em> to assume one knows the function of a behavior without really, really examining it closely and questioning constantly... like an assembly line formula vs. an individualized one.  I think ABA NEEDS to question reasons behind behaviors in order to even do what it purports to do, and to do it most effectively.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Wolf\'s Rain and jend - thanks for your responses,    Jend, your \"I\" responses just opened another can of worms for me - as I think there is some disagreement among tutors here in our program as to what an independent response is.  What I think of as correct vs independent is: J does <em>not </em>get an \"I\" if he gets a correct response after a series of prompted trials.  He gets an \"I\" if the target was re-presented in a seperate sitting and he got it correct.  Which is a whole other data integrity issue in itself.  Wolf\'s Rain?      I think this also ties into cold probing because if you\'re only doing 1st and last probes of the day, how do you know that the last Y or + of the day was not after a series of prompted trials?     We were previously taking trialxtrial data and I really felt like 1) it was affecting the momentum of the session and 2) I couldn\'t trust it.  Some targets he gets in a couple trials, others several consecutuve trials- to remember the level of prompting and what targets required what prompting - especially if you\'re interspersing programs - it makes my head spin  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" /></div>'

Then gently unroll.  My son cannot get enough of this!  This is how we taught him to sign \"more blanket\".

' <div class=\"postbody\">That is appalling, why would the bus company and school authorities have someone driving the special needs bus who has no toleration for special needs children.  In hindsight I guess you could have knocked on the door of the bus to make sure he knew you saw him... I wonder if the other kids on the bus at the time have verbal skills and could clarify what you witnessed, I am sure they can\'t all be non verbal, unless that child was the last one left on the bus of course?  There are still too many people in society who have no empathy for our special needs population, we have all experienced their inflexibility and judgemental comments, it\'s disgusting.  Yesterday we were at our local school playground helping Luke to practice his new 2 wheeler bike skills, Luke is very fearful of dogs, and we suddenly see this huge dog coming towards him, no leash, he was so big from a distance I thought it might be a coyote....the owner was at least 10 paces behind the dog, my husband who was running along the side of Luke\'s bike asked the dog owner to put it on a leash, and she told him to \"get a life!\"....I was about to burst so I cut in and said \"My husband is concerned because our child has autism, and he is scared of big dogs\"..she said \"Well my dog wouldn\'t hurt him\", I replied \"But my special needs son does not know your dog won\'t hurt him does he..\", she got ruder and ruder and told us to [expletive] off, and go to our own neighbourhood, even though that is our neighbourhood......Why do we need to explain our reasoning for asking a dog owner to leash their dog, there are lots of off leash parks, I don\'t get it, and I am certain we all encounter these confrontations on an almost daily basis....

That will come with age. I like the ideas though! Thanks a bunch!   Shilo  oh, I noticed you give Berry Keen. I do too:-) My kids will only take that one. I also give them Behavior Balance. It works well for both of them. I ran out once (bad mommy) and could not get more for a couple of days. My son had his first bad tantrum since I started him on it. It was an all day event. That convinced me of how valuable it is to him. If you are interested let me know. I know where you can get it at a good price.  Shilo</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I have been reading through your postings and I thought you may want the point of view from someone in the field. I have been working on home and school-based ABA programs for about 8 years. The one thing that stands out to me most is the lack of creativity and fun in learning of many ABA programs.     Staff should constantly be looking at how to make the sessions more fun and entertaining. Materials should be bright and colorful and contain characters and themes that interest your child. Utilizing effective teaching materials will only make sessions more productive and result in more efficient learning. Staff will still be following the guiding principles of ABA.     There are tons of variations of token boards that can be used to help structure his time, yet have a novel effect still.     I am more than happy to give some suggestions as to what materials I have designed that have been effective. Feel free to send me an email and we can discuss a few ideas.     Remember you are the best advocate for your child. You are going above and beyond allowing people to come into your home on a regular basis. Those people should be dedicated to your child and your family.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Well, Sad to say Claritin wasn\'t kind to my son either. I gave him the dose yesterday at 4pm. All was ok up untill about 11am today. In the span of about an hour my son who normally isn\'t aggressive or mean turned into  little hellion. I was smacked in the face, head butted in the chest, kicked, bit and screamed at for about an hour. My son usually doesn\'t have meltdowns, he has \"happy tantrums\" (for those who don\'t know what these are they are over stimulation to the point of extreme giggling, spinning, throwing things up in the air and yelling \"whee\") Today we had a meltdown, not unlike the one back in October when he was taking Zyrtec and that one came about the same time after the first dose as this one. I guess Claritin and Zyrtec are on the list of what my son can\'t tolerate. Back to the good ol\' Benadryl for us.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I love places where we don\'t feel unwelcome.  You must have been so proud of your little guy!  My 10 year old has aspergers and has on his own become a little politician.  Everywhere we go he warns parents with babies about the dangers of mercury and vaccines.  I gave a speech at a college a few months ago and he came with me and gave his own little speech about his autistic brother and told the students that there is hope for children with autism and to never give up.  He always makes me want to cry, and I haven\'t figured out if its because he makes me proud or if its because I feel guilty that he can\'t just be 10.  Maybe its a little bit of both.  Maybe we all have activists and politicians just itching to get out there and change some things.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Respect,  It\'s more than the big dog or red dog. Take that dog and put it in a story/book and read the book to your child then ask \"what was the story about?\" Most likely our kids give a specific incident in the story (an in our case it was almost word for word -remembering text). They can see perfectly a red dog -that\'s fact. Can they understand a story line and tell it to someone else. Not likely unless we work with them. If you can\'t read and tell someone what you read, how can you move forward and inference?    You don\'t have to purchase a special program to at least begin to work on this. Try this: go to a movie (cartoons at the theater are perfect) and then read the book to the movie. This helps them visualize the story line and is GREAT practice for their brain. Also, try to ask questions after a sentence or even a few words to get them to visualize and remember it.     b\'s mom</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ B, 10, AS  LMB Bell V/V &amp; OCN, pragmatic lang, fiber, vits, avoid gluten, Nord Nat omega 3-6-9.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ B, 10, AS  LMB Bell V/V  OCN, pragmatic lang, fiber, vits, avoid gluten, Nord Nat omega 3-6-9.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Dear All,     1. I\'m very new to this forum. I\'ve a son of 23 Months old. After reading the red symptoms of this site, I think he has got autism.     a.  He walks on his toes, he doesn\'t respond if he is called with his name. To be more precise sometimes he respond some times he doesnot. It is fully dependent on his desire.     b.  But he has got some tv ad.s and some cartoon cds like animal alphabet of his own choice. Once he hears the sound even he is not in the room, he comes running and starts dancing, while he watches them. Even if he hears the lyrics from his mom, he jumps into her.    c.  He has got some poetrys of his own choice, once he hears them for his mon, he jumps into her and starts adouring her. He likes the bouncy ball of msn messenger very much. If he sees that he come near me and climb up to my lap in the chair and try to use the mouse of the computer.     2. Above all are the activities he does. About meal he like dry food very much. He is living on noodles and some time a small amount of milk thats all. He likes only orange juice and banana. He does not accept any thing else.     3. Please suggest me what should I do with him. I\'m married only 4 years and we are very happy couple.     4. I\'ll be very greatful to you all.

I looked for a cd clock and got one, and this is day 4 and my son has been up and ready for school in 15 minutes, where it would take him 1 1/2 at times.

He\'s been on 15 meds...nothing helped!    So last year my Husband showed him some horror movies(I was NOT happy) well..now my son is fixated on this stuff...he says he thinks about them all the time...that the movies are talking to him. his concentration is horrible..he\'s spacey.. he laughs at nothing, very much in his own world.  he does not see the movies  anymore!!He also waves his hand at nothing??I keep telling him to STOP thinking about those stupid movies!

' <div class=\"postbody\">I actually have never posted my suspicions on a public forum because I am infinitely aware that they are not truths just instinct - but since we are in advice/support and not media/politics I will answer with the disclaimer that this is purely opinion.    My thinking is that Aidan just had a bad timing of things that if not in the combination that he received them and without his very individual make up - he may have been fine. Again, I insert this is just the musings of a mom - no fact based evidence.    Aidan received the flu shot 1 month before he received his MMR and varicella vaccine. At the same time, he was introduced to tuna fish - which he loved!!! I was happy that he liked \"brain food\" as opposed to nuggets &amp; mac &amp; cheese so I was happy to give him tuna at least once a week. Though something unconsidered at the time was that when Aidan ate tuna, I did too and he was nursing. I wonder, if it was all just bad timing of a lot of things being introduced at the same time and maybe too much of everything for a little guy who may have had some predisposed gut/excretion issues. Also, purely as a side note, I am rh- and did receive the rhogam shot both in utero and after birth as I did with my first. I just think sometimes was it just a complex combination of various things that if any given element was taken out a different result would have happened.    One last thing of potential interest. Aidan has a first cousin on my husband\'s side that is 4 months older. It is a very interesting situation. his parents were worried about speech delay at a time when Aidan was doing fine. Then at his 2nd b-day it seemed he kind of caught up. Now at 3 and a half they are in this kind of limbo place and kind of scared. See, his language is fine, but in everyday life you can see it\'s not where his peers are, he can play with peers but has to take a very long time to warm up, he also seems to be somewhat sensory defensive. It is the weirdest situation, because if Aidan didn\'t have what he had and I wasn\'t so hyper sensitive to these issues, I would probably think they were just competitive parents for even being concerned. But Anthony is one of those children that for right now, looks like autism-ultra light. And Anthony never ate tuna, had no rhogam, no flu shot. I know it\'s not scientific but I often wonder, if he had would his characteristics be more obvious and more similar to my son\'s?</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Kayley, 5(NT)  Aidan, 3 (PDD-NOS)</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Kayley, 5(NT)  Aidan, 3 (PDD-NOS)</div>'

Luke is just now starting to do most of these things but he still can\'t stick out his tongue.  I\'ve been working with him for a long time.  He\'s just recently started blowing a harmonica and a noise maker and drinking out of a straw so I\'m sure the other things will happen eventually.  Patience is definately a virtue    <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />    If you can get a ST trained in PROMPTS therapy, they\'re one of the best to work with apraxic kids since they use the oral motor approach to speech and not just the phonological approach.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Mom, I really don\'t want to offend you here, but I want to caution you about giving advice for things like this. I agree with you, that minerals can cause clentching (I worked in a health food store for YEARS before working with austistic children), but some of these non water soluable things can be harmful. Moreso, calcium, magnesium, and potassium can reduce clentching due to mineral defencienes because they are smooth muscle relaxants. However, vit C etc, is not a mineral but a vitamin. GABA, the amino acid, is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. This is something that should be reviewed extremely carefully when giving to children, and under strict medical monitoring. It may work wonders for your child, and I support the use in him, but we can\'t assume that for everyone.     Especially given that very frequently, autistic children have bio medical absorbancy problems, extreme food allergies, and mineral processing disorders. Not every autistic child has this, but also not every autistic child can have the same needs, or dosages as others. Just because it\'s natural, does not mean it\'s safe for everyone.     I think your feedback is very helpful, and accurate, and agree that those substances you mentioned can be helpful for the things we\'re talking about. We don\'t however, know the chemistry of her child, nor do we really know what is going on to cause those problems.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Reality is that in which when you stop believing it, it doesn\'t go away.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Reality is that in which when you stop believing it, it doesn\'t go away.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Kids in the Syndrome Mix of ADHD, LD, Asperger\'s, Tourette\'s, Bipolar, and More!  The one stop guide for parents, teachers, and other professionals  Martin L. Kutscher MD  With a contribution from Tony Attwood  With a contribution from Robert R Wolff MD  Hardback, ISBN-10: 1-84310-810-0 ISBN-13: 9781843108108, 224pp, 2005, Â£14.99, $19.95    BIC: VFK JDGS JDB       description extract contents    Chapter 1    Read this Chapter! General Principles of Diagnosis    â€œWhy am I reading a chapter on making a diagnosis?  I\'m not a doctor.â€    The â€œsyndrome mixâ€    Start with a real, live childâ€”a kid with feelings, needs, and hopes. Mix in a double helping of attention defict hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a touch of Tourette\'s, and a dash of dysgraphia. Stir gently. That is one possible â€œsyndrome mixâ€ that a child, parent, teacher, and other professionals may be dealt. That\'s what they have to deal with.    Who says that kids have just one problem? Multiple issues often cluster together in any combination. Common members of the syndrome mix include:    ADHD    learning disability    autistic spectrum disorder, such as Asperger\'s syndrome    sensory integration dysfunction    anxiety/obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)    Tourette\'s syndrome    depression    bipolar depression    oppositional defiant disorder    central auditory processing disorder.    If a child has any one of the problems out of the syndrome mix, then there is a very significant chance of one or more of the other problems occuring.    Not only does the same child tend to be born with multiple issues, but the issues also may exacerbate each other. For example, a child may innately have both ADHD and learning disabilities; but then the poor attention span makes it harder to learn, while the difficulty learning makes it harder to concentrate. The mix of syndromes keeps exacerbating itself.    Similarly, the problems can imitate each other. For example, a child constantly mulling over her anxieties can look distracted, and this behaviour can be confused with ADHD.    In addition, often the stressed child will find himself in a stressed home or school environment. True, that stressful environment may have been caused by the youngster, but the end result is that the child now finds himself having to deal with stressed-out adultsâ€”the last ingredient the child needs!    Also, many of the neuropsychiatric conditions run in families. Thus, the child may find him/herself coping with parents (and teachers/therapists?) with their own inborn problems.    For each area of difficulty, there is a gradient of severity. We need to separate whether it is a â€œproblemâ€ (i.e., significantly impacts the quality of a child\'s life and merits significant intervention) or a â€œquirkâ€ (i.e., an unusual feature causing less impairment). Even if an issue does not rise to criteria for a â€œproblemâ€ status, it might still benefit from being addressed. Dr. John Ratey, a noted psychiatrist, refers to these low-grade issues as â€œshadow syndromesâ€ (Ratey and Johnson 1998).    One reason, then, that parents and teachers may have trouble figuring out what the problem is that there is typically more than one, each occurring with its own degree of intensity.    First signs    When you think about it, psychologists, therapists, neurologists and psychiatrists do not stand on the street corner and randomly pick children to evaluate. Rather, the kids are all sent there because other people have noticed a problem. Those people are the ones on the frontline: the teachers and the parents. They may not know what the problem is, but these caregivers are the first to diagnose that there is a problem. Like it or not, the whole system depends on these first-responders. This chapter will help you feel more comfortable filling the role you have already been given.    No child\'s problem is diagnosed on the basis of one piece of information. Over time, multiple observers all become increasingly aware that there is some problem. The concerns typically brew over several years, until someone finally gets sufficiently frustrated to say, â€œHey, there\'s a pattern here. Something is up!â€ What observations, then, typically lead to a diagnosis?    Parents\' observations    No one knows his or her child like the parents. Mothers typically have nagging (or sometimes blatant) concerns long before anyone else will listen. They are the ones who keep seeing and hearing the same things. They are the ones with whom the child confides. They typically bear the brunt of the child\'s frustrations.    If a parent sees that something is wrong, they are typically right. After all, most parents are not interested in â€œmaking upâ€ problems for their children. Would a parent schedule a school meeting or a doctor\'s appointment just for the experience of falsely declaring to the world that their child is not thriving? No, if a parent is concerned, then there is usually an issue. That is not to say, though, that the parents have necessarily correctly identified what the problem is, or who is responsible to fix itâ€”just that there is a problem.    Teachers\' observations    Teachers are incredibly valuable in the identification of a child\'s difficulties, for multiple reasons.    They spend a great deal of time with the child, second only to the parents.    They have had contact with many other children over time, helping them to establish a basis of â€œtypical.â€    They have ongoing typical â€œcontrolâ€ children in the class. They can see which child is different from all of the other kids in the same classroom.    If a teacher is experiencing a problem with a child, then, by definition, there is a problem.    When report card comments are read in sequence, there is usually significant conformity over the years. This pattern attests that the difficulty is with a particular child, rather than a particular teacher/student match.    In order to find the teachers\' concerns, though, we must be aware that the issues are frequently masked underneath otherwise positive comments. Especially if the child is perceived as kind, cute, smart, or hard working, then the instructor tries not to be too negative. For example, he might say, â€œJill can do such amazing work when she puts her mind to it!â€ On the surface, it\'s a positive comment about Jill\'s intelligence. The subtext, though, is that Jill is not always on task.    In addition to written comments, checklists can also be helpful. Anyone can use the Behavior Checklist (see Appendix 1). For ADHD evaluations, guidance counselors or the doctor can provide a similar quick-rating scale.    So, here are the take-home messages for teachers:    Although the teacher\'s role may not be to make a specific diagnosis, their input is key to the process. Teacher feedback is the basis for diagnosing any school related problem.    Detailed written teacher comments allow for â€œhidden messagesâ€ to come through, and provide the doctor with objective information. Comments may be supplemented with check-off forms.    When a teacher identifies a problem, there usually is one. The teacher may be less accurate, though, at identifying the true underlying cause of the difficulty.    Teachers might seek the guidance of their school professionals (psychologists, guidance counselors, etc.) before broaching to the parents the idea of seeking a doctor\'s guidance.    Common pitfalls    If you find yourself saying any of the following, be very cautious. They are red flags of misinterpreting the child\'s behaviors.    â€œHe\'s lazy.â€ You\'ll notice that â€œLazyâ€ is not listed in this or any textbook as a possible diagnosis. I\'ve yet to meet a child who woke up one morning and had the following silent conversation: â€œHmm. I wonder if I should try my best today, get good grades, and be praised? Or, maybe I should deliberately blow off my work and get punished? Oh, the latter choice should be fun!â€ Yes, by the time an undiagnosed teen gets to high school, the child may indeed have been beaten down so often that he has given up. However, if we look back over the person\'s history, we usually find a young child bouncing with energy. Somewhere along the way, he\'s learned to give up.    â€œHe\'s so unprepared. He obviously does not care.â€ As we will see later, disorganization is a major part of ADHD and executive dysfunction.    â€œShe only does it when she is interested.â€ All of us do better when we are interested. The question is, â€œWhat is going on that she can\'t do it at all unless the task is totally intriguing?â€    â€œShe\'d be better at it if she just showed more interest.â€ No, it\'s probably the other way around, i.e., she\'d be more interested in it if she were better at it. A child who is a poor reader will avoid the task. I doubt she ever said to herself, â€œLet\'s avoid reading until I get really bad at it.â€    â€œHe is inconsistent. I\'ve seen him do it, sometimes.â€ Just because a child has occasionally done something right does not mean we should hold it against him or her forever.    â€œShe is just a social butterfly.â€ Boys tend to be labeled â€œhyper,â€ whereas girls get called â€œsocial.â€ True, it may be developmentally appropriate to be social; but is the girl really more interested in what her friend ate for breakfast than in learning her schoolwork, or is there some other problem? Inattentive ADHD (especially in girls) is harder to diagnoseâ€” but no less realâ€”than ADHD with hyperactivity-impulsivity.    â€œI don\'t know if there is a problem. I\'m just the teacher/parent.â€ As we\'ve seen, there is no one else like the teacher and parent to identify the child who is having some problem.    Formal evaluation    Psycho-educational testing    If the need for potential significant intervention arises, eventually the child might be given a â€œpsycho-educational evaluation.â€ This consists of a detailed series of tests:    Psychological tests (indicating a child\'s potential), such as the WISC-R (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children â€“ Revisedâ€”commonly referred to as the â€œIQâ€ (intelligence quotient) test).    Educational tests (indicating a child\'s academic achievement), such as the Woodcock-Johnson or WIAT (Wechsler Individual Achievement Test).    The report prepared by the tester usually includes an explanation of these tests and their significance. A full child study team evaluation may also include reports from social work, speech and language, occupational therapy (for fine motor, handwriting, and sensory integration), physical therapy (for gross motor), neurology, or psychiatry. Anyoneâ€”parent or teacherâ€”can request an evaluation by the school district\'s team, which should be done in a timely fashion.    The medical doctor\'s evaluation    So, what happens if the child gets sent to the medical doctor to be diagnosed? Nothing magical happens there that allows us to observe things not noted by parents and teachers over the years. In fact, the medical office is a poor place to observe a child\'s natural behavior. Let\'s take the case of a child presenting for an ADHD evaluation. One of the treatments for ADHD is a structured one-to-one situation with frequent, novel stimuliâ€”just what occurs in the doctor\'s office. Thus, trying to make the diagnosis of ADHD is difficult while the child is in what should be a therapeutic setting. This is a point of confusion for many professionals, leading to the all too frequent, â€œI don\'t see anything wrong with your child.â€ In addition, many problems such as poor foresight and organization need the laboratory of actual life over many months to be detected. Only Â­caregivers outside of the doctor\'s office can make such long-term observations.    So what do experienced doctors do? In addition to their own observations, they rely on real-world observations by those people who care extensively for the child: the parents and the teachers. In other words, we talk to the kids; but mostly we talk to the parents, read the teacher reports, and read any testing that has been done. We try to fit all of the years of observed information into a pattern, and derive one or more diagnoses. If the medical/neurological history and physical exam suggest the need, we may sometimes perform blood tests, electroencephalograms, etc.    Choosing appropriate accommodations    Armed with all of the data, everyone gets together for the big day: teachers, guidance counselors, school evaluators, administration, and parents. This team hopefully reaches an accord as to the appropriate diagnosis and treatments.    Each country and state has its own set of laws regarding appropriate formal accommodations, and readers are advised to discuss these procedures with their local school program director. Readers in the U.S. can find accurate information about terms such as â€œ504â€ and â€œIDEAâ€ at the website of the National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities at <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.nichcy.org/resources/laws2.htm\">www.nichcy.org/resources/laws2.htm</a><!-- w -->. North American readers can find local resources at <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.ldonline.org\">www.ldonline.org</a><!-- w -->.    This book, though, focuses on common sense accommodations. These accommodations are not necessarily â€œmandated,â€ but can be implemented by an appropriately helpful teacher/school. Many of them would be helpful to all students, not just those with special needs. Common sense accommodations might include educating teachers about the child\'s diagnosis, checking that the child really understands directions, preferential seating, etc.    Summary    The goal of helping each child to achieve his or her potential requires the cooperation and respect of the parents, teachers, and school administrators. Parents and teachers typically have quite good insight into detecting, over time, that there is some problem. In order to determine which problem(s) exist, the diagnostician depends upon the observations of those people who devote so much of their time to the children. Sorting out the syndrome mix can be difficult, since multiple problems can be born into the same child, can mimic each other, and can worsen each other.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to 15 year old with Early Infantile Autism, Inattentive ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Anxiety Disorder</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to 15 year old with Early Infantile Autism, Inattentive ADHD, Dysgraphia, and Anxiety Disorder</div>'

I think as a parent I have to take care to be mindful of the goal at hand so as not to reinforce avoidance.  While I also feel it\'s very important to acknowledge any attempt to communicate, my guy (and many others I\'m sure) are quick to learn that communication is the key to getting out of a task, which is good on one hand (and how it works in the real world, even w/ typically developing kids) but not so good if it is keeping him from pushing through and growing.     I also find that as a mom I tend to always question \"why\" -- why is he trying to avoid this task today? Is it because he\'s frustrated, tired, bored?  And while I think it\'s important to know the why on some level, I guess in the big bad real world, life doesn\'t just pause or step aside for us all the time, regardless of why we wish it would.   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" alt=\":|\" title=\"Neutral\" />   It can be tricky at times to know when to hold \'em, know when to walk away, and know when to run... <img src=\"http://www.planetsmilies.com/smilies/character/character0069.gif\" alt=\"Image\" /></div>'

We have never seen the boy when he was 2-3 years old. We have never seen the official diagnosis.

I don\'t know why people would lie about something like this, but people do..    The same thing with that basketball player\'s story. The media kept saying he was autistic but then he turned out to have mild aspergers.

' <div class=\"postbody\">We have done some basic signs with my son. What seems to have worked well with us is to always pair the sign with the word. So even when he would sign \"please\" we would have him attempt an approximation at the word. This has worked well for us because he was able to keep practicing a word while still being understood. Now, when he is confident with saying a word, he drops the sign. I don\'t know if this would be the advice given for every child. It worked well this way with my child because he has difficulty with articulation (he\'s 28 months). One thing for sure is that it decreased frustration and gave him some real confidence when he realized he could be understood and get his needs met quickly.

It\'s happened to us, too, at similar places.  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" />     We were so lucky at our preschool where the kids just embraced Joey - but it was their mothers that were the ones to exclude him from playdates, parties, etc. You\'re sometimes dealing with one or the other, but I\'d rather it be the parents - at least I could shield him from that.    Joey has just about one friend right now. He\'s a year younger, and he\'s very wild and naughty, but he\'s loving to him. He hugs him goodbye, screams his name when he sees him, etc. - I let them play because that\'s good for him to know someone likes him. Sometimes he picks up bad habits from him, though . ..it\'s a double edged sword.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Joey, 6 yrs., PDD-NOS  GFCF, Yasko, RDI  Did ABA for 14 mos.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Joey, 6 yrs., PDD-NOS  GFCF, Yasko, RDI  Did ABA for 14 mos.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">respect sad to say but we had to show &amp; have written proof of how much Evans had reggresed, We had, documented all of his seccions at home and as he entered school. With these documents and his reggresion it was easy to show a child at k- at a level of 2 to 3 yrs old to a 3rd grade in him being on a 5 mont leval in order for the school to say they would even concider a one -on -one.     Even with that much of reggresion i almost had to  find &amp; get a lawyer in florida, It was HELL &amp; to say the least, i would never want to go down that road once more. The school system will NOT make it any easier for us parents until you, We learn the rules and how to become advocates for our children &amp; get respected by the Dep of Special ED.  My hubby &amp; I had to go &amp; get traine to learn how to fight the school  system so that they inturn would provide according to the LAW. With  this in our pockets the entired town new who we were, and did not want to get in our way of NOT providing to Evans what he was in need off. Those who did  NOT provide  lost their jobs of 15 yrs on board of a easy ride.     These people who work in the school system are very well trained to NOT provide &amp; loook as if they are  giving it all, as one of the ladies mentioned on the post written to Grandma C.  The proper word OUT of compliance by law.  To many it is a very knowledgeable GAME.   The law that protects our children is beautiful but with out us knowing how to assess it, It is wortless to our children and  us. LM gave you a very good suggestion if you can hire a advocate to help you write a new I.E.P for you baby they will know how to help you access a One -on-One  aid /trained  therapist for your child.  Good Luck to you &amp; your baby. My   prayers go out  to all who are starting to go down this road with the school system, it is not a easy road to travel on  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /> but we are all survivors &amp; we will persevere in the end. We as parents need to  presist with team members of our schools  &amp; our  continuous determination will help the schools create  the proper programs that will help our children grow &amp; meet their goals  for their  future. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" /> To all on this forum</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">It\'s just a stage you are going through. Nothing stays the same for ever.   Do not listen to the names you are being called. You are a wonderful person with lots of personality and the potential to do great things. This is your right.   Just try and learn some relaxation techiniques. Does your church or local community provide any of these?  Patience is something we all got to learn better. Enjoy the moment and the journey rather than the final outcome.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I haven\'t been in that situation, so I\'m not sure.  I imagine if you have a private eval done, they have to take it into consideration.  If you feel he needs support, the school district should be willing to do the eval.  They need to do whatever benefits the child so that he can progress not only academically, but socially and emotionally as well.  Just my 2 cents.  dory</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ I had to be there, to get here.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ I had to be there, to get here.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">My son is 4 years old and in the spectrum. He is verbal and his behaviour is generally ok. The challenge I have with him right now is his in-attentiveness. He can be lost in the middle of his task and most of the times he will not answer when I call/talk to him (although I\'m sure he heard what I said). I went to ADD site and browsed through the ADD tell tale signs. I\'m a bit confused now, he could be considered ADD (in addition to ASD) with what I described above. But again, isn\'t ASD about those \'symptoms\' as well? Do you see this issue with your child? Or is my child really ASD+ADD?</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Also, I guess I\'m thinking that when your teaching him that he needs to finish maybe if he doesn\'t  have to  finish the <em>whole</em> thing at first. I\'m thinking that if he is upset about doing puzzles and showing it maybe it won\'t escalate quite so quickly if the demands are lowered and eased up. So your doing the puzzle and he\'s showing signs that he wants to stop yesterday. Well maybe you acknowledge and say OK just one more. That way  even if a hand over hand has to be done it\'s really quick and the priase comes quick too and it didn\'t seem like some eternity to him. Then the next time he has to do a small bit more, so you are working  his tolerance for frustration rather than expecting complete compliance all at once.</div>  Yes, this is historically how we\'ve handled it, though again, in this case it is a puzzle he has done before w/ assistance so I think the OT felt that she knew he was capable of completing the task based on history, so in her mind it was important for him to complete it again.  FWIW, Cole\'s new swim instructor has a similar philosophy of \"no going back\" so if she sees that he is capable of something just once, she will expect it from him again.  Some days he may night feel up to it, but she doesn\'t just let him get out of the pool.  And on some levels I agree with her thinking.  What I don\'t agree with is <em>how </em>it was  handled - and again, I\'m not so much \"blaming\" her as I am trying to determine what a better option would be - something that we other therapists/aides can get on board with as well, consistently and realistically.    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Just out of curiousity, I know you say he can do the puzzles but is this something he ever chooses to do when therapists are not around?</div>  This was one of those fishing magnet puzzle games.  He (w/ assistance) had taken all of the fish out and it was time to put them back in.  After a few, he\'d had enough (still trying to analyze why, and I think there might be a few factors: 1) at home on his turf, testing the situation, 2) OT and I were talking to one another and it wasn\'t about praise for him, 3) It is a challenging puzzle w/ no pictures in the background to match up and funny curves/edges).  Anyway, he has a similar fishing magnet game at  home, but it is put up where he cannot get to it alone (because he likes to walk around with the magnet stick - magnet in mouth  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shocked\" /> )  As you know, puzzles in general are not his strength - and they are one of the programs I resisted in NJ and we were sure to set him up w/ simple ones he could handle.  For Cole resistance to certain (not all) fine-motor tasks are not simply a matter of comprehension and non compliance, but a genuine motor-planning/motor challenge.  However, over time, with absense of pressure and addition of maturity, he has improved and can do simple puzzles on his own (w/ prompting) and is generally much more open to being a sport and trying them than he was back several months ago in Jersey.  (Btw, this brings us back to Nick\'s #3, and I think because praise <em>is </em>so reinforcing, this may also be a big issue for him as well).    <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">ETA- I realize that everything I\'ve said  may be really the absolute wrong thing to do for another child and actually I may be giving out really crappy advice. By nature I think the whole \"compliance\" thing/word for a toddler/young preschooler just freaks me out a little. It\'s entirely possible that we are too easy on Aidan.</div>  I think as parents we are all doing what we feel is best for our unique kids, based on their abilities, our circumstances, and our own values.  I agree that the term and concept of forced \"compliance\" is troubling and counter-intuitive, which is why I\'m giving this so much thought.  And to be honest, if in your situation, I would likely be approaching it from a different angle w/ different consequences in mind.  In other words, if I knew that Cole would be the only delayed child in his preschool class as Aidan is (I think?), I would feel a little more relaxed knowing that teachers would likely be more sensitive and forgiving of his special needs. But at this point Little Man\'s placement is still up in the air (and I am preparing a plan C -homeschooling-as we speak! lol) so I feel that I <strong>have</strong> to help him comply, but I need to find a way to do it that doesn\'t include physical force.  Having said that, it sounds far more ugly than it actually was --- maybe.  MCA\'s recent post has me feeling more sensitive to this subject, which I am grateful for.  Because Little Man\'s delays could well be life-long, and while I want him to understand and function as independently as possible, I don\'t want him to think that it is OK for all adults to physically enforce compliance, thus leaving him feeling totally powerless.  As a disclaimer here, I also want to stress again that every one of our kids are different, and it really, really, really does make a difference in how we choose to proceed I think.  [/quote]</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">oooh - another good day, and a GREAT evening!      D had an accident in his room this am (pee), which was VERY out of character, and he\'s got diarrhea again today (greenish with black specks), as well as lots of toots and big watery sounding burps (even threw up in his mouth a bit a couple times  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\" /> ) So I think perhaps some stuff is clearing his system now that I\'m not overloading the poor kid with phenols.    Help me remember again:     what is PST or whatever, the thing you need sulpher for, and it makes an enzyme, or is an enzyme, that\'s involved with removing something or other?  And if you have too much phenol, it gets overburdened with that, and can\'t do what it\'s supposed to do?     I know I\'m not talking out of my arse here, but I can\'t quite remember the specifics.      Anyway, does the fact that D was doing so well with the supplements, then started doing SO badly with that antihistamine (full of phenols), and now that he\'s off that stuff he\'s doing well and appears to be detoxing (diarrhea, gas, wetting) all mean that something in the supplements I\'m giving him is helping his little body detoxify?  If \"yes\", what do you think it is, and should I give more of it?    As a recap, D is on a good multivitamin which includes digestive enzymes and amino acids (including methionine), probiotics, GSE, magnesium sulfate cream (homemade with coconut oil), and cal/mag.  Once things stabilize, I\'ll start adding zinc (I already have it, just haven\'t been giving it).    After seeing him turn around again after just three days off of the antihistamine, I\'m even more convinced that all this biomed stuff works.  I can\'t WAIT to order some NDF Plus and get started with that.  Although I am worried about how effective it will (or won\'t) be with D\'s mouth full of metal.  He\'s got four metal caps and one metal filling.  I can\'t do anything about it right now because I\'m not his legal guardian yet, and he\'s not on my health/dental insurance yet.  While I\'d like to hope our adoption will be all finalized by the end of summer, in truth it could easily be another six months to a year, and worst case scenario they\'ll rule he\'s aboriginal (he\'s not) and he\'ll have to remain a foster child permanently (although with us thank goodness).  They\'re all baby teeth, but they\'re not likely to fall out for a while.    Anyway, D had his monthly physio/ot today, and she couldn\'t BELIEVE how much more with it and verbal he is.  He walked in, kicked off his shoes, said \"Hi Loren\" and headed straight to the therapy room (all unprompted) and she just about fell over  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" />     We didn\'t have a SINGLE problem with D today at home, and I even got him to eat grapefruit (he chose it over orange).  After school, I took the boys swimming at the lake, and they had a wonderful time, although D\'s ears hurt him really badly (he said they were too loud AND hurts).  It wasn\'t from diving, as he didn\'t go that deep, and I don\'t think it\'s water in the ear, as he wasn\'t shaking his head or trying to drain his ears.  This has been going on for some time.  He sees the ped tomorrow, so I\'ll bring it up then, as well as demanding a test for histamine levels and his overall vitamin/mineral levels (never been done).  Hopefully I can get the doc to listen to me and at least consider that the supplements have been helping...</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Jakesmom, this is incredibly helpful.  I <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal\">URGENTLY </span>need to know the source information for this article and a bit more background on it.  Is this the Dept of Education for your state?   I\'m sorry because I do know that you posted the author and the date, is it published online somewhere that I can send someone to?    Thanks</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">thanks for the explanation.. i guess whenever money is concerned, it just gets overly complicated.     I have the pretty unique experience of having worked at Eden Institute in Princeton, an ABA school for children with autism, ten years ago, long before I had my son.      Besides the use of aversives, which may be discontinued at this point, Eden  is remarkably similar to the school my son now attends (DDI/YAP):  One certified teacher, several trained aides, individual therapy rooms, etc..     So here are some hints for finding schools that are \'good\' for ABA:    1. only spectrum kids in the program (if there are others, than i suspect its a watered-down \"something for everyone\" program).     2. Rooms set up conducive to 1:1 or 1:2 ratio.  If the kids are all in one big room, doubtful that they can get ABA done. Both Eden and DDI/YAP have common area, and individual therapy rooms. At YAP the parents come in for \"move-in\" day and set up the kids rooms as home-away-from-home.    3. Inclusion program for kids who are ready (part-time to begin) to go outside into typical pre-school or play groups.    4. School should have a mission statement along the lines of \"to make children indistinguishable from peers\" and have the statistics to back it up, regarding kindergarden placements.    5. If they call it \"task time\" or \"modified ABA\", then find out why it is modified and if they have data to support why its not true ABA.    6. Ask how many of the kids receive additional services at home. DDI/YAP requires 10 hours per week 1:1 at home. Shows that they are basing practices on research.    7. They should have a philisophy about when/how to phase out ABA in favor of more natural learning. Very important!      Good Luck.     Hope you find something in New Hampshire and don\'t have to move!    Irene</div>'

It is a program that  can be provided by school to a child that is high functioning or does not have a disability but has some kind of inparement that will not let a child fuction to his or her full capability.  A 504 plan is a accommodation plan to help the child work at his /her own pace &amp; speed while still remaining with his or her own peers in class. This will give the child more extra time if they need to do any assigment for the teachers, class work ect..... and if the child needs extra help the teachers need &amp; have  to provide it to the student. You DO need a doctors note to bring it to the school * staff of I.E.P team and have this documented  in  writting  if you which for the school to provide these sevices to your child.  (A 5o4 is not a I.E.P) It is a accommodation plan to help your child with there school corriculum.

Right now, everyone comments how \"cute\" his voice is, but I\'m sure as he gets older it will be more noticeably different (which is why I\'m trying to work on it).  His intonation is obviously incorrect and he sometimes \"sings\" the end of sentences.  His speech therapist has him humming to the piano to try to make him more aware of his tone, imitating her tone when saying things, and singing songs.  We have never had this tone with him (singing or incorrect intonation), I think it is just an ASD thing for him.  I would be curious how other people have worked to improve this also.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">That is correct. But I thought under the age of 5 the brain does a decent job of regenerating some of the lost connections atleast ... and OK that part is still being debated, the only one that is certain is of course Orac and he says it doesn\'t ... yea I remember ... Of course that explains nothing about why chelating kids gets them better and chelating older kids also gets them to cover lost ground.  Cool.  Srinath.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Yes since he was 8mo we have had him working with pt ot both 2or 3 times a wk. PT was stopped at 1 1/2 yrs. Ot only 1 time a month now. SI since 1 yr at 1st 2 times a wk now once a wk.  ABA 2 times a wk for last 6months. When he started he had been on a ng for months he couldn\'t sit roll or hold his head up. But they still thought I was irrational at the time they had just dx his liver chirrosis. we had known he had liver problems he was taking meds for it. Thought that all the health problems was why he wasn\'t doing that stuff. It was not even before then he didn\'t do stuff. don\'t get me wrong he almost died.  Just no one wanted to listen. He did great with pt once we fixed all his cf issues.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">They are probably referring to the same thing. Sensory seeking means that Brandon is seeking some type of sensory input. Self stimulatory behavior is behavior that is reinforcing in and of itself and usually consists of behaviors that would be described as sensory seeking. If he is walking on his toes, he might be seeking the sensory input of how it feels to walk on his toes and or doesn\'t like how the ground feels on his feet so it feels better to walk on his toes. Even though the behaviors are reinforcing in and of themselves, if they are interfering with learning or dangerous (such as hitting himself), it is possible to analyze the behaviors and determine what type of input he is seeking and help redirect that input into more appropriate behavior and to teach him times of the day that it is ok to do those things so that it doesn\'t interfere with his learning. Currently there is little research to suggest that allowing self stimulatory behavior makes a child more autistic but if the self stimulatory behavior is interfering with learning or interacting with the world, then it will be harder to teach him skills. Some parents allow the behavior , some allow it but limit it, and some do not allow it all. That is a choice for you to make. The best thing to do as well is to enrich your child\'s environment with the sensory input he is seeking. For instance I know a little boy who goes around hitting couches, the floor, and other surfaces very hard with his hands. We put two big balls in the therapy room and now he hits those instead. We can also use the balls as reinforcers and interact with him by passing the balls, throwing the balls, etc where as when he walks around hitting the couches, floor, etc we cannot really interact with him. Hope this helps!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">We had the most amazing evaluation yesterday.  We started down this path w/DS last July, when a psychologist we didn\'t really like but were stuck with said he thought DS had moderate autism.  Based on the symptoms, I agreed, but we stopped in the middle of the formal eval because the guy was a serious jerk.    Fast forward four months, and DS is reevaluated by a psych who we thought we were going to see for RDI training.  We\'re not, but that\'s a whole different thread.  At that point, she believed PDD-NOS was more accurate.  She completed an ADOS and said that DS did not meet the criteria for classic autism.    We\'ve been on the waiting list all this time for the local expert - people come from all over to see this guy, and yesterday we finally had our turn.  He observed DS playing (like a modified ADOS), interviewed us at length, and did an ABBLS(sp?) test w/DS.  He says that the best fit is now Asperger\'s, that DS doesn\'t not even fit PDD-NOS anymore and is nowhere near classic autism.  In one of the skill areas he tested well above average, average in two, and below average in one (listening).  His expressive language tested in the normal range!!!  In July, it was over a year delayed; now it\'s just plain old normal.  He\'s not having complex conversations yet or telling me about his day, but in every other way he sounds great.  The psychologist said that DS\'s prognosis is excellent.    I can\'t believe how far biomedical has helped DS climb up the spectrum.  He\'s not in any intensive therapies, just plain old ST, OT, and PT.  They\'ve helped, but without the biomed, there\'s no way they\'d be as effective.  I don\'t know where I\'m headed with this, except to tell anyone doubting that this is the right course to hang in there, and to thank everyone on this site for all the help I\'ve gotten so far - you guys are awesome!</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Mom to one 4-yr-old boy, dx w/Asperger\'s</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Mom to one 4-yr-old boy, dx w/Asperger\'s</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Grandma C, you\'re not dimwitted - it\'s a scientific article, and hard to read.  I had to read through it a couple of times - all the gobbledygook about genes and sample groups is hard to decipher initially.    From what I understand, there are some children in the Amish community who initially seem \"normal\", then, around 14-17 months of age, start having seizures.  They grow out of these seizures within a few years.  However, by the time these kids are 3, they show learning and behavioral symptoms that are the same as those of children with autism.    The Amish are an isolate gene pool - their genes are all very similar to one another, unlike people outside of the Amish, who\'s genes are vastly different.  The fact that these genes between the Amish are similar, made it easier to examine genes that are different between two individuals.    Like, if you have 100 beads, and 90 are blue, the other 10 are different colors - those 10 stand out, and are easy to pick out, you know what I mean?  So, as an analogy, imagine you\'ve  got 10 Amish people.  imagine their genes are colored beads, strung in a sequence, like a necklace.  Because they\'re closely related, most of their beads are the same color as one another - very few differences.  Because of this, it\'s easy to look at the differences.  By contrast, you and I, who are not Amish (you\'re not Amish are you? lol), if our genes were beads, they would be almost all different from one another.  It makes it much harder to see where the IMPORTANT differences are.    With the Amish, because there are fewer differences, they were able to look at these kids that were having seizures and \"autism\", and see what differences they had in common.  These kids all have one gene (or bead) that is different from all the other Amish people (who don\'t have seizures and autism), but the same as one another.  Bingo.  This difference in this gene is causing the condition.    Now does this make sense?    This research is really in the early stages, and hasn\'t been applied to the general population yet.  They don\'t know yet if this is a genetic disorder that only applies to Amish people, or if other people also carry it.  At this point in time, it doesn\'t mean anything specific for Evan, unless he\'s of Amish descent.    I hope this helps?</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Alright, hi, my name is Clockdown. What brings me to this board is my boyfriend who I\'ve been e-dating for about two-months straight now. This isn\'t the first time I\'ve tried to have a relationship with him as we tried maybe a year and half ago. But I am now starting to suspect, as is he, that he may have some form of autism and was hoping if you might be able to at least help us put things together to understand what we\'re dealing with. I\'ll explain below.  My boyfriend is 21 and I am 24-years old. The two of us are currently in college, I\'m going for Illustration and he is going for game programming. Like I mentioned before we\'ve tried having a relationship because we both share very similiar interests in a plethora of areas, but there are times where it\'s very difficult to be with him. Traits I\'ve noticed about him are:  - Quiet while speaking, does not speak up when something is bothering him. He keeps his feelings and thoughts to himself.  - Low word count. He often replies with &quot;Nothing.&quot; or &quot;I don\'t know.&quot; If I ask him to speak more, he would merely say something like &quot;I don\'t know what to say.&quot; or something similiar. He has said before he has difficulty talking for some reason.  - Talkative about specific subjects only. He\'s very interested in sexual discussions, but mainly fixed around fetishes. And even then, these discussions are limited to specific things. such as sexual acts as opposed to more lengthy discussion.  - Tends to have difficulty maintaining attention. For instance, he could be speaking to me but almost always he\'s either a) looking at a different computer b) watching tv c) goofing around without actually talking. And when he does speak, his vocabulary is very limited.  - Fantastic grammar skills. This is the thing that boggles me, he can write stories and flesh out characters perfectly, however when he is himself, he has difficulty merely talking.  - Has difficulty listening to music with words. The majority of the music he listens to tends to be purely instrumental, however when given music which contains words, he\'s unable to actually follow along with the music or only happens to be able to pick out a single word or two from the music.  - When he does speak, he only speaks when upset or when he explodes. For instance, he recently said he wanted to end the relationship with me because he wanted more time to himself. Not only that but he also listed off a bunch of other reasons why he wanted to end it.  - He is very prone to overreact to things. For instance, if I suggest something which I would like to do, which may be in opposition to an idea of his or what he\'s doing, he feels defensive or bothered because he feels as if what he\'s done so far is not good enough and that is why I\'m suggesting things. When in reality, I\'m merely brainstorming ideas with him, with which he replies with &quot;I don\'t know&quot; to when I ask him if he has any ideas of his own he wants to contribute.  - He is very, as I mentioned earlier, attracted to pornography. At any given time he\'s usually browsing it and seems somewhat obsessive about the whole process, which is basically looking at it. It\'s normal to look at it, sure, but he seems to do it too much.  I love him very much, and he says he loves me, but I\'m starting to feel a little taxed by everything. I don\'t want to have to end a relationship with him because he\'s the only person I\'ve known to share so many interests, and be very kind as well, but he just seems very peculiar. For instance, I can go on about praising him all different reasons, and basically shower with him affection, yet he is unable to do the same verbally nor does he try.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">My son is doing very well!  He will be 10 in just under two weeks time.  He\'s in a mainstream classroom with minimal aide supports, as we have been actively phasing it out for the past couple of academic years.  The time of school that challenges him the most is lunchtime and lunch recess.  LOTS of stimulation during those times!  Smells, noise, tons of kids--it\'s a lot for even a typical child. His social struggles are decreasing over time.  He now has playdates, which were pretty undoable for a few years.  For one thing, he didn\'t especially care one way or the other if other children came over.  Now, he has taken matters into his own hands by swiping my cell phone, looking up his buddy\'s mom\'s number and calling her himself.   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /> I was pretty amazed the first time that happened!   My boyfriend\'s son is three years older than my son and just left today after a three week visit.  He and my son played video games together a LOT over those three weeks as well as just hanging out and playing in the pool.  I am very pleased with how well they got on!  We still monitor activities, but honestly, not much.  The older boy was very impressed with my son\'s abilities on video games and learned a thing or two himself.  Sweet! I don\'t worry too much about my son\'s future.  He has progressed so much since his diagnosis so many years ago.  He dresses himself, picks up after himself and remembers when he has something important coming up.  To me, these skills are just as important as academics and social skills, and they are what he will need to live independently one day.  He has taken an interest in cooking and food preparation, so we have begun to teach him how to read and follow directions.  It\'s a wonderful thing to have brownies made by your child.   <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile\" />  I hope that everyone has a wonderful story to tell here.  It\'s what keeps other parents going! Take care!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">My son didn\'t play appropriately (I know that comes later, but still.)  He just wouldn\'t be interested in toys, or even mobiles.  He\'d look at the carpet and notice individual fibers.  As he got a bit older he\'d play repetitively or be stuck on one toy (more than just an attachment to a blankie).  He\'d sit there and open and shut cabinet doors.  He\'d put toys in drawers or doors or whatever small openings he could find.  We used to say he was like a dog hiding a bone, but he got his enjoyment out of the hiding part, not from going back for it later.    It is too early to tell but keep an eye on things.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi all, Just wondering if anyone has had any luck with correcting a regression in potty training. My dear boy is 3.5 and seems moderate as far as in comparison to other ASD kids. He took to potty training just fine a few months ago. Would wait to go until he was taken to the potty, something we did at regular intervals. Accidents weren\'t terribly often, but usually between these trips. He\'d gotten to the point where he\'d even run over if he realized he was going. Early on, we reinforced him going with popsicles and lollipops. Those were phased out and he got the hang of things pretty well.    So, two weeks ago, he completely regressed - accidents constantly. He\'s also completely refusing to sit down on the potty regardless of the reinforcer. Even the ones he can\'t resist, he\'s refusing if they are in conjunction with the potty. He\'ll just sit down and cry rather than go to the potty to get them. If we get him to sit on the potty, he\'ll wait a second, signal or tell us \"all done\" and then have an accident once he\'s off the potty and in another room. I don\'t even know where to go next. Back to pullups? Back to the videos and books? The TSS\'s are stumped, too. I\'m guessing that something pretty bad happened when I wasn\'t around and it\'s serving to reinforce a fear (maybe??) of going potty.    If you have any thoughts or suggestions, I would really welcome them. I figured potty training would take a very long time, but I wasn\'t ready for him to regress completely.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thank you!  It is nice to know that people out there understand.  Sometimes it can feel so lonely.  I have joined a local support group here which should also help. When living in PA, we had all the therapies and aides we needed.  Now since moving, I feel like I am &quot;not on my game&quot;. I will certainly take your advice.  My son is verbal (which we are very blessed) but seems to be very angry and uses words like &quot;shoot you&quot; or &quot;kill you&quot; and it is hard to figure out where he gets this stuff from.  I know he played cops and robbers with friends, but it does have me concerned sometimes.  We also want our son to be raised to be kind and use good words and it feels some days like I am a broken record reminding him. Thanks for listening and for your response.  It is greatly appreciated!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Wow, your situation really takes me back. We had a therapist who had some experience and some skills, but who thought she was smarter that the consultants. She created a lot of problems in our program until we finally got rid of her. She simply would not be a \"team player.\" In retrospect, we should have been very clear with her very soon in the process that she was free to voice her opinions at team meetings but she had to follow the consultant\'s directions.    I would give the consultant the \"heads up\" about what this therapist is saying and doing, so he/she can try to deal with it. Hopefully, your therapist will be amenable to following the program and also to documenting any concerns she has with programs, such as by taking data rather than relying on her feelings about what your child should be doing!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Believe it or not, my reaction wasn\'t about you.  I wasn\'t discussing your parenting skills or your ability to love your son, which are things I cannot possibly know.  I don\'t even know you (to be honest I have a lot of trouble tracking who is who in forums without avatars).  I had to say \"stop\" somewhere, and it happened to be you.  It could have been anyone else.  I have no intention to make you in particular feel self-conscious, and I wasn\'t addressing you in particular with anything I said (except when I was explicit that it wasn\'t about you).  So I guess I\'m saying you don\'t really have anything to worry about from me.  If that\'s reassuring at all.    The microscope feeling I can believe it or not relate to.  That\'s how it feels to me to have everyone asking questions all the time.  I just had no other means available to me than to say \"stop\", and it was inevitably going to be after <em>some</em> person had asked something.  If it helps at all, I\'m really sorry it had to be you.  I don\'t want to make you feel like you\'re under a microscope, I was just trying to get out from under the microscope myself.  I know that you weren\'t trying to put me under a microscope either, and I understand why you were curious, though.  Maybe I should have made it a separate post, and then you wouldn\'t have felt like you were being singled out, but I can\'t really reverse history at this point.  (Maybe the moderator could split the thread, though, and then other people won\'t see it as me reacting to you specifically either, which will keep other people from forming conclusions about you.)</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ \"If you\'re watching it, you\'re part of it.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hello-  Can someone tell me what to think of this.  So many of you on this board have been kind enough to give your opinions on my 19 month ds.  Most of you have said he sounds like he\'ll be fine (including a Dev. Ped., EI, therapists, blah, blah, blah).     We went to our local county fair last night and my ds was really excited and pointing to animals, trucks, balloons,  you name it.  He LITERALLY pointed at 75 things and was saying things like oohhhh ahhhh.  Not one time did he look at us to see if we were seeing what he was seeing.  Now I know that this is a red flag.  What should I think about this?    Who is he pointing at things of interest for, if he doesn\'t want us to look?  I saw other kids his age, practically turning all the way around in their stroller to see if their mom was paying attention to what they were looking at.    Am I making too big of a deal about this?  This seems really significant.  I know pointing to things of interest is a good thing, but what if he isn\'t looking at us for a reaction?    On the other hand, when he does something naughty or something good or funny, he will look for our reaction most of the time.    So confused.  Thoughts???</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">WE too are going through this. Last Mon night he went to bed with the diaper and 15 min later it was smeared EVERYWHERE!!! It is so very depressing to clean it up. I too was at my whits end. Our team of therapists gave me the option to buy a special onesie that he could not get out of or to put him in something that zips up the back so he can\'t get it off. We have resorted to footsie pj\'s that are safety pinned closed!!! WE also started potty training this week. This is so very difficult. Brian is 3 1/2. He has some words. He can label favorites and echo sometimes. He has very poor receptive and understands little spoken language. . I wonder how this is gonna work. We are following training techniques provided by my team behaviorist. It is so very draining. We can never let him out of our sight. I just keep telling myself that the alternative is going back to diapers and finding more messes like the other night. I don\'t think I could handle that again. I am not sure how this is gonna work but I have to try something. I hope Koda gives you a rest. You are so very busy with 6 children to care for. I see that he is 5 so the restrictive clothing may be a hard fit. How about an old Superman/Batman costume that he could step into and you tie in the back?? Maybe then he can\'t get to it?? Just brainstorming.  I hope things get better for you. Nancy</div>'

I want a doctor who has his head AND his heart invested in the outcome.

He is young, only 30 months. Basically, at the end of his session, he spends a few minutes at a table with the headphones while doing something like pulling coins out of therapy dough. Sometimes, she will turn off the lights in the gym and let him swing on a tire swing while the tape is on surround sound. She doesn\'t feel like he is ready to do it at home yet and they are not selling anything. Implementing this program is not costing us anything additional.     My SLP is also an audiologist. When I told her that the OT was doing this with Aidan she expressed interest but did not give an opinion one way or the other - just asked to keep her updated on how it is going and how they are implementing it.    As for CAPD, Aidan is much to young to be considering that at this point. The listening program, seems to be to see if it helps Aidan to \"organize\" himself. As he seems to enjoy it and no money has been requested, I have not had any problems with it thus far.    Does anyone think it is dangerous? Should I not be allowing them to do this? He really seems to enjoy it so far. One last thing, my OT has requested that I be sure to record if Aidan seems to become \"more sensitive\" to anything. He is a 100% sensory seeker - never avoids anything sensory so she wanted me to be alert to any changes and to bring them up with her if I see any.     Cympreni - Thank you so very much for sharing all that information with us. I\'m sure it was time consuming but wanted you to know it was very appreciated  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif\" alt=\":P\" title=\"Razz\" />     Jen</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Kayley, 5(NT)  Aidan, 3 (PDD-NOS)</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Kayley, 5(NT)  Aidan, 3 (PDD-NOS)</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I started to get concerned with Mason at 12mo. and asked for referrals....they suggested I \"wait and see.\"  I called for a specific appointment at 16 mo., and they agreed to hearing and speech evaluations.  He failed the hearing evaluation (and we were convinced that was what it was - unfortunately it was built up enormous amounts of wax and fluid), so we scheduled an ABR - hearing came back normal.  Speech clearly delayed.  Spent the next 6 months with Mason having chronic ear infections (he\'s had chronic ear infections since 6 weeks of age, but it played a bigger role when he was getting diagnosed it seems) - ended up with tubes, some speech and sounds started then, but no big wows like we hoped.  Started EI evaluations at 18 mo., began services at 22 mo. - referred to developmental Ped.  who indicated only \"speech delay, not impressed by autistic symptoms\", second visit 4 months later the same developmental Ped. suggested Mason was M.R., Mason began Early Childhood Special Education Services at 2yr. 9 mo. then 4 months later the same developmental pediatrician reluctantly scribbled ASD on a prescription pad and sent us to VCU for multi-disciplinary evaluations - Mason was formally diagnosed at 3yr. 4 mo.  He will be entering his 3rd year of preschool services in September.  It was a long road.    Madison I had no suspicions (except in hindsight) until she started preschool at age 3yr. 3 mo.  then her teacher (a former special ed. teacher) pulled me aside and told me her concerns and said she suspected PDD.  Madison had aged out of EI by then so we went straight to our Pediatrician and the school system for evaluations - We were in the midst of getting Mason diagnosed so we went to the same yucky developmental pediatrician who laughed at us when I brought up PDD - he said, she is JUST FINE!  She qualified for services through the school part-time and continued at her regular preschool.  If we hadn\'t been going thru all of this w/Mason I don\'t think Madison would be diagnosed at all right now, I probably wouldn\'t have pursued it.  She is very high functioning, attends mainstream school and camps with out supports, is academically gifted, but does have a hard time occassionally in social situations.  We feel she is probably Aspergers vs. the PDD-NOS diagnosis we have but they won\'t tell us that for sure until she\'s a bit older.  She was formally diagnosed last summer at 5 yr. 3 mo. - it was a year wait for both kids for a multi-disciplinary evaluation.      Both kids will be re-evaluated in 2008.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Amy  Mom to:  Madison - age 8 (PDD-NOS)  Mason - age 6.5(ASD)  Emerson - 3.5 (NT)</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Amy  Mom to:  Madison - age 8 (PDD-NOS)  Mason - age 6.5(ASD)  Emerson - 3.5 (NT)</div>'

I think he was exposed to it in utero.  He did get all of his infant vaccinations as well.  He will not be getting his kindergarten shots.  I have two kids younger than him that have not had all of their shots because I put them on hold while I was researching the issue.  And since he hadn\'t had them when we went into the ER I was afraid they would want to give him a booster tetnus shot so I asked about it and that was how the whole thing came up with the ER doc.  My oldest daughter and my autistic son both got them all.  My two youngest girls got some but not all.  Hope that clears up the confusion, sorry it was so hard to decipher.</div>'

FWIW,    I looked into RDI and my personal opinion (not that it\'s worth much, but hey...) is that RDI has <em>the answers</em> to the specific central problems of autism... no joke, I personally think they\'ve GOT IT, but the solutions as put forth by the RDI authors/consultants are not as helpful as the theory itself.    I listened to the DVD and was beside myself with how awesome the theory was, but was unable to find a consultant to bring it to life, or understand the how-to books (all of which I bought$$$$) myself enough to do it.      My friends in my area who are doing RDI are becoming disenchanted with difficulty in execution and progression through the stages.  I see RDI falling out of favor (at least where I live) and I don\'t think it\'s due to something wrong with the theory, I just think it\'s not catching on, and needs to be revamped somewhat.    I wish there was some way to bring this awesome therapy to life rather than what is currently out there, because I really think this one\'s \"the ticket.\"      OK, not much help, I know, just thought I\'d weigh in.

' <div class=\"postbody\">When I started ABA,  the behavior analyst talked about \"learning to learn\" but unfortunately,  I have not seen this practically implemented.  I was hoping that the ABA will give him the basic skill to observe and learn from the environment the way normally developing kids effortlessly do.      For my 4 year old son,  he cannot observe because he tends to be in his own world rather than paying attention to the environment.   For example, in a small play group,  he has no sense that there is a teacher talking to the group and he needs constant prompting to pay attention to the teacher.  He does well on 1:1 ABA sessions and with parents but does not genaralize.   After almost one year of ABA,  he still does not respond to people (other than parents and therapists) because he does not observe and pay attention to people and environment.       So the concept \"learning to learn\" sounds good in theory but is there a way to effectively implement it?</div>'

Usually the reasons kids are unable to be included in regular ed is because of behavior issues or they are simply not able to keep up academically, even at their own level, in a general ed environment. Has a general ed placement ever been tried for your grandson?    If his communication issues are what is keeping him out of a general ed class then there should be accomodations that can be made so that he can be successful, especially at the kindergarten level. Of course, this may get more difficult as he gets older.     The law is on your side in asking for inclusion, children are entitled to be placed in the Least Restrictive Environment.

I think it sounds like a Dr. Laura situation sort of. You\'ve all got these kids, who have to come first, yet you want adult relationships which everyone should have a right to have.    Are you thinking marriage? If so, all of the kids would have to go through huge adjustments. It\'s never easy to blend a family, but people do it all the time. I myself grew up in one, but we were the only kids -- never had to deal with stepsibs.    You could either blend now while theyr\'e all young and moldeable, or you could postpone a permanent arrangement until your son is much older and you\'ve got his life under control.    Love overcomes all things, supposedly, but kids do have to come first as well, IMO. How is it for the kids? Do they all like being together?

' <div class=\"postbody\">Grandma C,     I want to share with you my experience. I also thought, \"More is better\". Unfortunately this often does not work for our kids.     My son had private speech therapy since he was 2. At age 3 he went to \"specialâ€ preschool. At school, he got the ST services 2 times a week. I kept our private ST because she was very good and really knew my son. Unfortunately the school had a different style that the private ST and she did different things with him. Because the 2 ST were doing different programs they confused my son even more.... so you see if you have more that 2 therapists in is <strong>IMPORTANT that they agree to carry the same goals and style of therapy.</strong>    OT -&gt; this is what we did to get the services. Our social worker said she needed the medical prescription for OT evaluation. I called our pediatrician, got the prescription and send it to school. They send OT to evaluate my son, and based on her evaluation school provided 2 hours/week of OT.     <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">It is very important to understand how IEP process works</span>. IEP team looks at OT\' eval as an expert opinion. (The same process goes for ST.)   If OT states that a child needs X hours/week of OT, school has no choice but to provide the services. Usually OTs are nice people, and they understand the needs of our kids. It is good to get to know them and have a good relationship with them. They are part of your IEP team, and may push for more services. Also, when talking to OT, it is better to focus on childâ€™s needs than on childâ€™s strengths. If you paint \"darker\" picture they may provide more, than if you tell them that your kid is fantastic but just needs a little help with gross motor skills.     And the last thing â€“ it is worth to â€œfightâ€ for services from school district. The disability of our kids will last for long time. They have right to receive services. If you get the services in the beginning, the school will have to provide them until they can prove that they are no longer needed.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I may have posted this before, but from reading some of the posts in this thread, it seems that parents are not part of the ABA team. They should be. I had to undergo the same training as my therapists and have my skills \"judged\" at follow-up meetings. This was really crucial because I was a member of the team, not just \"Mom.\" I know some parents can\'t do trials with their kids. But even just undergoing the training is helpful, because you can \"talk their (ABA) language.\" If your consultants are not making you part of the team, then ask them, why not? How can you generalize the skills if you\'re not part of the team? By the way, this applies to any program, not just ABA. I would think it would be valuable to be part of the VB or RDI team as well. It\'s not good therapy if parents are completely out of the loop!</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Spraggle99 I had flashbacks reading your post.  We would have to put my son in his room with the lights off and everyone being quiet.  He quite literally got sensory overload.  He would frequently then fall asleep.  Tired and overstimulated.  But I have to agree with rosiemom I cannot emphasize enough how important the GFCF diet can be, especially when it comes to sensory issues.  Over and over parents say that sensory issues that trigger the screaming and banging heads and tantrums decrease on this diet.  Although for us once I figured out it was severe gas pain and not night terrors that were waking us up I was prompted to go ahead and do the diet, potty training was kind of a bonus.  But I didn\'t start it until he was almost four and I really regret waiting so long.  If you want some info on starting it and my eight page list of safe foods email me I\'ll be more than happy to share it with you.  <!-- e --><a href=\"mailto:pubrulz@gmail.com\">pubrulz@gmail.com</a><!-- e -->    The ABA was really worth it for us too.  My son went from tantrums being his only form of communication to being able to tell me he wanted a drink using words.  PECS and sign language helped a ton right at first until he could start verbalizing.  I don\'t know if anyone has shown you how to do the Picture ExChange System (PECS) if there is a speech therapist you can go see then go have them teach you how to do it.  It isn\'t hard but there is a right way. I think that for a lot of our kids many of their temper tantrums are from sheer frustration of not being able to communicate.  After a while I was able to stop the tantrum right at the begining by prompting him to \"SHOW ME WHAT YOU WANT\" using the picture cards, then by sign language then by \"USING YOUR WORDS\".  But that will come later.  If I had to do it over again while waiting for my son to start his program I\'d be doing PECS and the GFCF Diet.    I also don\'t know nor do I need to know your financial situation.  But I will suggest this in some states if you make to much to qualify for the typical medicaide programs they will sometimes have a different income requirement for medicaide for disabled persons.  Medicaide covers speech therapy and occupational therapy both of which you can start before and during ABA.  One or both of them should be able to help you with the PECS and/or signing with your little guys.  Also depending on your income they can qualify for SSI Supplemental Social Security it has helped us tremendously in the past when my hubby got laid off, but it takes three months once the application has been submitted so if you think you might qualify do that as one of the first things.  Another advantage to SSI is that in many states if you qualify for SSI you automatically qualify for medicaide.    It can seem like a daunting task but as they grow and learn it will get easier, getting some form of communication in place will be a huge relief for all of you.  It is hard and does bring you to tears I remember the feeling of being so lost and not knowing what to do.  Finding this forum for me was an incredible help I am so glad you found your way here and hope that it is at least as helpful for you as it has been for me.</div>'

It sounds like you have a good support network too, which is so important.     We had looked into sonrise as well in the beginning of our journey into therapies. My only concern at the time, and I may have had inaccurate information, but I was concerned that the child <em>has</em> to stay in one room for long periods during the day. I did like  a lot of the basic philosophy though.     The agency my therapists work for had them go to a weeklong workshop on sonrise a while back. I will ask them about their experiences and if they know any parents doing it, I will see if I can contact them and then I\'ll send them here.     Again, good luck!

' <div class=\"postbody\">Attending to my son\'s sensory needs is absolutely essential, and I have had a really hard time getting his school to understand that. I think I finally have them on board though.    MCA,    I don\'t understand why your very young child\'s sessions need to be so scheduled when he is working one on one with a therapist. This doesn\'t make developmental sense to me, and I don\'t think it is the best way for him to learn at this point in his life. Why not incorporate sensory activities in a planned natural way, instead of every 30 minutes we will do this activity, even if it\'s not what he needs or wants.</div>'

Jen I think this is a hard thing to determine, because it\'s so hard for them to demonstrate what they know sometimes.  We\'re currently retesting and the examiner is noting that sometimes when DS appears not to comprehend, it\'s actually a focusing issue, and once she can get his attention he breezes through certain receptive language tasks that he really looked like he had no clue on before.    But she\'s also noting that certain test questions have to be worded certain ways for him to access the information in his head, too, just like you are saying with the key words that Aidan needs.  Too many extra words and he just cannot focus, but cut it down to 3-4 key ones and he has less of a problem.    yesterday it looked like this:    examiner:  \"A dentist is someone who _________...\"  DS:  *blank stare off in distance*  examiner:  \"Dentists _______________...\"  DS:  \"fix your teeth.\"    When my kiddo was just turning 3 it appeared he had little receptive language but this same examiner determined the language was in there, there were just a lot of interfering factors preventing him from accessing it.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Call it selfish or shallow; it\'s the truth.</div>  I don\'t think it\'s either. I think that\'s just how the human heart works. We have to constantly battle so many things to get our kids to where they can progress. And other children do not need to do this. They don\'t have to be taught to say HI, to understand how to interact with others, to eat food rather than paint or dirt or paper.  I mean truly neurotypical kids are blessed with NOT having so much to deal with.  Our kids are not. It\'s not fair. It\'s not right. We have every right to be hurt, angry, sad and resentful. I think for our kids sake and for our sake, we have to try very hard so that that is not where we remain. But until we have a handle on some of it, we are entitled to do what we have to do so that each day is a little easier to deal with. If this means we no longer talk to certain people for a period of time- that is our right. And again, I would hope that we don\'t remain at that place for too long as it\'s not a fun place to be. But we do deserve to speak the truth without having to worry about how others will feel. Truly- this is our kids we are talking about. We do what we have to to make their lives and ours a little bit better every day.  If others can\'t understand that- then it is their right to not reach out to us when we are ready to start opening up to the rest of the world again.     Hugs to everyone who is going through this right now. I am brought to tears with just the memories of how devastating this part of autism was for me too. I\'m thankful it\'s no longer there, but it\'s a reality that many of us face and a memory that most of us can\'t forget. My thoughts are with you and I pray that the progress you see between now and next year will turn the pain you are feeling right now into hope and relief that your child will be okay.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Tami</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Tami</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Where did that article say she caused the autism?  I read it as being depressed and unable to deal with the autism, not causing it.    ETA:  Ah, I found it -- the thing about the wire monkey vs. cloth monkey.  I had skipped each time I read the story because I knew about the experiment already.      It seems like the author of the article was trying to find something science-related, some sort of study to include in the story for credibility.  Like he/she did 5 minutes research on autism for the article, found the monkey experiment from 200 years ago, and connected the dots in a ridiculous way.  (\"Aggressive, autistic\" monkey indeed.  That part alone made me realize this author didn\'t know what s/he was talking about.  Like autism and aggression go hand in hand.)    Stupid.      The rest of the article has nothing to do with the CAUSE of the autism, but including that monkey story certainly does imply it.  Way to miss the point.    I agree, including that monkey story and all the implications that come from that cast a bad light on the mother as not only killing her son but causing his autism.      Unforgivable on the part of the story\'s author.  Anyone up for a letter writing campaign?      I\'m surprised this author didn\'t do 5 minutes of research on women and depression and include a passage about an attack of the vapors or hysteria.      What is this article about?  Depression in mothers and how it affects children?  Depression in mothers of children with special needs?  Causes of autism?  Now that I break this article down, it is an atrocious mishmosh with NO POINT.  I am embarrassed I fell for it on the first few readthroughs.    If the author really cared about getting to the heart of this story s/he should have looked into WHY this woman would have been depressed to begin with, and WHY so many mothers are (ALLEGEDLY) just DYING to give their autistic kids to social services (which I don\'t believe.)    This poor family... first they have to live with autism in a world where bad is good and right is wrong and the ones you thought were the good guys really just don\'t care... and then after taking the ultimate leap of despair... getting picked on some more for what the depression might (or might not, notice it says a large % of kids from depressed moms have no problems) do to kids.  How the hell does the author know this kid was suffering from his mom\'s depression before this horrible event?      It\'s like the author got assigned this story about a lady who jumped and took her kid... started a story on depression... heard about the kid having autism... and scrounged together all the parts to make a fake story about why she jumped and why he had autism.  My conclusion first time reading this?  The mother was depressed from day one, caused the child to be autistic, then couldn\'t deal with what she created, and killed them both.    In reality?  That may have NOTHING to do with the truth.  Pretty big assumptions, I\'d say.       /yes this hit a sore spot with me    /off soapbox</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">We used a $29 model purchased from Academy Sports.  It was acceptable for our purposes and did last for several years.    A caution about using mini tramps inside though -- you really need enough clearance on all sides to prevent contact with other furniture, walls, toys, etc.  Injury is more likely to come from this than from the trampoline itself.  Since you already have an outdoor trampoline, you may want to decide if  the amount of space and supervision required for an indoor mini tramp is worth any potential benefit.     JMO, but <em>what</em> is in the therapy room will matter a lot less than <em>who</em> is in the therapy room.

He never doubted anything I was doing with him for a second. He really accepted Joey.     I would give anything just to have one day with either of them to just talk about him. I just never EVER imagined I\'d be dealing with this on my own w/o my parents. I do have a good husband, though, who will never leave us - I\'m lucky for that, but I panic sometimes that I will lose him also.    I wish my MIL was as interested.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi Starvin!  Jack has never been diagnosed with anything, although we\'ve been told he does have traits that are very Asperger-ish.  I believe in our case  that he does have it, it just isn\'t terribly debilitating for him--yet.  I am already seeing him have more trouble socially as he gets a little older, although he also makes strides all the time, so that\'s why we\'re just sort of \"on watch.\"  He has been reading and writing since he was 3.5 and as a Kindergartener he is reading and writing on probably a third grade level, but he still can\'t figure out which is the left and which is the right shoe <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\" />   Jack\'s movements have a couple of different looks about them.  When he is very happy he makes this facial movement- I can\'t even put it in words, but I guess it\'s sort of like his mouth and eyes open wide and his body does a little shake.  Sometimes when he is doing this he pulls his arms up to his side and clenches his fists, almost like he is angry- but it\'s almost always pure joy or boredom, there is nothing actually angry about it.  When he\'s really excited, he paces while doing the above.   He can be distracted while he is doing it .  He tells me he\'s \"thinking.\"  I think it\'s almost like a type of hyperfocus for Jack- he uses the pacing as a way to tune out the environment so he can think about his interests.    Jack also had an incredible interest in music- but listening rather than playing.  He could name classical composers I\'ve never heard of before.  He even has a page bookmarked of classical music!  At the moment his big interest is anything to do with movies/tv.  He writes episodes, plans out schedules, makes films around the house, etc...  Like Cameron, he has very little interest in toys. He will play with his brother or friends and toys, but he rarely seeks them out, and he\'s mostly doing it to keep them happy.  Jack is learning everyday how to be appropriately social with other kids, but it doesn\'t come as naturally to him.  He has \"best friends\" and loves to play with kids in the neighborhood, but he also likes to dictate their play.  I\'ve seen improvement, though, especially because as they get older the kids are less likely to just let Jack run the show.  He is concerned about feelings of others, but not as keenly as Cameron.  And that rarely applies to his brother <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" />     Jack had a lot of sensory issues re:sound when he was a bit younger. When we were doing OT we did a listening therapy that I definitely think made a difference.    It\'s definitely been an interesting journey with him.  He is unique and I feel so very protective of him. He some very special gifts, but not neccessarily the kind that are appreciated by 5 yr. olds. We are working hard on the social stuff because I have this fear that the tics are going to continue for a long time and probably soon the other kids will not be as kind about it.  Maybe if he\'s a great friend they\'ll be a little kinder about his eccentric stuff!  In the meantime I\'m here all the time trying to learn about the biomed stuff, which a lot of people with tics use.  I\'m sure his system is out of balance- so I appreciate learning about the options out there, as no pediatrician has ever been concerned with what\'s going on enough to address it.  And because he does have some behaviors that are spectrum-like, it\'s helpful to read about what others are doing.  I hope you stick around, at least for a little bit!

Alex sounds similar to Gabriel, in that his language is very limited and his social interaction is minimal.  Gabriel even sounds further along.      Anyway, I\'m responding to say that we get the biggest and most excited responses from Alex when we speak <em>his</em> language, i.e. repeat his phrases to him, even when we don\'t know what the heck he\'s saying.  I\'ve been doing this for a few weeks, while trying to teach him a few of <em>our</em> words and he is definitely remembering <em>our</em> words.  It feels like we\'re teaching each other our native languages - a cultural exchange, if you will.       Alex doesn\'t \"play appropriately,\" but I am beginning to embrace that, too.  For instance, he loves things that are the same, but in different colors, like nesting cups, Fisher-Price stackable rings, Teletubbies, The Wiggles.  He lays them out and turns them over, instead of stacking or using the figures to talk or whatever.  So instead of teaching him how to play \"correctly,\" I go along with what <em>he </em> finds interesting about these toys.  I look, now, for toys that have this characteristic, becasue it\'s what fascinates him.    As a result of my deciding to let him lead the way, he is blossoming socially.  His eyes are starting to follow his brother and the neighbor kids and he is starting to chase after them, as a little kid would normally do.  Alex and Noah even had a pillow fight the other evening, which brought tears to my eyes.  As I said in the other thread on vaccines (the nice thread,) we\'re pretty much intuitive \"accept the autism\"ers and ever since we went into high gear with this approach, he has responded in a big way.  He understands a lot more of what we say to him and he wants to interact a lot more with us and others.    He also goes to an ASD preschool every morning, so this is helping, too.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Fred, 7, NT  Barney, 5, autism</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Fred, 7, NT  Barney, 5, autism</div>'

You could give a sh*$ about parent\'s their children and whether or not they are empowered. You just want everyone to agree with you so that you can get what you want and what you feel like is the right way.    Come here and see if I\'m sitting on my haunches. I\'m not poo poing anyone\'s efforts. I fully support everything that a parent does to benefit their child. I simply find your judgement that parents that make different choices than you do are lazy, uneducated, resigned etc to be arrogant, ignorant and self-serving.    Let\'s be clear. It is definitely not my responsibility to agree with you. I am letting no one down by making choices that are right for me. I am always willing and ready to fight a good fight and take an active role in advocating for parents and children. You may find that no one wants to stand with you because you are less than inspiring.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Kayley, 5(NT)  Aidan, 3 (PDD-NOS)</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Kayley, 5(NT)  Aidan, 3 (PDD-NOS)</div>'

Numerous posts directed at me, accusing me of inflammatory posts, calling me out, and being, in general, unkind.<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif\" alt=\":o\" title=\"Surprised\" />     Patches, I am NOT HTRC.  I am \"chilliwackmom\".  Real name Danielle.  This is me and my little dog Sugar, who D loves dearly (it\'s mutual, she lives to make him smile).  Not sure what \"look\" you\'re referring to.  If you want to criticize my appearance, well, there\'s not much I can do about that.    <img src=\"http://www.hugabull.com/images/who05.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />    Here\'s another of D (face blurred for privacy - a rule until our adoption goes through on November 1st) and Gage, our male pit, who D has helped raise.  This was taken on our family trip to Prince Rupert this summer.  They had a wonderful time exploring the beaches together!  <img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v192/chilliwackpitbull/GageandDRupert.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />    Here\'s one with D, and all three dogs at the river, a couple of years ago (D\'s Dad is getting ready to chuck a giggling, squeeling D in lol ).  <img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v192/chilliwackpitbull/DSC01840.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />    I assure you, my son is in no more danger from our dogs than he would be if they were labradors.  I would NEVER endanger my child.  Yes, I made <strong>sarcastic</strong> comments about that, knowing the fierce reputation my breed of choice holds.  And I realize, that many folks on here, not having had any experiences with Pit Bulls, outside of what they hear and see in the media, will shudder to know that I expose my son to them.  For those who jump to conclusions, I ask you to take a moment, and open your mind.  How many of us have been judged about our parenting, about the fact that our children have autism?  How much misinformation is out there about this disorder?  Believe me, there\'s 10x the misinformation about Pit Bulls.  I won\'t go into it in length, as, as I\'ve said before, this isn\'t the place.  You can email me questions, or read all about them on my site.  I\'ll just throw out three small factoids to hopefully give some pause:    1. Pit Bulls routinely score as well, or better than, breed such as Golden Retrievers and Beagles on Temperament Tests designed to test, in essence, a dog\'s \"safety\" and \"stability\" in temperament. (<!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.atts.org\">www.atts.org</a><!-- w -->)  2. Petey, the cute little dog from the \"Our Gang\" show featuring the Little Rascals, was a purebred, registered Pit Bull.  3. One of the most decorated American War dogs, was a Pit Bull, \"Seargent Stubbs\", and WWI posters featured a Pit Bull on them, as that is the creature Americans most identified with.  They were proud of the Pit Bull, not afraid of him.    Yes, I love and work with Pit Bulls.  Yes, I wrote you one snotty post, out of my frustration and outrage at your callous and condesending attitudes towards the mothers on this board, many of whom I like and respect.  I acknowledged that, and deleted my rude (sarcastic) post.  Rather than moving on, you have continued your personal attacks on me.    I am ALWAYS logged in when I post, and thus always recognizeable.  I assure you, and everyone else here, I have NOT posted since Thursday morning.  I attended BAD RAP\'s Pit Bull Perspectives Conference in Oakland, CA this weekend - I left BC on Thursday afternoon, and returned this evening.  I had no internet access.  It was my first time visiting CA, and I had a wonderful (if busy) time.  I did miss my sweet little boy, D, terribly though.  I got home at 5:30 pm, and haven\'t seen him yet - he\'s out with his one-to-one worker, and won\'t be home for an hour.  I can\'t wait!:D     FWIW, anyone who\'s never been to the Bay Area, San Fran is BEAUTIFUL - Oakland is nothing spectacular.  The people were nice.  I don\'t recommend the Best Western in Jack London Square - poor service, and on the seedy side for a Best Western, IMO.    Patches, I\'m willing to bury the hatchet and start fresh, if you are.

This definitely applies to Gabriel.  If someone were to give him a verbally based intelligence test, I have no doubt he would appear to be retarded.

He figured out how to move an adult chair to a hallway in our apartment when he was 14 months old so he could climb up and play with the thermostat cover.  Shortly after he turned three, he figured out how to pick the lock on our bedroom door.  When he wants something, he works out a way to get it.  He knows how to ask for help, and he will if he is completely stuck, but he is fiercely independent and very clever.  So what constitutes intelligence, and by that same token, what doesn\'t?

' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi,  The orthodontist says my 16 year old son with autism needs braces.  Could any members who have had a child in this situation share their experiences and advice?      Chris has a severe overbite, such that the top front teeth are pushing on the gums on the front lower teeth, causing the root to be exposed.  This is also happening behind his top front teeth.  Also the orthodontist pointed out to me that he canâ€™t close completely down along either side of the molars.  For years weâ€™ve been cluelessly instructing him to â€œChew! Slow down and chew!â€ and now we find out he canâ€™t.    This has got to be a much bigger sensory issue than regular dental visits.  How has your child handled it, and how did you help him/her?   Iâ€™m wondering how we will get him to sit still for the full mouth x-rays and the impressions, as well as tolerating a mouthful of hardware for two to two and a half years.  He has always had a good experience with our regular dentist, though getting the bitewing x-rays has been challenging.  He\'s never had a cavity, but has done well getting sealants.    The orthodontist also said  we could opt not to put on braces, and he could simply make him a retainer to prevent things from progressing further. But would I be able to get him to wear it?   I\'m leaning toward going ahead with braces, because of the severity of his problems.          I look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks.    __________________  LynneD</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">My daughter had a difficult prenatal and postnatal period, and she was different from birth. She also had a big regression after 18 months. She falls into both categories (since birth and regression). She was seriously delayed across the board, and we heard only bad predictions from the doctors. We were told that most girls were severe and mentally retarded, because there had to be something really wrong with them to get autism, which affects mostly males.  Well, they were wrong! She\'s in middle school and working on grade level in a regular class although she has social problems and some behavior.  ABA helped the most. The mitochondrial cocktail and GFCF helped more than many of the DAN treatments.  One difference between boys and girls that I see at this age is that it\'s harder socially to be a girl with autism. Girls are expected to be SO social and chatty, and to understand these silly mind games that preteen and teen girls play! Did you see the movie Mean Girls?

Because he\'s scared and upset, not manipulating the therapist.  But to them, doesn\'t matter, which is not only ridiculous but cruel.

' <div class=\"postbody\">My wife and I let our son watch TV some after he works hard during the day.  His main shows are Baby Bumblebee videos (which emphasize vocabulary and show actual children talking and interacting) and sometimes *regular* kid-stuff (Barney, Wiggles, Blues Clues).  However, he also has a busy day for a 2 year old every day.  He goes to autism preschool class every morning for 2.5 hours.  He has speech 2 times a week for 45 minutes, occupational therapy 1 time a week for 45 minutes, and ABA 7 days a week for 2.5 hours per day (and an extra session on Sunday for 2.5 hours).  Additionally, my wife and I try to play with him, do books, interact during bathtime, etc.      What types of educational things are you doing now?  There are several approaches you can use.  We try to do some floortime (not necessarily Greenspan DIR, but play with a purpose nonetheless) with ABA.  I think combining purposeful play (i.e. let him do what he likes to do but get him to include you by doing it with him and inserting yourself) with structured worktime can be very effective in a program (whether class/center based or home based).  RDI (Relationship Development Intervention) is another effective approach that is parent centered and can have good results.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Gary - Cameron\'s Dad</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">You know, about a year ago I would have thought the same thing about the \"whiny moms\" who kept harping on the \"vaccine theory\" about autism.    And ten years ago as a childless teacher, I was angry about O.D.D., and thought it was a huge crock of c--- myself.      Now that I am part of this world, I am not ruling anything out with a \"gimme a break\" anymore.  There are things going on with our kids that sometimes defy common logic.  Each kid is an individual and I have no doubt O.D.D. is real for some of them.      I also don\'t think it can be cured with a \"he just needs a good smack in the tush and firm parenting\" attitude.  I know that\'s not what you\'re advocating... and your post actually made me nod my head a little with the \"hugely expensive psychologist thinking this one up\" line... but don\'t dismiss it out of hand just because it sounds odd.  It may not be.    Don\'t listen to anyone whose child has not gone through it when you decide to dismiss a particular diagnosis.  The NT families have no clue what it\'s like.    What site was it on?  I\'d love to check it out.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Hi all, I\'m new here, i\'m a member of many autism forums and it\'s always welcoming and a good source of \"everything\".    I have a daughter (7) in the spectrum. We are doing supplements and MB12 shots. We will be starting chelating in couple of days, i\'m so excited.    I have few questions,    Genetic test, i have heared from some people that a Genetic test has to be done before starting any supplements and treatments. I guess there are basic supplements you can do after seeing a DAN doctor. But especially before chelation you have to run the test to see if your child is COMT -- or COMT ++ to see what he can tolerate it. Or MTHFR mutation or methylation has to be checked through the test before any chelation. The reason kids with this mutation have a greater difficulty in detoxifying heavy metals. Has anyone of you done this test before? I have seen many children did well without any on these test, but will it be more effective to know?    Thank you all so much,     Jade\'s mom</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">As the OT here of course I have to chime in <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" /> Calming activities are different for every child as two other posters stated. When I do OT with ASD kids I always follow up any sensory activity with one that is calming. I watch a child\'s reactions to sensory input and if I see they are getting overstimulated I stop and change to a calming activity. I would never return a child to a parent like that consistently. Maybe the first few sessions this might occur until I got to know the child and was able to evaluate how different sensory stimuli affects their system. I would ask your current OT for a sensory diet that is designed specifically for your child that you can carry out at home. I would also mention to your OT that your child is leaving so overstimulated at the end of the session and that you would appreciate it if she could monitor your child\'s response to sensory input and spend the last five minutes of the session on an organizing activity. It may take longer than five minutes depending on your child\'s ability to modulate sensory input.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Laura Mom to: Caitlin age 8 ASD Maegan age 11 NT</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Laura Mom to: Caitlin age 8 ASD Maegan age 11 NT</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">What finally made me angry, was not injustice towards myself, because for a long time I thought I deserved it.</div>    I always felt that way too. I was taught to be like an NT (and do a fairly good job of looking that way most of the time), and needless to say when I couldn\'t meet the expectations I was pretty much led to believe that it was my own fault. Even though I know the truth now, I still can\'t quite shake that guilt.     What got me was working in a preschool where there were some autistic children interspersed among the ones enrolled. Now I can\'t answer for the severely autistic ones because I can\'t really get inside their heads, but for the higher end ones, I was pretty discouraged by what I saw. The kids were often accused of throwing temper tantrums when they would have a \"meltdown.\" Sometimes I would be able to intervene by taking them back to where they were when the problem started, and trying to transition them out. But then I would get chewed by coworkers  because \"he/she was just wanting attention.\" Now I realize NT kids scheme like that. I\'ve seen it. But autistic kids generally don\'t. Those meltdowns are terrifying so it doesn\'t stand to reason that they\'d do it for attention. As I expanded on in another thread, it\'s a response to an immense fear resulting from being snatched away from your zone of familiarity. Nonetheless I was discouraged by the fact that these people were supposed to be trained to deal with conditions like autism, and yet they were still missing this point. Even worse was the fact that they failed to take me seriously once they had pegged me as being autistic myself. And if it\'s going on in that one place, it\'s probably going on in a lot of other places too.     That\'s why I want to help autistic kids, because I just don\'t see enough being done right now, and I don\'t see very enough progress being made. I wish I could provide answers to some of the questions, since I myself am inside this \"bubble\" that NTs find so mysterious. But how to do it without finding myself in that situation again? That\'s the million dollar question.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ ~Nick    If it wasn\'t for sexual harassment in the workplace....

' <div class=\"postbody\">I\'d also eat organic whenever possible.   Though I stayed away from tuna steak and swordfish I did eat tuna fish and if I was going to get pregnant again (which I\'m not  <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"Laughing\" /> ) I would stay away from <em>all</em> fish and instead take an EFA supplement. I have no good reason to say this but I would drink and eat yogurt instead of milk. I guess because my son and my husband tolerate yogurt but not milk.    For my oldest, I strictly adhered to the pregnancy menu. I actually wrote down everything I ate and made sure I had had all the servings I was supposed to from all the food groups. There were nights when I would stay up to eat another serving of fruit, veg whatever because I was short one on paper and not hungry yet. For my second, Aidan, we were running around with a young toddler. Needless to say I had more chix nuggets and fries then I should have and less avocado and asparagus if you KWIM. So a long way of saying I would follow a very healthy  pregnancy and nursing appropriate diet.    I would also do an alternate vaccination schedule and if you need rhogam, which I did, make sure it is thimerosal free - which I think it is now.

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thanks for your responses, and thanks BTDT for the link to the book- this is great!    I guess I\'m asking my question because:    1) I think to be a good teacher you have to be fluid - and how can you be fluid if you\'re taking trial by trial data?  A tutor may do several consecutive trials of a target and keep a mental note of what was +/-, but unless this person has the memory of an elephant, how can you truly trust the integrity of the data?  Also, a probelm I have with +/- or Y/N data is that it doesn\'t give you info on the type/level of prompt the child needed to respond throughtout the sitting- nor can you see if overprompting is taking place.      I have always had these concerns since we started a home program, but as we go along, and as we\'ve changed data collection systems a gazillion time, I am beginning to wonder if it\'s at all possible to have a system that accurately reflects what went on during a session.    2)  Another issue I have is mand or request data and when people write mand targets.   Do we know for a fact that the child will want the targets ball, car, and chip?  And if we develop a list of targets in which we hit everyday, is the child not learning to label rather than to mand?    ex:  Tutor has a chip sitting in front of her and looks at child expectantly.  Child signs or says chip.  Did he really want the chip or has he learned that after mass mand trials that he is to \"ask\" or IMO <em>label </em>the item presented?  I personally don\'t consider this a true mand.  And even if several items are present and child \"mands\" for one item in the array, I still see it as a very contrived situation.  I may not truly want chocolate cake or seek to obtain it, but if there\'s someone in from of me with a platter of cookies, chips, and chocolate cake, and I am expected to make a choice, I\'d take the cake.  Does anyone know what I mean?  Do I sound crazy?    I was trying to come up with a decent data system, and a way in which to track language and just could not come up with any method that didn\'t seem like we were creating language targets for him rather than allowing him to determine these things based on what he wants in the moment - you know?    Jend, I have never heard of the HELP charts - could you explain?  thanks!</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">My daughter is 8 and gets most of her Pull-ups through Medicaid - we\'re in Iowa. (Thankfully, she is FINALLY starting to use the potty, YAY!)

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thanks for all the info...    My thought was to always keep my son home for another year and his behavioral therapist agrees with me.  We are trying to teach at home how to sit during certain activities for a certain amount of time without going all over the place.    I always had a hard time when my other NT children started school, im sure all parents do, but with my son-ASD its SO much harder. He cant tell me if something went wrong and thats my biggest fear. Im going to still look into the school, just to be able to know how it is. But ive been extremely blessed with the therapist i have now. So maybe ill be surprised and get a really great school. God knows we need the best for our children!    But i was looking into the whole \"school thing\" to see how else i can help improve his learning skills. My son is very aggressive and my fear is that he will hit on everyone when he gets upset.    have any of you dealt with that type of situation? is your child aggressive at school?     what about circle time and things in that nature, did your children have a hard time with things like that?</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Faith Moves Mountains!  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://recoveringmelquisedec.blogspot.com/\">http://recoveringmelquisedec.blogspot.com/</a><!-- m -->  Beautiful 3 y.o. boy-ASD</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Faith Moves Mountains!  http://recoveringmelquisedec.blogspot.com/  Beautiful 3 y.o. boy-ASD</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I am wary of any professional who won\'t show me any and all data kept on my child. There are laws here in the US that allow you to access your child\'s school file on request and get copies of anything in it. I would wonder whether they actually took good data. I can\'t think of any good reason not to show it to you. Since it\'s supposed to be a good school, I would talk with them again about it and perhaps ask in writing.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\"><strong>First of all, congratulations! Your son seems to have officially lost his diagnosis of PDD-NOS and picked up no new diagnosis in its place!</strong>    However, I did have some questions.    <div class=\"quotetitle\">Al&amp;Matt\'s Mom wrote:</div><div class=\"quotecontent\"> Because we still see \"quirks\" and his speech is still significantly behind,  we scheduled an evaluation  at the same center that dx\'d him.</div>    Did a speech-language pathologist evaluate his speech for delay? This should be done and if he has a delay, the school should provide speech therapy. Ask that he also be evaluated for pragmatic language problems. Speech therapy is more than just learning words. They also work on pragmatics (social speech) and social skills. I\'ve seen kids getting this kind of help at my son\'s school and these are not kids who have autism.    Also, I would want more details about the recommended behavior plan from this doctor!     Given his background of PDD-NOS, I think it\'s reasonable to push for an IEP in speech and behavioral issues as he makes the transition to school. If he doesn\'t need it an year, they can take it away then.</div>'

My son died years ago (1995) and my sister\'s best friend came to our house and I guess she felt she could \'help us\' get thru this with a little story (the day after we buried my son). I was sooooooooooooooooo upset with this woman as I stood there and listened to her tell me that \"Holland is Ok....., may be not where you planned to be but it\'s Ok....\" This story does fit with autism but boy it still brings chills when I hear it and remember the day after we buried our son and I had to listen to this for the first time and this woman trying to tell me \"it\'s ok.\" I wanted to strangle her but I was so polite and calm... UGH     I can still look at Bobby and love him and be with him and I want you all to know that if I had the chance to have my son Timmy in my arms as a vegatable I would take it.

We have seen much improvement in her since the beginning but she is still nonverbal.  She is GFCF and on MB12.      I have a younger daughter (18 months this week) scheduled for an evaluation on 11/17.  She is not quite like her sister but she is not pointing, doesn\'t usually respond to her name and doesn\'t use any meaningful speech.  I kept telling myself this couldn\'t happen again (especially two girls) but it is.  I know next week the evaluation team will tell me she has a strong chance of being autistic.  I knew this was coming but the closer I get to the date the worse I feel.   I just feel so sad.    We have been fighting so hard this past year to help my 3 year old.  We have pushed and pushed ourselves no matter how tired because it\'s for her.  No matter what the cost we want to help her.  Now I feel like it is happening all over again.      I\'ll pull myself back up and start the fight for both of them.  I just needed to feel bad for a moment and tell somebody.  It is not the kind of thing you talk to people about especially when most people don\'t understand.  Thanks for letting me vent.    Linda (Livsparents)</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">It could be the supplements or chelation. Chelation removes the good minerals as well as the bad, so some kids might get depleted in zinc, calcium or something else they need. Most people supplement with high doses of minerals during chelation, so I suppose there\'s a risk of over-supplementation in some kids?  My son got hyper on B and C vitamins.

' <div class=\"postbody\">How are you defining recovery?  My son isn\'t \"recovered\" but goes to a typical kindergarten, has friends, and varied interests and activities.  He still gets speech therapy for an expressive speech delay, has some sensory intergration issues and and is hyperactive.  Is he typical?  No, but isn\'t really atypical either, to most people, he\'s just very active kid that talks a little funny and can\'t concentrate.  His last diagnosis was ADHD with an expressive speech delay, two years ago his diagnosis was moderate to severe PDD-NOS with mental retardation, 10 months ago it was mild PDD with above average IQ.  I expect he will go to college, have a career, and friends.  I hope he will marry and have kids, but he is six and thinks girls are gross.      I\'ve met two kids who are recovered.  One is sixteen and his parents used ABA, he is very much a typical 16 year old boy.  The other one is 11 years old and his mom used biomed, traditional therapies, and karate.  He does stutter, but he seems quite typical.    My husband\'s family has several men that talked late, are \"shy\", and were a bit odd as kids.  None of these men recieved any therapies or interventions and they are all employed, married and contribute to society, but with in-laws typical is a relative term.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I have to chime in here as I seem to be one of the few to have had a life altering accident with my child.  He was run over by a riding lawn mower that my X was on.  23 surgeries later and most likely more to go.  I have to say that it only takes a second to change your life FOREVER!  I would very gladly go and have one of these monitors put on my son as he is great a dissappearing.  Just vanishes right before your eyes.  I am lucky to live on a small street and there are tons of kids can be as many a 20 of them at a time.  Do I ever get distracted with my other son or someone elses child (some people let little children out without supervision) so I help their children also it is not the kids fault.  YES I get distracted and David will quitely dissappear.  The adults that are out know to look right away.  We know where he goes and all split up quickly.  He will walk into the neighbors houses he is familar with get in my car or go in my home.  But what will happen when he decides that he wants to go somewhere else.  He does not answer to his name.  He can\'t tell you anything for that matter.  He has just turned 4.  I live in a kinda poor area and many people let children this age wander without supervision.  So strangers would not immeditally know something was wrong they would think he is just some unsupervised child.  I hope that with more skills he would not need it forever but at this point I have almost lost the child once and dealing with Delayed onset Autism is like loosing them I would not be willing to take the chance.  I am way to poor to afford the system but if I wasen\'t it would be the first thing on my list.  He can\'t get any help Dead.</div>'

It seems like she <em>may</em> say after the assessment that in order to have a really effective program he needs more hours, but that is different than <em>insisting</em> he have more hours which is how I misread it. Regardless of what the assessment says, start with the amount of hours you feel comfortable with and see what his ABLLS look like after the first whatever it is 4 months? Then you can reevaluate. I would go with your impression with her after meeting with her. I\'m sure it will work out fine.

' <div class=\"postbody\">It\'s really interesting for me to read these posts here. I never read so much content, which is equal to my situation and experiences.    I was also (non-sexually) abused in my childhood \'till I was 11. And before I was 26 (last year) no one applied the definition of the Asperger\'s Syndrome to my symptoms. I had to diagnose it by myself and then search for the corresponding experts, who were able to \"see\" what my symtoms are of.    Before that, I was also diagnosed with Social anxiety/phobia, ADHS (@justamom: This stands for <em><strong>A</strong>ttention <strong>D</strong>eficit and <strong>H</strong>yperkinetic/Hyperactive <strong>S</strong>yndrome</em>.) and Depressions. Well, the Depressions were correct, but they are secondary to my main diseases, which are, finally, Asperger\'s and <strong>additionally</strong> PTSS. From 1999 to 2006 I talked to so much psychologists that I can\'t remember all of them. But I always had the feeling, they couldn\'t understand me and, on the other hand, I had not the ability to communicate my problems and feelings to them in a way, that they would be able to get the full and authentic scope of my (inner) situation.    Because of this, I can only praise and encourage all the parents in here to continue there efforts in supporting their children so much. Alas, my mother wasn\'t able, albeit always willing, to do that very much, since she is rather very uneducated (and maybe also has autistic symptoms) and therefore simply not able to discuss with a doctor or so. I think, it would have been more easy for me to endure the difficult confrontations with all the therapists and doctors, if there had been a person who sometimes spokes for me or fights for my rights. To do that on my own is a double strain for me. Maybe I wouldn\'t have developed that much depressions, if I hadn\'t to cope all that on my own. -- Great job moms and dads. Don\'t give up, your children are always profiting from your efforts. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Very Happy\" />    First time I got professional help was when I visited an \"Autism Therapy Institute\" which was founded by parents of autistic children. They gave me the first adequate diagnose and where the first who really understood me. Note: They understood me, although I had not changed my (dis)ability to explain my problems.    Now, I\'m making the same experience, that the major amount of information is about children or juveniles with autistic syndromes. It seems to me, that, when you are passing the 18th, you are healthy by law or by definition. <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\" />    But I can only recommend to everybody to gather information and learn more about the syndrome by him-/herself. Especially by reading books. This will also help not to get confused too fast by what medical personal is talking. As a matter of fact, my advice would be, not to believe everything the doctors and therapists are saying, if it stands in contrast to the own feelings and observations. Since they very often don\'t know anything real about autistic syndromes or just symptomes.    I also began to study at college, but depressions get worse during the first semesters and made it impossible to me to progress in learning. Now, it\'s not sure, whether I will be able continue with college. It depends on whether I will get the right medicine for my depressions and the right therapies for my autistic and traumatic problems.    I can summarize my advices to justamom as follows: Don\'t trust in everything the doctor is saying, try to understand the symptomes by yourself (by reading books etc.), your son should also try to understand his symptoms, and the best would be, you find a therapist who is expert in autistic syndromes (but this, I know, is often not possible). Moreover, if available, you should get in contact with people or organizations, who are able to support you and your child, practically as well as emotionally.    But most of this may only be applicable, when your son is out of jail. I think it\'s really a terrible situation, that it has come so far, and I\'ve not enough English words to explain how sad I\'m about that. Although I often have thought about commiting a crime to get into jail to get away from the scaring society and to have peace and order all the day, I think in real it\'s everything but pleasant. So, I hope, he will be out as soon as it\'s possible. My Brother was also in jail (for three or four days) as a consequence of his schizophrenic disorder (before it was diagnosed properly) and he was not able to react adequate to the other inmates and the results where that they beat him up and treated him bad in many ways. Luckily, we could get him out after some days (he only had missed to pay a fine).    Best wishes so far  Markus</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ 27-year-old boy/man from Germany with Asperger\'s Syn., Post-traumatic Stress Syn. and Depression.</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ 27-year-old boy/man from Germany with Asperger\'s Syn., Post-traumatic Stress Syn. and Depression.</div>'

It\'s woth it.  <strong>AVOID BULLIES &amp; read \"PERFECT TARGETS\" </strong>  by Rebekah Heinrichs  Our kids can\'t cope with regular/nice kids let alone handling a bully. Just keep them away.  <strong>FIND GROUPS IN THEIR OBSESSION!</strong>  We found a science group in our area that covers geology and paleontology. Bobby would rather go there than anywhere in the world. To most this group would be way too boring but to him.. he can\'t wait for these meetings and field trips. We decided to do what Temple Grandin suggests and find what they are good at and go with it.  <strong>WILSON READING</strong>  If your child has dyslexia, this is good.

Although that child may have appeared \"retarded\" as you state he is probably times smarter and advanced than his \"normal\" same age peers.  Just because he may have been making sounds or jerking differently does not indicate his inability to love a pet or do anything.  Many Autistic people have a clear preference to animals over people and have a unexplainable understanding and connection with them.

[Small pictures of all our children]    Please help these and the ever growing number of children diagnosed with autism each year by spreading the word about <strong>ALL</strong> the treatments  available. Most parents are aware of the educational interventions available and these are important. However, it is so important that parents are also given information on the biomedical treatments available so that they can make the most informed decision possible for the future of their children.      Many feel that a combination of both educational and biomedical intervention could make the difference in their children reaching their fullest potential. Everyone at least deserves the information to be made available so they can make the best decision for their very precious children. I know you can help accomplish this. Please help us and the many more children out there.    [here I would add some links]    Thank you.

' <div class=\"postbody\">I was wondering, with Alex\'s fifth B-day coming up, how many of you are having \"traditional\" B-day parties for your kids. This is an especially difficult time, as it seems to bring every painful autie detail to the surface- lack of friends, incomplete understanding of a situation, lack of socialization skills, the disorganization and dysregulation that our kids may have in larger settings etc.   Here\'s our B-day history so far:  When he turned 3, we had just gotten the diagnosis and he had so little receptive and expressive language that at the time it seemed inappropriate to have any kind of party, so I spend the day feeling sorry and defeat.   When he turned 4 he was much more verbal and alert, but he still wasn\'t \"getting\" the concept, so he just got to open presents (prompted) and we took him to McDonald\'s.   This year he knows about birthdays, and even knows the date of his birthday, he expects a cake and presents (just told me this morning) and would probably love to go out (he always wants to go out). But he still can\'t tell me what he would like to get, and his attention span is too short for a sit-down or present opening ceremony. Any ideas on how to modify things and still have the semblance of a B-day party?  Alex\'s mom</div>'

SINCE THERE ARE FORUM READERS  WITH CHILDREN NEWLY DIAGNOSED I\'ll offer this first, from the Autism Research Institute:    <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal\">Advice for Parents of Young Autistic Children: Spring (2004), </span>written by Drs. James B. Adams, Stephen M. Edelson, Temple Grandin, and Bernard Rimland.     <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal\">http://www.autismwebsite.com/ari/intro/adviceforparents.</span>    <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal\">Regarding the link in your post about ASHA, this is the Response/Rebuttal by the Autism Research Institute (ARI) to ASHA\'s Working Group Report on Auditory Integration Training: <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.autismwebsite.com/saitwebsite/asha.htm\">http://www.autismwebsite.com/saitwebsite/asha.htm</a><!-- m --></span>    <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal\">Drs. Rimland and Edelson of ARI conclude:</span>  The ASHA Report, based on a selective misreading of six studies, is biased, incomplete, and highly inaccurate. We urge that it be retracted and that a new, more comprehensive and objective review be undertaken. In the meantime, since <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal\">there is abundant evidence from our review of 28 studies (see details below) that AIT is beneficial to many autistic children and adults, we urge that AIT practitioners continue to offer their invaluable AIT services. To discontinue the practice of AIT would clearly be inimical to the autistic individuals and their families. </span>    Dr. Bernard Rimland and Dr. Stephen M. Edelson\'s rebuttal to ASHA includes astute observations, specific criticism and valid questions that remain unanswered. Drs. Rimland and Edelson state their opinion that ASHA violated one of its standards of ethics by discouraging its members\' use of AIT. (There are ASHA members offer AIT because they believe it is in the best interests of those they serve.)    ASHA\'s working group report did not discuss that a 25% reduction in sound sensitivity was found in a 1994 study of 445 adults and children on the autism spectrum. The report summarized only 6 of 28 research reports and the summaries were missing important information.    <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal\">In response to your first question, â€œ are you a nationally certified audiologist</span>\": Iâ€™m an Auditory Integration Training practitioner, which is an educational training method. I am an early childhood educator with 20+ years background in working with ages 2-7. Most of the people I work with are young children who have the diagnosis of ASD. My BA degrees are in psychology and early childhood education. I have MA+ level certifications in Montessori education and other trainings, such as AIT, Irlen, and Brain Gym.    While some AIT practitioners are audiologists, SLPs, OTs, etc., many AIT practitioners are Master\'s level educators. Parents are encouraged to ask about the AIT Practitioner training of anyone they are thinking about hiring for AIT.    I believe that for ASHA to adequately comment upon AIT, it would need to demonstrate a greater desire for complete investigations before making recommendations (or veiled threats?) to its members. Were I an audiologist, I would likely join the American Academy of Audiology, which has a more open-minded and rigorous approach to such matters. Given what ASHA members tell me (reputable professionals who happen not to be associated with AIT), I am not surprised that ASHA makes only vague, misleading and intimidating statements in its 2003/2004 critique of AIT.      I have read the ASHA working group report many times and am troubled by the obvious efforts taken to intentionally mislead readers.    Those who are aquainted with all the facts will not find ASHAâ€™s report on AIT to be open-minded, fair, accurate, or complete â€“ which any peer review or report should be.    At the Autism Research Institute, information on AIT research can also be found:  <!-- m --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.autismwebsite.com/ari/treatment/aitsummary.htm\">http://www.autismwebsite.com/ari/treatm ... ummary.htm</a><!-- m -->  There are also current studies underway.

Edelson, Ph.D. and Bernard Rimland, Ph.D.</span>    â€œAuditory integration training (AIT), as developed by French otolaryngologist Guy Berard and based on the work of his predecessor, Alfred Tomatis, typically consists of 20 half-hour sessions of listening to specially modulated music over a 10- to 20-day period.AIT has been reported to be beneficial in several conditions, including AD/HD, autism, dyslexia, and hypersensitive hearing at certain frequencies.  The present review covers 28 reports on AIT.  Twenty-three reports concluded that AIT benefits various population subgroups, three studies claim to show no benefit (or no benefit over that seen in a control group), and two studies reported rather ambiguous or contradictory results. Considering the great difficulties in both providing a credible placebo treatment and assessing improvement in the subject populations, these results are quite encouraging. <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal\">The balance of the evidence clearly favors AIT as a useful intervention, especially in autism.â€ </span>The Summaries and Critiques continues at the link above.    <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal\">Dorinne Davis, who IS an audiologist, writes in her book about testing 259 clients for their acoustic reflex before and after AIT.</span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Sound Bodies Through Sound Therapy</span>. (Published 2004, available through Amazon and other booksellers.) Such testing is very difficult because of hypersenstivity, so many people with ASD cannot be tested. Ms. Davis works with many children with autism and special needs.     <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal\">Ninety-one percent of her clients made an improvement after AIT from either very low, low, or borderline levels to a higher level. 68% came up to fully normal levels.</span> <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal\">This work adds to what we already know from Drs. Rimland and Edelson\'s study of 445 people on the autism spectrum in Portland OR in the 90\'s. (The results ASHA failed to mention.) </span>It supports Dr. Guy Berard\'s premise (developer of AIT) that AIT is not only much faster acting than the Tomatis method, but that it has a distinctive influence upon the hearing function by retraining the acoustic reflex muscle.    You mention the issue of <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal\">insurance.</span> Clinicians are wise not to include AIT with medical-oriented billing since AIT is an educational intervention.      I hope this information is helpful. If you have further questions, I\'ll do my best, or refer you to others who can help.    Food for thought:    Berard AIT has been helping children and adults since Dr.Guy Berard, otolaryngologist, developed it in the 1960s!    Jeff Bradstreet, MD says, in Annabel Stehli\'s <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Sound of Falling Snow</span>, published 2004, available at Amazon, etc.:    \"We were barely introduced when the pediatrician-host (on a TV program) asked: \'So, if auditory therapy is so helpful for children with autism, why does the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) claim there is no evidence to support its benefits?\'    \"I suppose that was a fair question from the uninformed outsider\'s perspective, but it also begged the bigger question, \'How could the AAP miss the abundance of supportive data published, ranging from physician-authored medical textbooks to peer-reviewed publications?\" Certainly, we had gotten past the \'no evidence\' point of the evaluation by now.\"    Paraphrased from the collaborative works of the French scientist Jacques Bergier and journalist Louis Pauwels over 40 years ago: <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal\">Real discovery</span> in science, art, history, and psychology<span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal\"> begins</span> with an <span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal\">unwillingess to exclude facts outside of current theory or practice.</span>    AIT is a 10 day educational intervention that helps those diagnosed with Auditory Processing Disorders (APD), autism (ASD), ADD/ADHD, SPD and other learning disabilities to improve the quality of their lives and learning.    The AIT Institute provides Berard Auditory Integration Training information and free resources to families.   AIT  has over 30 years of scientific research and  28 clinical studies. AIT is an Educational Intervention. The AIT Institute does not endorse the billing of any insurance companies for AIT because it is an educational service.    The AIT Institute urges those interested in a medical diagnosis to seek the advice of a licensed medical professional.    <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.AITInstitute.org\">www.AITInstitute.org</a><!-- w -->   See the free Parent AIT Checklist  Join the free Parent Resource Group</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Jennifer Scoville, AIT Practitioner  <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.AITToday.com\">www.AITToday.com</a><!-- w -->, <!-- w --><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.AITInstitute.org\">www.AITInstitute.org</a><!-- w -->   (208) 899-0241 cell</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Jennifer Scoville, AIT Practitioner  www.AITToday.com, www.AITInstitute.org   (208) 899-0241 cell</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I have wondered from the begining how accurate is my son\'s diagnosis.  He\'s had several ranging from severe to moderate PDD-NOS with mental retardation (in 6/06) to selective mutism with social anxiety(05/05)  to Mild PDD-Nos or severe ADHD w/ expressive language delay (1/08).  How accurate are any of these labels?      Okay, I\'m done with my rant.  Did the diagnosis of autism change anything?  It did, because until then based on our family histories, we just accepted S.\'s speech delay as normal for him and didn\'t push interventions other than Floortime and some speech therapy.  After the diagnosis, I stepped up the Floortime from 30 minutes or so a day to 2 hours and had him tested for allergies, started the diet, found a good pre K program etc.      Janie, since your son is making such progress and is already receiving interventions, consider holding off, if you are comfortable with that. My son has made wonderful progress and we are finding it very hard to remove the label.  In January, he still met the criteria for mild PDD due to his refusal to engage in imaginary play with the doctor and his expressive speech and he kept talking about wanting to be a giant scorpion when he grows up.  Though, she expects him be off the spectrum by 8 or 9 years old.  Liz</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">I\'m wondering how often those opportunities are picked up on and scaffolded on. I bet not often. </div>      Alex\'s Mom, I fear you are right about this.  Having worked in the inside in both elementary and preschool settings, I can tell you that there are a great many occasions where I have seen children reach out to teachers and not be responded to in any meaningful way.  There a number of reasons for this.  Of course, there is the fact that you generally have many children that are demanding your attention.  (But if the person you are referring to is a one to one aide, then that cannot be an excuse).  Secondly, there are many demands put upon your time that go well beyond the duties and responsibilities of teaching.  This was one of the most frustrating aspects for me personally, as I was used to making the children my sole focus when I was still a college student and not completely in charge of a classroom.  Thirdly, there is pressure put upon you by outside forces to keep on top of meeting curriculum goals.  This is more true now as the No Child Left Behind Act has forced many otherwise creative and student centered teachers to become drill sargeants and task masters in an effort to raise standardized test scores or risk losing valuable federal money.  Lastly, there are unfortunately people who lack commitment to the children they are in entrusted with.  I went to college with many of them.  They did the work to pass the required course, but they never put their heart into anything they did.  They took the easy way out of everything-copied lesson plans verbatim from internet sites, relied almost exclusively upon teacher\'s manuals, etc.  They were not tolerant of children who could not meet their rigid demands, spoke of children they worked with in derogatory tones.      Pardon my own rant here, but I think I have been jaded a bit by my own experiences, and I know that there are wonderful teachers and schools out there.  I just have a very difficult time trusting anyone, knowing what lip service is sometimes given to parents, and then also knowing what sometimes goes on behind closed doors, and how children can be emotionally dismantled by teachers (even very experienced, well regarded teachers) who are clueless about the damage that they are doing.  Kids like ours, who have difficulties expressing themselves, are not going to be able to come home and relate to their parents what has happened and how they feel about it.   Okay, I hope I\'m not scaring anyone here, but if your child is happy and seems to be enjoying school then you probably have nothing to be concerned about, and even if he\'s not, it may very well be that it has nothing to do with the teacher or aide but is a result of the way the school day is stuctured and what the expectations are for the students.  If this is the case, and it\'s possible for you to work out a part time arrangement, then that might be the ideal solution.    Little Manz Parents, in answer to your question, I would check out your state\'s department of education website to start with.  Many of them have goals posted, and they may have both the abbreviated and extended versions available for the public to view. You can also generally get a copy of these from your local school district.  Just keep in mind that there are a bunch of bureaucrats sitting together in an office somewhere deciding what the most important things are for our kids to know, and these goals are sort of like the flavor of the month at Dairy Queen.  They are constantly being rewritten and revised and then rewritten again, and they have more to do with politics than with actual sound research into what a child should be capable of  learning at any specific stage in development, and of course they allow for absolutely no differences between individuals.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">The things you mention, LBP, have a lot in common with Floortime with well.  The basic premise is to go back to the beginning and help the kids fill in the \"missing pieces\"- the social things they would have learned as babies and toddlers if they were typically developing.  We are starting where Gabriel is, where his interests are and trying to expand them outwards, to make the tasks more naturally reinforcing from the beginning.  I think he would have a lot of fun with the \"jump game\" as he is generally very motivated by any kind of physical play.  I have often used tickling sessions or the mom-friendly version of roughhousing to help get him engaged with me.  He actually requests tickles from me when he needs to refocus.  I\'m not sure why it works, but it does.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</div>'

Unfortunately, DS wasn\'t feeling cooperative this morning and we couldn\'t get a blood draw for the test. Dr. gave us a letter excusing us from the DTAP for our purposes but it still doesn\'t address our current concern of his level of protection against Tetanus.

' <div class=\"postbody\">The good news here is that he sounds high functioning. With my son, when he was observed in his typical environment by a psychologist, she said that she sees some developmental delays, ADHD, a little OCD. When he was observed outside of his typical environment by a neurologist, he had no hesitation with diagnosing ASD. I had very mixed feelings and wasn\'t pushing for this at the time. My childs pediatrician reccommended that I go to the neurologist, after several bad office visits full of hiding, running away, and not talking, after getting hurt from falling and jumping. I guess my point here is, yes they have good days and bad days. Sometimes ASD is very apparent and other times it\'s not.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">but it als seems that any effort on the part of the child to connect and communicate should at the very least be acknowleged, if not highly praised. </div>  This comment sums it up for me.  It\'s not that I need to give him a huge sobbing mommy love-fest because he came up to me.  I want to be able to say to him what I say to my other child when she is supposed to be doing something else and she comes up to me for a \"huggy...\"  \"I love you very much sweetheart, *kiss,* and now you need to go do _____...\" and then I let her go.  If she tries to grab on again, I say \"I love you so much, but if you grab me again instead of doing _____ I\'m going to walk away from you.\"  And if the clinging occurs again, I walk away, I turn my back, I do the tough love harsh thing... but only after I am SURE she knows why and that I have validated our connection.  I have no problem with redirecting him or saying \"I\'m going to go in the other room until you ____________\" (whatever he\'s supposed to do) and THEN leaving, but I have to ACKNOWLEDGE and RESPECT that he is appealing to my love for him... whether he is trying to manipulate me, avoid a task, or WHATEVER.  If I <em>don\'t</em>, then to me, I am putting the task at hand above the fact he is appealing to our connection with one another.  His appeal has to be acknowledged.  There is nothing crueler in this world, in my opinion, than indifference.     <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Regardless of other skills that might be gained in time (which are certainly important to the child\'s future ability to gain independence and self sufficience), I feel that the connection is a core component that cannot be ignored. </div>  Part of the reason my son has come as far as he has is that I have immersed myself in his world.  I have researched him, observed him relentlessly (as well as spent a lot of time on this and other boards) and I KNOW him.  I truly feel I am his lifeline to the world, and without me, he\'d be about 200 times more severely autistic than he is.  So to me, the relationship between he and I is WAY more important than a single ABA drill, or any sort of compliance issue.    Then again, I could be wrong.  20 years from now maybe the ABA is what will make him a success.  I just don\'t know.    But I still do love my ABA supervisor.  We just disagree on this and we\'ll have to meet in the middle.</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">Being nonverbal can be beneficial since RDI stresses on nonverbal cues  and being verbal can be a hindrance.  Parents are asked to use less words and this can force the kid to look at you for cues.  For example, nodding your face rather than verbally saying yes/no will get more facial referencing.       A fundamental goal of RDI is to get your child to reference your face (the way a typical 1 year old  would do; so being non verbal is not an issue).  Since austistic kids typically lack this ability,  they miss out on lots of things like emotion sharing, referencing,  regulation etc.  For example, typical kids can get anxious in new places or situations but due to their automatic tendency to look at parent\'s faces,  they can quickly calm down and get regulated.  For autistic kids it\'s a meltdown time since they don\'t have this ability.       Age is also not a constraint.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">We don\'t use ABA, RDI or anything else in any formal way.  I think that it ultimately comes down to the practitioner and the parents along with the child\'s individual personality and development as to whether or not a program is effective.  That\'s not what parents of newly diagnosed kids want to hear, and it\'s certainly not the party line for a lot of \"experts\" within the autism community, but I think that if you spend any amount of time researching and talking with different parents, it is readily appparent that there is no magic bullet for successfully educating an autistic child (this is also true for non-autistic kids).      For my part, my son is learning and growing quite well without outside intervention.  He is thriving at home with his family.  Other children may respond better in more social environments or with the input of experienced practitioners.  It may come down to what the <em>parents</em> need in terms of support.  Some parents may be more relaxed with expert guidance while others (like me) will balk at having their child in the hands of another adult, and this will create feelings of anxiety and tension that might negatively impact the child.      Ultimately, we must all decide what is in our child and our family\'s best interest.  Despite what is suggested in the media and by certain practitioners, there is no solid evidence to support the contention that intensive ABA therapy leads to better longterm outcomes for all autistic children across the board.   I think it is far more important to choose the <em><strong>person</strong></em> who educates your child than to choose any particular program or another.  People in all camps can be inflexible and self-serving regardless of the method that they endorse.  Finding the right teacher(s) is essential, even if you discover that the right teacher for your child is you.</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ Jennifer, Mother to Anna, 5 (NT), Gabriel, 4, Autistic</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\"><div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Holland Schmolland by Laura Krueger Crawford  If you have a special needs child, which I do, and if you troll the internet for information, which I have done, you will come across a certain inspirational analogy. It goes like this: Imagine that you are planning a trip to Italy. You read all the latest travel books, you consult with friends about what to pack, and you develop an elaborate itinerary for your glorious trip. The day arrives.  You board the plane and settle in with your in-flight magazine, dreaming of trattorias, gondola rides and gelato. However when the plane lands you discover, much to your surprise, you are not in Italy --- you are in Holland. You are greatly dismayed at this abrupt and unexpected change in plans.  You rant and rave to the travel agency, but it does no good. You are stuck. After while, you tire of fighting and begin to look at what Holland has to offer. You notice the beautiful tulips, the kindly people in the wooden shoes, the french fries with mayonnaise, and you think, \"this isn\'t exactly what I planed, but it\'s not so bad It\'s just different.\" Having a child with special needs is suppose to be like this --not any worse than having a typical child -- just different.  When I read this my son was almost three, completely non-verbal and was hitting me over one hundred times a day. While I appreciated the intention of the story, I couldn\'t help but think, \"Are they kidding? We\'re not in some peaceful country dotted with windmills. We are in a country under siege --dodging bombs, boarding overloaded helicopters, bribing officials -- all the while thinking, \"What happened to our beautiful life?\" That was five years ago. My son is now 8 and though we have come to accept that he will always have autism, we no longer feel like citizens of a battle torn nation. With the help of countless dedicated therapists and teachers, biological interventions, and an enormously supportive family, my son has become a fun-loving, affectionate boy with many endearing qualities and skills. In the process we\'ve created... well ... our own country, with it\'s own unique traditions and customs.  It\'s not a war zone, but it\'s still not Holland. Let\'s call it Schmolland. In Schmolland, it\'s perfectly customary to lick walls, rub cold pieces of metal across your mouth and line up all your toys end to end. You can show affection by giving a \"pointy chin.\" A \"pointy chin\" is when you act like you are going to hug someone and just when you are really close, you jam your chin into the other person\'s shoulder. For the person giving the \"pointy chin\" this feels really good, for the receiver, not so much -- but you get used to it.  For citizens of Schmolland, it is quite normal to repeat lines from videos to express emotion. If you are sad , you can look downcast and say, \"Oh, Pongo.\"  When mad or anxious, you might shout, \"Snow can\'t stop me!\" or \"Duchess, kittens, come on!\" Sometimes, \"And now our feature presentation\" says it all.  In Schmolland, there\'s not a lot to do, so our citizens find amusement wherever they can. Bouncing on the couch for hours, methodically pulling feathers out of down pillows, and laughing hysterically in bed at 4:00 am, are all traditional Schmolland pastimes.  The hard part of living in our country is dealing with people from other countries. We try to assimilate ourselves and mimic their customs, but we aren\'t always successful. It\'s perfectly understandable that an 8 year old from Schmolland would steal a train from a toddler at the Thomas the Tank Engine Train Table at Barnes and Noble. But this is clearly not understandable or acceptable in other countries, and so we must drag our 8 year old out of the store kicking and screaming, all the customers look on with stark, pitying stares. But we ignore these looks and focus of the exit sign because we are a proud people.  Where we live it is not surprising when an 8-year-old boy reaches for the fleshy part of a woman\'s upper torso and says, \"Do we touch boodoo?\" We simply say, \"No, we do not touch boodoo,\" and go on about our business. It\'s a bit more startling in other countries, however, and can cause all sorts of cross-cutural misunderstandings.  And, though most foreigners can get a drop of water on their pants and still carry on, this is intolerable to certain citizens in Schmolland who insist that the pants must come off no mater where they are, and regardless of whether another pair of pants are present.  Other families who are have special needs children are familiar and comforting to us, yet are still separate entities. Together we make up a federation of countries, kind of like Scandinavia. Like a person from Denmark talking to a person from Norway, (or in our case, someone from Schmenmark talking to someone from Schmorway.), we share enough similarities in our language and customs to understand each other, but conversations inevitably highlight the diversity of our traditions. \"My child eats paper. Yesterday he ate a whole video box.\" \"My daughter only eats four foods, all of them white.\" \"We finally had to lock up the VCR because my child was obsessed with the rewind button.\", \"My son wants to blow on everyone.\"  There is one thing we all agree on. We are a growing population. 10 years ago, 1 in 10,000 children had autism Today the rate is approximately 1 in 250. Something is dreadfully wrong. Though the causes of the increase are still being hotly debated, a number of parents and professionals believe genetic predisposition has collided with too many environmental insults -- toxins, chemicals, anti-biotics, vaccines -- to create immunological chaos in the nervous system of developing children. One medical journalist speculated these children are the proverbial \"canary in the coal mine\" here to alert us to the growing dangers in our environment.  While this is certainly not a view shared by all in the autism community, it feels true to me.  I hope that researchers discover the magic bullet we all so desperately crave. And I will never stop investigating new treatments and therapies that might help my son. But more and more my priorities are shifting from what \"could be\" to \"what is.\" I look around this country my family has created, with all it\'s unique customs, and if feels like home. For us, any time spent \"nation building\" is time well spent.</div></div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Back in Jan and Feb when Luke was having the worst tantrums, I found the behaviour modification consultant that we are now seeing once a week...what she did was to teach him about \"calm\", her rationale made complete sense to me...he did not understand what behaviour we were actually looking for so every time he was happy and calm, we made a comment like \"I like how CALM you are now\"...or \"Luke you are CALM\"...then when he was in the middle of a tantrum, we would say \"CALM Luke, you must be CALM\"...it seemed like such a simple thing to do once we learnt it, and we still use it now....sometimes when Luke is playing a video game he will get upset and we just switch off the tv and say \"Luke, when you are CALM we can turn it on again\"....he calms down very quickly...it is a statement that we make, he can tantrum and be upset and that\'s ok, but he does not get to continue the activity...when he is calm he gets to continue and the tantrum stops in a couple of seconds....it\'s really effective.  I\'d therefore have to say change the goal from one about tantruming to one about learning what it is to be calm and being able to redirect himself from a tantrum back to a state of calm within a specified time (eg: \"DS will be able to bring himself to a state of calm from a state of tantrum within 1 minute, with minimum verbal prompting from caregiver\".</div>  <span class=\"postbody\"> _________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>_________________ LindaC  9 yr old NT  6yr old ASD</div>'

It is an affiliation of The Boling Development Center here in Memphis. It is suppose to be a really great language based school for kids up to age three. I don\'t know how old your child is. After age three, I think that they have the option to stay on for a 4-5 yr old program. Any child with a learning disorder will qualify for treatment through EI through the state of TN up to age three. (cost after 3 is something like 200 per month)It takes about 3 months to get in right now. There are also other learning based preschools around this area that are really good. Mostly associated with the medical centers and children\'s hospitals in the area. Waiting times can be difficult though. I also know that the U of Memphis has alot of grad students that look for one on one teaching jobs with developmentally challenged kids to get experience. Alot of people have had good things to say about this. I hope all this helps.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">I think the distinction for us was that the tantrums were the only form of communication for him.  He didn\'t grow into other forms of communication like pointing or reaching or talking not even baby talk.  They looked like typical tantrums.  The one other difference was that he would have tantrums in the middle of the night.  I finally figured out that he got extremely painful gas which cleared up with the GFCF diet but none of my kids had middle of the night temper tantrums (and sometimes after his naps.)  But yes it can be a grey area what is typical two year old temper tantrums and what is autism temper tantrums or is there even a difference?  Is it just all a form of communication that autistic kids have a harder time growing out of because they tend to be behind in communication so they keep having them after a typical child will learn to use new forms of communication?</div>'

Then gently mention there\'s Early Intervention/0-3 programs (assuming the person is in the USA) that can help with such issues at no cost to the parents, give the phone numbers for such organizations, let her know you\'ll be there for support and help, and leave it at that.

Being smart can mask or take the attention away from the autistic symptoms to a certain degree especially if you dont see the child with peers. This is a quote from Autism answer     <div class=\"quotetitle\"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class=\"quotecontent\">Children with autistic type behavior have often been described as exceedingly intelligent, even to the extreme point of being considered savants in particular areas. Dr. Tsien and his collaborators have demonstrated a correlation between glutamate receptors and superior ability in learning and memory. By overproducing a component of one of the glutamate receptors they were able to increase the level of glutamate binding. This was the first demonstration of a relationship between increased glutamate/glutamate receptors and higher intelligence. The down side of the enhanced level of glutamate was an increased risk of stroke and seizure activity. This work suggests a potential correlation between intelligence and glutamate levels. It also points to the potential increased susceptibility to excitotoxin damage due to excess glutamate/glutamate receptor activity as a consequence of enhanced intelligence.  </div>    My son will be 4 in April, when he was 18 months old he knew the alphabet, could count to 10 - obsessed with letters and numbers, had extreme tantrums if things didn\'t go his way, had extreme oral sensitivities  and other texture sensitivities, went from uninterested in other kids to actively aggressive.

Not super hard or out of anger but almost out of curioristy.</div>     Hi HelloMommy,  We have had (comes and goes) similar issues with our little guy.  In our case, Little man is more likely to squeeze and bite another child out of excitement.  When this first started, back when he was between 12 mos and 20 mos, and had no language, it became clear that it was his way of \"greeting\" new kids and expressing his excitement.  It helped for us to pay attention and beat him to the punch - so if I saw him with that \"look\" in his eye and he started to approach another kid, I would take his hands (HOH) and help him to gently touch the other child, giving him words like \"Hi Friend!\"  Over time this did seem to help.  Of course if he is overstimulated these things still creep up from time to time, and I still handle it much the same way (with regard to other kids).  The tricky part is that we can\'t always anticipate the behavior and they\'re always throwing us curve balls!     Maybe (just thinking out loud here) next time you can take him over to the children he sees up front and help him to say hello (in his own way, even if it means you use the words and help him to wave).  And this might sound completely ridiculous, but maybe taking along a small bucket so that you can redirect him to throwing rocks into the bucket as a game... and/or a baggie full of cotton balls that he can safely throw wherever he wants?</div>'
' <div class=\"postbody\">I\'m not sure if my teachers ever mentioned about autism to my parents during the meetings in grade school. Since my parents refused to sign the papers, I didn\'t get any help and I was trapped in the world of autism being alone and scared. But most of my grade school teachers wrote about their concerns in my school record.     In 6th grade, my teachers sent me to get tested by the school psychologist. After I got diagnosed with learning disability and a severe language delay, my parents had no choice but to sign a paper to let me be in a special program. The school work I did was modified, which made me feel relief but it angered my dad.     After I got tested for language skills at 14, the results said my language and English speaking level was like a 6-year-old child! I still couldn\'t write or read correctly to save my life at that time. But I started to improve at 15. And I got better and better each year. It was a miracle that I overcame many obstacles to be able to read, write, and speak correctly. Now I have no problem with communicating or making friends but I\'m still not good at socializing.    If you\'re worried about your son not getting a job in the future, you need to check if there\'s a special service in your area that helps an autistic get a job. Since I\'m still not officially diagnosed, I can\'t get help from the special service. I did so bad on my first day as a cashier in the food service at the amusement park that I got fired. My supervisor and the customers were pretty nasty to me for not doing the job correctly. I couldn\'t do the job correctly because I couldn\'t everything in my head at once and everything was scrambled in my head.     It\'s up to you whether you want your son to be labeled or not. Here are the pros and cons I had to deal with dealt with in high school for being labeled.     Pros:  When the good teachers knew I had special needs, they would help me to get further and be successful. They were compassionate. They would check on me to see if I was on the right track. They would even give me an extension on school work.      Cons:  Unfortunately, the special program in my high school was corrupted. The special education staff tried to take advantage of me and other students. They forced us to be in low level classes, so they could keep their jobs because if there were lesser or no students in the program, they would get laid off.    When some teachers knew I had special needs, they judged me so quickly as if I was a mentally disabled person who couldn\'t do anything. When they saw my great performance on writing, they thought I had help or someone wrote it for me. It upset me so much that they didn\'t believe I did so well.    Each year, I had at least 2 teachers that didn\'t want to deal with a student like me. I was discriminated many times. I had some teachers yelling at me for no reason. They didn\'t like it when I wasn\'t clear on an assignment that they expected me to understand everything quickly. I guess they were yelling at me for being in their classes where they didn\'t think I belong.      The teacher I hate the most is my math teacher in senior year. He was nice and friendly to his excellent students. He treated everyone alright except to people like me. Since he\'s a funny person, people would think he\'s a good person. But he\'s not a good person once you see his true colors. He yelled at me for being lost or doing things incorrectly in front of my classmates. He would tell my classmates that I got an F in his class just to embarrass me when he should have known I wouldn\'t like that. I believe he ranted about me many times to my classmates and the special education staff when I wasn\'t around because I could tell by looking at their expression. And he said \"I hate dumb kids\" to his students.</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Eden,  I\'m so sorry. Every now and then I get that panic and overload and I get a bottle of wine, let my DH take over with the kids and cry my eyes out. I have had to do this once since Bobby was diagnosed and I can\'t say it helps but the hangover the next day gets your mind off of everything that\'s for sure!     Over the summer we had a cub scout summer day camp. The boy scouts ran the camp and some helped those kids that couldn\'t hold the BB guns or do archery well. I guess the boys scouts helped the kids so they earned the patch or whatever it was. The leader of our den accused my son of not earning his patches or whatever they gave (honestly I could give a darn about the patches unless he feels left out). I\'ll never forget her saying in such a condescending tone, \"Bobby is a smart guy right Audrey? He knows he didn\'t earn that... He\'s a smart boy right, he figured it out, he knows, you know he didn\'t earn that...\" I was crushed. I kept thinking, she KNOWS he has asperger\'s, she\'s seen him react to things and she knows he has muscle tone problems. Her son has ADHD. If she can\'t understand then who will??     I remember too after I had a brain tumor removed. It was about a month after I was allowed to drive that I took Bobby to get shoes and I wanted a pair of flats that were comfortable (still had vertigo). Bobby was running around and just hyperish. THe sales lady embarrassed me in front of all the customers telling me, \"control your kid.\" I didn\'t even know he had asperger\'s and I still had vertigo from the surgery (brain getting used to one ear) and I couldnt\' tell where he was in the store because I\'m deaf in my left ear. She kept stairing at me to \'get him\' and I could hear him but didn\'t know which way to go. I just didn\'t feel like telling this young girl and her customers I had a tumor and I\'m not quite right and my son is hyper.... Finally, I found my son. The worst thing is that I had to get the shoes. I needed both pairs so bad and was exhausted from getting out of the house that I didn\'t want to start all over. It was humiliating and belittling to stand in line and try to keep him still and fight the vertigo which was now far worse...     I wish there was an awareness out there to be more understanding to each other. Seems like our society forgot what kids are like too and I\'m talking NT kids let alone children with autism.     I\'m with Respect on this one, I wish I was there to belt the lady for you! You did such an awesome thing delivering that card to her. How smart! Where did you get that card? I\'d like to have one or make one up. What did the lady do? Did you see her reaction at all????

' <div class=\"postbody\">Dear Anita and all,    1.  I\'m very new to this forum. I\'ve a son of 23 Months old. After reading the red symptoms of this site, I think he has got autism. He walks on his toes, he doesn\'t respond if he is called with his name. But he has got some tv ad.s and some cartoon cds like animal alphabet of his own choice. Once he hears the sound even he is not in the room, he comes running and starts dancing, while he watches them. He has got some poetrys of his own choice, once he hears them for his mon, he jumps into her and starts adouring her. He likes the bouncy ball of msn messenger very much. If he sees that he come near me and climb up to my lap in the chair and try to use the mouse of the computer.    2.  Above all are the activities he does. About meal he like dry food very much. He is living on noodles and some time a small amount of milk thats all. He likes only orange juice and banana. He does not accept any thing else.    3.  Please suggest me what should I do with him. I\'m married only 4 years and we are very happy couple.    4.  I\'ll be very greatful to you all. I\'d appreciate quick response from you all. We are quite frustrated.    Armanbd</div>'

' <div class=\"postbody\">Thought I\'d post an update:    D\'s doing smashingly well at the new school, although very part time (like an hour or two per day), as there\'s not been a TA yet.  They just hired his secondary TA (the person who will fill in while his main TA takes breaks), and she starts tomorrow.  She is apparently, young, energetic, enthusiastic, experienced, and has ABA experience.  Yipee!!!  His primary TA should be hired by the end of the week - although I have to contact the district and formally complain, as they knew D was moving schools as of Nov 2nd, and didn\'t even POST for the new TA until Dec 2nd!!!  What we\'re they thinking?!!!  The good thing about the primary TA is that the district is trying to make D a test case to bring in new regulations around TAs for children with autism.    Currently, the requirements to be a TA are the only requirements, are universal, and then seniority takes over.  So the requirements to work with a child mildly affected by dislexia for example, are the same as the requirements to work with a child with severe health issues, are the same as a those to work with a child like D.  Not exactly the best system.  The District has examined the fact that it is \"best practice\" for children with autism to be supported by people who have experience in a wide range of teachign modalities, including ABA.  Based on this, they have written into the posting for D several extra criteria, including the need for ABA experience.  Here\'s hoping!!!    Our ABA curriculum is developed, we\'re \"trained\", and now we just need to put it together and implement it.  I\'m pretty excited, as is the ABA company.  They were surprised by D\'s assessment results, as they are more similar to a NT child with delays than the typical child with autism.  Generally, children with autism have large learning gaps, and many \"splinter skills\".  Children with delays have less gaps, but are just kind of globally behind.  D doesn\'t have many gaps.  The bottom of the bars on his charts are all filled in.  He is more behind in some areas than others, but he has a strong foundation.  Also, there are some areas (lifeskills) where he is on par with, or surpasses his peers.  That was an eye opener, because it tells me that, even if D doesn\'t \"recover\" as we hope, he has the skills NOW to live a semi-independent life as an adult, work in supported employment, etc.  Very exciting!  Our curriculum really addresses primarily attending, actually LISTENING to people and responding, and conversation skills.  I\'m very excited about that, as I can now see a path to helping D achieve normalcy in conversation, which he clearly desperately seeks, and I couldn\'t before.      Now for the disturbing news:    There have always been questions about D\'s mental health, and we have questioned whether he\'d wind up with Schizophrenia as an adult.  We\'ve also occasionally wondered whether he had Dissociative Identity Disorder (Multiple Personality Disorder), based on some behaviors that come out when he\'s fully escalated (tantruming).  This is not uncommon among children who\'ve experienced horrific abuse and neglect such as D has, and is usually comorbid with other conditions.  I would think it would be \"easier\" for a child with autism who experienced trauma to develop DID than a NT child, as there is already a lack of connectivity to self and experiences.    We\'re fairly certain D is mildly-moderately affected by DID.  On Thursday, he was having a really tough day, not himself all day (he sometimes wakes up inexplicably grumpy, lots of self-talk, lots of jargon on these days).  At the pool, for the first time ever, he had a melt down in the water (screaming and shoving his face into the water), and I had to remove him.  He was beyond speech, in a full tantrum, so I gave him as little eye contact and as little verbal direction as possible, and got him dressed.  His dad came into the change room, spoke to D, and D was shocked to see him, and suddenly \"fine\".  Dad left, we went out to the car, and D sort of changed again.  In the car, he suddenly began using bizzarre jargon that I\'ve never heard from him.  His voice was raspy, and it sounded like speech sounds, but a different language.  He sounded angry.  I kept asking him to repeat what he\'d said, using words, and he would just do the jargon again.  I was using his name this whole time.  Suddenly, he whipped around in his seat, looked me full on in the face, and his facial expression changed.  In this bizzarre voice, he yelled, \"Not D.  I am Gromit.\", I stayed calm, and said, \"I don\'t want to talk to Gromit.  I would like to talk to D please\".  He repeated his dissent again, then sort of slumped over silently.  As we pulled into the driveway, I was trying to talk to him about what had just happened, and he seemed confused, with no recolection of it.  He was \"off\" for the rest of the day; alternately grumpily non-communicative, and seemingly unaware and bewildered.    Initially, I\'ll admit, I was creeped out.  But then I thought about it and realized that, if I was in fact talking to \"someone else\" in the car, that someone was a younger, more autistic, very (justifiably) angry and hurt little boy.  Hubby and I talked, and our gut feeling is that what\'s going on is that when D was abused and neglected, he was so traumatized that he couldn\'t go on.  At that point, there was a consciousness break: the part of him that was traumatized stayed as it was, while a new consciousness, free of this trauma, developed and continued on, enabling growth.  I really, really think this is what happened, in my gut.  So the \"person\" I was talking with is not to be feared or repulsed by, but loved and pitied.  I also felt, instinctively, that the only way to help D get better is to get in touch with this other \"self\", promote awareness of it, and work towards healing it.    I did a lot of reading last night (after I\'d thought of all of this), and it turns out my assumptions/instincts are right on the money.  Armed with my new knowledge, I decided to explore this idea a bit more with D last night.    I went and sat with him (he was in a fantastic mood all day), and wrote/drew out a social story, which he loves.  In the story, a little boy named Samuel was hurt over and over by grownups.  He went to another home and more grownups hurt him.  Samuel used to go away when grownups were hurting him.  One day, Samuel went to a new home, with nice grownups who didn\'t hurt him.  Samuel was happy in his new home, but still has other people inside of him, who had been hurt by grownups, who were angry/sad/hurt.  I then drew Mom, and Dad, and D, with big empty tummies, and put a small person in mom\'s tummy, a small person in Dad\'s tummy, and left D\'s empty.  I then did two boxes, one with a small person \"D\", and another with two small people, \"D\" and \"Angry boy\".  I asked D which one goes in his tummy.      During the story, he\'d become agitated and avoidant.  He turned his back to me fully, avoiding eye contact.  His face was, from what I could see, blank, somewhat trance-like.  When I asked the question of D, he was avoidant, and seemed agitated and confused.  I wasn\'t clear at all whether I was right in my suspicions or not at that point.      I asked D to choose between shower first or clean room first, since it was that time of night.  He chose clean, and seemed cheerful and compliant.  This is where it got weird.  D was alternately singing happily, and grumpy and protesting in a very angry tone.  His facial expression and voice tone would change, and he seemed completely unaware that this was happening.  At one point, when in the angry mode, he looked at me and said \"I\'ll kill you\", something he hasn\'t said in two years, and then only when very, very agitated (full blown tantrum).  Whenver I asked something of him that required a thought out verbal response, there would be a scowl, followed by a sort of clouded look, then a confused uncertain smile and the response.  I\'m CERTAIN now that I was talking with two different \"selves\", one who is barely verbal and highly autistic, and the other who is my sweet and cheerful D.  I KNOW that D doesn\'t know about this and I don\'t *think* the other part of him does either.    So now I have to think long and hard about whether I want to push for a diagnosis, or just go ahead and \"treat\" him.  I suspect a doctor will be unlikely to diagnos D because the autism makes it really hard to see what\'s truly going on, unless you really, really know him as we do.  Treatment consists of promoting awareness of the various consciousness, and encouraging intigration.  While DID can be severe, it has one of the best prognosis for treatment of all the mental health disorders.    What do you all think?</div>'
