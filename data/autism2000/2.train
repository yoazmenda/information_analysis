'jonsdfca -What size class did your son have in preschool? If his preschool IEP requires a smaller class size, they have to explain (in writing if you request) why they have upped his class size. In term of benefit to him, not in terms of whether or not they have an appropriate class in the school. They must FIND an appropriate class if putting him in the kindergarten with the all the kids is not \"reasonably calculated\" to enable him to make \"more than trivial progress.\" This is what the law says. If you believe he will not progress at all in his proposed placement, you can go to Due Process and make a case that the District is setting him up to fail. Read your Due Process Rights - the school MUST give every parent at copy at least once a year.'

I haven\'t really settled down much mostly because I need the fresh start over and over.

One of the bands I played with (of which my brother was also a member as a drummer) did do fairly well locally, playing gigs on and off for about 2 years. We broke up when our frontman decided to go solo, essentially ditching us in the process. <br /> <br />I do get taken advantage of and misunderstood a lot on the job, and that\'s one reason why I have never kept any one job more than about 2 years. This school-teaching experience that I\'m dealing with right now has been absolutely horrendous for me from all aspects, and I have been in almost continuous overload for the past 3 months. My separate lives in my hometown (where my family lives), and my college town (where I have some close friends), serve as escapes for me on weekends and scheduled breaks. I will leave teaching behind in less than a week, and focus solely on my other 2 \"lives.\" I will seek to find employment and stability in one place, while using the other as an escape and a crutch. I\'m not yet sure which town will fill which role, though. After I\'ve had a few weeks to recover emotionally, I will proceed to figure that one out.<span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by stickboy26 on May 25 2007 at 9:21am</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>-   ~Nick   Still in touch with my inner child ;)</div>'

'Niki, <br />My son is in Kindergarten and he will turn 6 on Sunday. He is not the <br />oldest one in that class by the way. He is only in a half day Kindergarten <br />and believe me he has been in an intense ABA program for some time. <br />He still is getting used to the demands that are placed upon him at <br />school. He has to process everyting so much faster. Its pretty fast paced. <br />I have noticed a lot more inattentiveness and zoning out. We are <br />tweaking his home program a bit to get him used to the pace of school <br />and all the distractions that it entails. Without the supports that my son <br />gets, I think he too would be a mess.

He will attend the regular classroom for circle time, recess, and specials (art, music, gym, etc) and this class will be his \"homeroom\". He will spend the rest of the time in the autism classroom. Our school district does not use ABA in the classroom. Instead, the autism classroom uses a system based on the TEACCH method. While we love the ABA work we have done at home, and we know that our son has made great progress because of ABA, he does seem to have developed some issues of prompt dependence as a result. After meeting with the teacher and staff, we are excited about the methods used in this classroom, since they will work on helping him learn more self-initiative and independence.

She thought he was just missing rest time. When I pointed this out, she talked to the teacher and we came up with a different solution, which I hope works. I don\'t want him missing academics and his teacher totally agreed. My goal is to keep him in the mainstream classroom for as long as he can handle. I want the resource room to be a safe place he can go if he needs a short break, but I want him to graduate with a diploma if possible! </P> <P>I know I\'m sounding anal - especially since ds is in kindergarten. But, I don\'t want to start out with him being pulled out more than necessary. The ASD teacher agreed and is in full support of him staying in the classroom for almost all of the day. He needs a couple of short breaks and needs to finish his lunch during the class\' rest time - that is it for now. We will adjust as academics get harder and the pressures increase.

'I would request an IEE. What other tests were administered? Any tests for Autism or aspergers? What did the behavior rating scales look like?'
'Schools are not just responsible for academic progress but also for behavioral and FUNCTIONAL progress. If your child has organizational skills issues or social skills issues, he needs an IEP for that. Get the school to give him academic testing EVERY year. If he is not behind now, he will be by 4th grade (when kids are asked to work completely independently) if he doesn\'t get help NOW. Go back to that Advocate and get further advice. Or get a better Advocate.'

During school, they have informed us that his awareness of peers is sufficient for him to learn his ABC\'s (or whatever), which is their main responsibilty.

'<P>Gilda - </P> <P>You might want to make your situation a topic of its own, so it gets the attention it deserves.</P> <P>Micki -</P> <P>My answer below is a little rambling, sorry, but here are my thoughts about structure.</P> <P>I recently had a meeting with the school, and the new vice principal seemed shocked that my oldest son didn\'t have a visual schedule. She wanted to see that happen, and I wasn\'t exactly going to say stop, since the meeting was about the school planning and preparing for his day better. Too much time was being wasted on cozy activities or just plain drawing because there was no sub for his assistant/spec. ed teacher and no plan for him independently using the computer. In order to have a daily plan for HIM to see, they have to do the planning work for THEMSELVES.</P> <P>Anyhow, the first attempt at a visual schedule in 1st or 2nd grade was a failure. It just overwhelmed him to think too far ahead. We\'ll see how it goes now, but for him, it seems like routines work best. He says he hates special days because of the kids shouting hurrah (!) but then again he enjoyed the Christmas assembly more than getting candy at school that day. I see he can tolerate a greater sensory load than he used to, and I think that affects his need for structure and predictability. He can approach these situations with more confidence than fear.</P> <P>He\'s pretty flexible in terms of working with different people (like subs). But doing different kinds of worksheets is tougher. He gets easily overwhelmed by new worksheet tasks, especially if they have a mix of demands. So one kind of structure that\'s really important for him is focusing on one learning goal at a time. In math, we focus on math concepts and not his handwriting, for example.</P> <P>Structure that provides built-in cues is also good because it helps him stay on track with a task. I can\'t really think of any examples right now, but gtto\'s how to boil water video came to mind. And tape on the rug to mark where the child sits (and stays seated) in circle time, things like that. </P> <P>We don\'t have a lot of structure at home, and he does absolutely fine with that.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Norway Mom (mother of 2 sons who were born in 1998 and 2001.

'<P>If this is the annual review meeting, it will start with Present Levels of Performance. What infomation do you already have about his behavior? Is that enough to gauge his current level of behavior? If not, a FBA may be necessary to understand fully his present level of performance. The purpose of an FBA, as you may already know, is to find the FUNCTION of the behavior. The function is vital to know in order to come up with an appropriate behavior plan. When you get the FBA - before or after the meeting - depends on what you want to do with the info. I wouldn\'t postpone the meeting to do the FBA. I\'d have the meeting and table it if it becomes clear that the FBA information is vital in order to write the IEP for next year. You can always agree to whatever CAN be decided and then meet again once the FBA and resulting BIP are prepared. If knowing the function of the behavior is central to deciding placement for next year, then it might be important to get that done first.</P>'

'<P>Karbie - I was the president of our school district\'s SPec. Ed. PTO for 6 years. We have about 2,000 kids in our district who are classified into the spec. ed. system. Any given month, I\'d have 6 to 8 parents attend the meeting. It was VERY discouraging, especially since they were the parents who were the MOST knowlegable and needed the help the least. What I HAVE noticed, though, is the parent of autistic kids seem FAR more involved than the parents of kids with other disabilities. That may be because autism has, until recently, been enough of an unknown disorder that even the teachers were sorely uninformed, so the parents HAD to get involved heavily. It may be possible that the two autistic children you are getting will have similarly involved parents. I hope so.</P> <P>If you know a little about these students (age, functioning level, verbal level, etc.), perhaps some of us can post resources we have that might help you a bit. Of course, this is an excellent site - better than any other autism site I\'ve been on.</P>'

'My daughter found it very hard to jon in floor time. she couldn\'t stand having every one so close to her. She used to sit on a chair just outside the circle with her Aide so she could still see and hear what was happening and join in. Also they had puzzles, and beads(her favourite toys) to play with while they did floortime. My son (also autistic) had his own special mat to sit on - a holden car mat because he loves holdens) and this helped him to stay seated on the floor with everyone else. Be sure to ask the parent what the childs interests are. Liz<div class=\'post_sig\'>- onlinedizzy  2 kids on the Spectrum make life twice as nice</div>'
'We delayed kindergarten for my son who has a June birthday. I enrolled him in our local Head Start program which he went to 4 days a week for almost 4 hours a day and then 3 days a week in ECSE. He also got PT, OT and did gymnastics to help him catch up on many things. We also did a few social skills groups outside of Head Start (which did tons of social skills stuff with all of the kids).<br><br>Our dev ped said that if you are going to hold your child out from kindy - list the reasons why. And then address them all that year that you hold them out. Otherwise, it wasn\'t a good idea. Note that the child doesn\'t need to attain all the goals that you may have listed - but that hopefully they have made progress.<br><br>We have not regretted holding him out. He is in 2nd grade now and his gross motor skills are getting more on par with the kids in his class. We did intensive PT that year we held him and it helped SO much! He learned how to ride a bike without training wheels and use moon shoes and a pogo stick - and all sorts of stuff that kids do. He enjoys playing basketball and football as well.<br><br>Academically, he is doing well. Socially, he has three really good friends and everyone tells me that he is well-liked. When I go to school to volunteer, the kids all talk to him and don\'t look at him strange (well, unless he\'s having an off day and is acting strange). They generally seem happy to see him whenever we see someone from his class.<br><br>Now, this is our experience and every child/family situation is different. You have to decide what is best for you. <br><br>Some districts won\'t let you hold a child out for a year and still provide special ed services. In MN, they let us do that - which we are very thankful for. I\'m not as concerned about the transition years at the end (maybe I\'m naive or just overly optimistic) - but if that is a concern for you, that is definitely something to consider. <br><br>Most people that have held their kids don\'t regret it, but a lot who didn\'t hold their kids do. Research is mixed on the effects. I think not holding can affect a child the first few years - but most research says they eventually catch up. That is with typical kids, so it\'s hard to say for kids with autism.<br><br>My son has always gotten along better with kids who were a year or two younger than him, so this was a good mix for him. He has a lot of social interest, so it helped to have kids around who he was more interested in playing with (younger ones). He got lots more practice with social skills that way, as opposed to being with kids who were mostly older than him (since he has a summer birthday) who might choose to ignore him - which was the case in our old town.<br><br>Again, it is a very personal decision. It\'s hard to know what one is best - but sometimes it helps to hear various perspectives!<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS (9 yo) diagnosed with mild PDD-NOS and DD (6 yo) NT - but definitely a challenge!</div>'

'Calm down. Find out first if you can get him an IEP. Then some of the issues can be addressed through the IEP. Also, since management of his behavior is something that appears to be his greatest school challenge, keeping him at home will not help him learn to manage in a group. Academic progress is the least important predictor of life success. Getting along with others is. Behaving in a way that is welcomed in society is. Think about that.'

'Tzoya, think of it this way, if they have interupted his instruction time, then there is a way of making it up to him.... It could be tutoring him in an area that he is behind on. I myself know of the many battles we have at hand, but they have cheated us and our children of the same amnt. of time as other students and that is something -that is not acceptable! The state is held accountable and they receive funding and we pay our taxes. We have every right to bring it to there attention and now its the\'re choice on doing the right and legal thing. Also, to let you know, it is illegal to have them on the buses for long periods or long commutes. I\'m finding this my way of now probably getting what my son needs in other areas also. I have been fighting for other services and now I\'ve got them at the horns.

'<P>Hi Tammy,</P> <P>My first question is, who administered the ADOS? You probably have the name on paper, but the question really is, is that person a school psychologist, or an autism specialist? A school psychologist is fine, provided that person has experience working with people who have ASD. The results of the ADOS are somewhat subjective, because they depend on the observations of one person (the person who adminstered the test, who can consult with the person who videotaped it). </P> <P>I am sorry, I don\'t know your history, being so new here. But, if the ADOS does not reveal a \"qualifying\" score for ASD, other factors still need to be considered such as observations, and informal tools to examine social understanding, pragmatic language (many of the standardized pragmatic language tests do not reveal the pragmatic language problems in high functioning ASD) and non verbal language.</P> <P>So, a couple of thoughts, if the results of the ADOS feel dramatically wrong to you, perhaps request to have an autism specialist evaluate the videotape and provide an additional set of scores ( if needed), make sure you ask to look at the test protocol (which is the actual score sheet the observer used), or ask that the other measures (2 observations on 2 different days) be looked at more closely.</P> <P>That\'s all I can think of at the moment. </P> <P>Good LUCK! I hope your meeting goes very well.</P>'

'<P>Unless there are out-of-state private schools that are on your \"state approved list\" for special ed placement, the IEP Team does not have the authroity to send your child to a private school. However, you can get them to pay for it anyway, under certain circumstances. An imparital hearing would be required for this. It\'s called a \"Carter case,\" after Shannon Carter, a Florida girl whose parents successfully sued the SD for her tuition at a private placement not approved by the state. Now, it\'s possible for parents to use this precedent to do the same thing. However, the expense, up front, is enormous. And you have to prove 2 things to a hearing officer (or judge if it eventually goes to court). #1 that your child is not being provided FAPE in his current placement (that is unlikely if things are now going well for your son and things remain that way) and #2 that the school YOU have placed him in IS providing FAPE. Yes, you have to place him in the residential school yourself, pay the tuition up front, pay the lawyer up front and wait for reimbursement should the hearing/court case go your way. The cases in my current practicum are almost ALL Carter Cases. It costs parents from $30,000 to over $100,000 UP FRONT. Then, they end up getting reimbursed eventually if they win.</P> <P>Sorry. I don\'t think this was the answer you were hoping for. I\'m really, really glad your son\'s current placement is working. I wouldn\'t worry about the ED designation of the other students. Many probably are Asperger\'s anyway. There\'s a lot of misdiagnosis of that around. Also, many of the ED disorders have symptoms not unlike what our ASD kids go through. As long as your son is placed so that his emotional life is good and he is making progress, that\'s what counts. </P>'
'I have no experience with this, but just opened the post out of curiosity.<br><br>Funny story - my son is completely non-verbal, but his receptive language is 100%. He started a new school in Sept. When we went to \"check in\" on him after week 1, an Aide comes up to us and says \"xmxmnvjfh?\" We smiled, what? She looked puzzled and said \"English is second language in your home, right?\" We said no. She said she assumed since our last name is Russian - that was ds primary language.(yes, it is a crazy free for all at that school - another story). She told us she had been speaking Russian to him all week and he understood her! Of course, we didn\'t believe it. She demonstrated \"sldkdodj\" to ds, and he got up and got crayons. \"ldkdkdod\" he went and packed his bookbag. We were in shock.<br><br>Very, very weird - she did not physically prompt him, but I guess he just got used to her instructions.<br><br>Anyway, maybe ASD kids do have a greater capacity to pick up other languages?<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to Anthony (11-ASD, non-verbal)& Michelle (8-NT)</div>'
'Geez - I almost wish I lived in the US. Where I am (BC, Canada), the <br />school district doesn\'t provide <u><strong>any</strong></u> summer services. <br /> <br />We\'ll be signing Donny up for \"Summer Fun\" again this summer, a joint <br />day camp run by the local YMCA and the local Community Living Services. <br />It\'s for kids ages 5-12, NT, or special needs. The kids are divided into <br />three groups, by age, with two Y counsellors to run programs and care for <br />the NT kids in each group, and CLS staff assisting Y staff, and supporting <br />the kids with special needs. Generally, the CLS staff will have 1-3 <br />children to care for each, in addition to helping out with the group as a <br />whole. <br /> <br />It\'s a lot of fun, they play games, go on trips, etc. The cost is $10/day (8 <br />am - 4 pm), and you pack your kid a lunch. The program is in high <br />demand, with way more special needs kids than CLS staff, so you typically <br />don\'t get many days. For instance, this past summer, Donny got all of 6 <br />days <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"> <br /> <br />If I worked, we\'d be in a whole lot of trouble - the local daycares don\'t <br />have the resources to care for a child with autism. The best you can do is <br />the YMCA day care (which during school year is \"after-school program\", <br />and during summer is \"Summer Fun\"), but even during the school year, <br />even if you provide your own staff for your child, you\'re lucky if they can <br />get your kid in for 2 afternoons per week. People in our town with kids <br />with special needs either don\'t work, or have a trusted friend or relative to <br />care for the child. <br /> <br />Our school district doesn\'t <em>really</em> provide ST/PT/OT, even during the <br />school year. They <em>say</em> they do, but it\'s a total cop out: You can ask <br />that your child receive services, and what will happen is the district\'s <br />therapist will \"assess\" your child, and put forth some very, VERY basic <br />recommendations - like maybe half a dozen minor goals. To get this <br />\"assessment\", there\'s usually about a year to a year and a half wait. The <br />therapist doesn\'t actually DO any therapy with your child - it\'s up to the <br />TAs to implement the therapy. The TAs don\'t have the experience or <br />time. Donny was seen by the district speech therapist in Grade 1, and <br />has been wait-listed to see her again ever since. He\'s seen the OT/PT <br />person twice, once in Kindergarten, and once this year, for observation. <br /> <br />Further, if you provide your OWN PT/OT/ST, like most of the parents in <br />BC do, they cannot go into the school. Further, the school can only follow <br />the plan you\'ve paid for privately, if it is first signed off by the district\'s <br />relevant therapist. <br /> <br />It\'s totally ridiculous. <br /> <br />As a result, Donny\'s only official therapy, even during the school year, is 1 <br />hour per month of combined PT/OT. We did pay for 12 hours of ST this <br />past year, to get assessments and a plan put together. We do everything <br />else ourselves. <br /> <br />Right now, I\'m trying to hire a student to do 10 hours of ABA per week, <br />under my direction, and can\'t even find anyone. To use one of the local <br />ABA companies, I\'d be paying WAY more - $175/hr for consultants, who <br />must see him at least 10 hours per month, plus their billing for <br />coordinating the program, and then pay for the therapy itself on top of <br />that. <br /> <br />Ugh - now I\'m going to go and feel sorry for myself <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley7.gif\" border=\"0\"> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Donny 13 - classic autism, bipolar</div>'

'<P>I have requested to meet with the school pyschologist prior to the testing which will start next week.</P> <P>Here is a little background.. my son is 8yr and dx with autism. Last time he was tested was in March 2006. Most of his testing came back well below average aside from reading which is scored WAY above average. Overall is IQ came back as a 69 which but him within range for MR. Needless to say this was very shocking to us and upsetting.

I feel this is a REALLY sensitive area for me.<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"></P> <P>- If you notice he is having a \"off\" day and extremely not paying attention will you continue testing him or reschedule?</P> <P> </P> <P>I think that sums it up.

'<P>hi all, I only joined the forum today. I am a special education and have been working with children with autism for over 10 years now. I noticed on the forum there are lots of questions etc I may be able to help out with, so thought I would join. I also see a lot of my past students at home and do some one on one tutoring, offer support and advice regarding a range of issues, in particular behaviour support and set up intervention programs. I also do some consultancy to schools and kindys as an independent advocate. At this stage I am doing this a \'favours\' outside of my fulltime teaching role. however, I am hoping to grow my little passion for this area into a mobile service and thought I would just put it out there to gain some idea of people\'s insteres in something like this service. </P> <P>sarah </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- sarahweb</div>'
'<P>Hi everyone!</P> <P>My DS is nearly 4, and we don\'t have an official DX yet. The pediatrician felt he was pdd-nos, and referred us to a developmental behavioral pediatrician. We are currently on the waiting list to be seen. I didn\'t want to wait months to get him some help, so in May i had him evaluated by the school district. The psychologist felt he just had some developmental delays, and would be fine after some therapies. She would eval. him again in the fall and we would officially qualify for services. Over the summer, we did 12 wks of social skills therapy, and began speech therapy this August. I have watched my little boy come out of his shell this summer! He\'s done amazing! 2 weeks ago, he was re-evaluated by the psychologist at the special ed preschool in our school district. She was amazed w/his progress. She said they where really on the fence about whether or not he needs services, but decided to recommend him. Our case conference is 10/2, and at that point everything will become official, and he will have an IEP. My concern is, my DS has some sensory issues. I have a nagging feeling that they will not write OT into his IEP, and he really, really needs it. I can\'t get him OT at the therapy center we attend w/o a DX, and it could be a few more months before we get one/if we get one. </P> <P>Can anyone tell me what my options are w/the school system IF they don\'t write OT into his IEP? I am willing to fight them tooth and nail for it, if I have to.</P> <P>I\'m not sure we exactly belong on an autism forum, but I didn\'t know where else to go for advice on this sort of an issue.</P> <P>tia.</P>'
'Yea, I can call an IEP meeting when I want, was just hoping they wouldnt make it so hard. I put it in writing at his last school, so I\'m not above doing that. And with him being in the back, his teacher couldnt really say why he was, I\'m guessing she didnt take his learning issues into consideration when making the seating chart, which is why I want a meeting so they truly understand him. This particular school has gotten alot better over the years, but when my husband went there, the kids with learning issues tended to be pushed through etc. Well that sooo will not happen with my child, and when I seen his seat in the back, thats how I felt. Little do they know, they cannot pull a quick one with me lol..Thx for the input though, good to hear sometimes I\'m not being crazy! :)<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Kimberly    Son Kameron 9 PDD-NOS, Mixed receptive/expressive language disorder  Kaitlyn 5 NT</div>'

'<P>Jean </P> <P>From what I am reading in my statesboard of education Special education rules is that either you or the school can ask for a due process hearing.

'<P><FONT size=3>Hi everyone. I have a 6yr old son Adam. He has Asperger. We just found out about 7 mo ago. His kindergarten teacher was wonderful. She understood and took some training for autism, went through the whole process with us. Adam is now in first grade and has a new teacher. I don\'t think she has had any training in autism. I recieved a note last friday and was asked how to stop him from stimming. He sings, clicks and hums a lot. He has been injured 3 times so far this year from other students, the teacher says she can\'t do anything about it because she hasn\'t seen it happen. Adam won\'t tell because he was told to worry about himself and not what others are doing, we all know how they love rules. I also found out yesterday that his teacher walked up and gave him an \"angry look\", but never said anything. I asked Adam what he was doing at the time and he of course didn\'t know. I also found out that he has some new students in his class and one has threatened to beat him up and another has started calling him names. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=3>I would go to the old teacher for her advice on the new, but she has left to open a new school.

'I recently pulled my 5yo dd out of her mainstream K class and put her in self contained. We tried letting her get used to the mainstream during the summer pre-k program (lots of problems) and even after school started it was just too much for her even with supports, sensory area, little walks to calm her,everything we could think of. She was just too stimulated all of the time, her aide was well meaning but untrained so basically useless. Meltdowns constantly and too many other kids to deal with so she was just allowed to go on the computer all day. Now she\'s very happy to be in a class where they \"get her\". I just wish I had done it from the beginning. My dd is very advanced academically but if they can\'t ever settle down to do their work what\'s the point? For us mainstreaming was a huge waste of time.'

'<P>It\'s hard to give a wholey constructive opinion not knowing your daughter and her needs, nor knowing the school system. My basic philosophy is to support inclusion as much as possible. It is in this setting where she will receive instruction at a pace aligned with children her same age, and she will also have social models her own age. If inclusion can\'t meet all needs (with accommodations/modifications), then supplement with special education addressing the specific instructional needs. If needs are very intensive, then replace with specialized instruction. Based on your description and my philosophy, I would consider placing your daughter in a regular education class with supplementary, targeted special education instruction. </P>'
'<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=1>Hi everyone- My name is Julie and I\'m brand new here. I\'ve spent the last day or so reading through many posts and think you ladies (and guys) are very insightful. I apologize in advance because I know this is going to be a rather lengthy post. I really hope a few of you at least will take the time to read it and respond... I\'m feeling pretty alone in my struggle at the moment if the truth be told.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=1>My son is eight, 3rd grade, dx with PDD-NOS, ADHD and an Anxiety Disorder when he was five. He is in a Life Skills Class (only option other than general ed. class). Cognitively he is fairly high functioning; socially/behaviorally he is similar to what you would expect of a NT four year old.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>Having him in the Life Skills Class has always proven to be a bit of a struggle when it comes to getting him academic work that is at his level. He reads at grade level and is probably at about a beginning 2nd grade level for math and writing. Most of the other kids in the class don\'t function that close to their grade level, so most activities are geared to their abilities more than his. However, I\'ve always felt that for the time being, this was a more appropriate placement than a general ed. class would be for him in part because of his social/behavior issues.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>We started the process of reviewing his IEP on Tuesday and I think I really rocked the boat. The subject of his reading level came up and the teacher said that they have no curriculum at his level in the room. So, I asked why he couldn\'t get whatever the general ed. 3rd graders are reading and do that. The 3rd grade teacher he is assigned to said she would be willing to provide, the Life Skills teacher didn\'t seem too pleased with the idea. We weren\'t able to work through the entire IEP in the meeting, so we have another one scheduled.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>The school has asked to reevaluate him and unofficially I have been told that if he does well enough on the evaluations they intend to force him to go to his neighborhood school (there was never any discussion of a major change of placement at the meeting). The school he is in now was our neighborhood school until we moved in May. The neighborhood school has NO Life Skills, NO Resource Room. They would put him in a general ed. class for the full day with an aide for part of the day. They say that behavior and social skills deficits are not a reason to keep him in Life Skills if he is academically at grade level. They appear to be totally ignoring his Anxiety Disorder and the issues associated with it. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>I just can\'t wrap my brain around a full day in general ed being an appropriate placement. Just for starters, large groups of children really agitate him to the point he can\'t function and yes he gets what is being taught in a specialized setting, but I don\'t believe he would really get it in a general setting. Also, his attention span is so short; last year one of his goals was to be able to sit for a 20 minute math lesson/activity period, by the end of the year he had worked up to ten minutes.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>I have even greater fears on the social perspective. It took him 2 1/2 years in that class to really began interacting with the kids. Now for the first time, he ackowledges a couple of them as friends (his only friends). Plus, he is having issues with self esteem right now, thinking he is a loser, calling himself a jerk, etc. Add to that the fact that in the last few months we have moved and his dad left for an extended military deployment and I\'m afraid that one more major change would be just too much for him. He is still somewhat traumatized over moving and having serious attachment issues since his dad left. I always thought I would be shouting from the rooftops with excitement the day they told me they believed he was ready for a general ed class; but sadly I feel that this is not the proper time and they are just trying to get me out of their hair. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>I would be supportive of a plan that had him remaining in that school, spending part of the day in his current Life Skills class and part of the day in the general ed. class. Then, possibly considering the move to the new school perhaps next year.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>I\'m reading everything I can get my hands on, but it seems that most of the info is about how to get children into inclusive classrooms... not much on keeping them in a Life Skills or self contained class. I really am kind of at a loss as to where to go from here or how to effectively fight them on it. I am looking for an advocate in the area.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1>I really appreciate you taking the time to read my ramblings... sorry it went on for so long.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=1></FONT> </P> <P><FONT size=1>Julie</FONT></P> <P> </P>'
'<P>I was so glad to find this site. I often feel totally alone out here, educating children with significant disabilities in a small town. When I came here, they were 20 years behind in Special Education. Now, 18 years later, we\'re maybe 10 years behind but we\'ve started to backwards in the last few years. Anyway, the nagging questions I have about BIPs are:</P> <P>1. What do you do when the behavior communicates \" I don\'t want anything to do with anything you want me to do!\"?</P> <P>2. What do you do when you can\'t find any powerful reinforcers that you have control over?</P> <P>I would like to know more about relaxation routines but the student I\'m most concerned about doesn\'t really exhibit his behaviors under stress. I just can\'t get through to him. He doesn\'t care about anything in our world. I struggle to find educational goals that will mean something to him. I also have a concern about stims. For years, I\'ve just felt stims served a purpose and the kids would abandon them once I taught them something else to do but every once in awhile I run across a kid whose stim is so pervasive you can\'t get through to them or their stim is so socially unacceptable that I need to reduce it before I have time to teach something else.

She knows about 40 words from the 100 word list they say a first grader should know and she\'s in the second grade.</P> <P>I would like to know if there is <strong>one</strong> program anyone would recommend that would help us out. Unfortunately I\'m no rocket scientist and I need lesson plans laid out for me. So, it could be a computer program or a book but I need something to get this girl going that\'s interesting. She does love to look at photos and I\'m busy doing some flash cards with words that feature her and family members, pets, local businesses. etc. I did see a book online that had sample lesson plans...<strong>The Reading Lesson: Teach your child to read in 20 easy lessons</strong></P> <P>Has anyone tried that one?</P> <P>I do modify the school\'s work....let her type spelling words, I type answers to things she circles them...etc. Just looking for something inspirational here in the reading dept. if anyone can help.</P> <P>Thanks,</P> <P>Cara</P>'

'<P>It\'s only the potty training thing everyhting else is going pretty well. I had a meeting and was about to have another with the school but they got an aide but it\'s for every child in the class. This is a typical school my daughter is almost 5 yrs and it is Pre-k. Since they got an aide i sent in a chart to tell me when my daughter is dry/wet and how frequently my daughter is taken to the potty. </P> <P>So the family worker comes out telling me shes confused and so is the aide that the aide is for the other kids too. So who the heck is gonna take my daughter more frequently?!!! Also the school has another aide in the class as well to help out what the heck is their problem. So i had a meeting to get an aide for other kids that mostly all are potty trained and they can\'t take my daughter more to the potty or track it? I\'m angry because we were gonna have a meeting and i should be making the potty goals more specific. If i want to ask for a new \"Norap\" (hopefully i spelled that right) do we need to have a meeting? The stupid teacher that takes care of the IEP is nowhere and she isnt taking my calls now everyone claims she isnt there. Why should i be working hard at home to get my daughter trained but yet at school they wait 2 hrs and then take her with the rest of the class, shes having leaks and all in her pull-up. The PCA was taken out of her IEP now i have to fight to get it back in and the school wont budge trying to tell me i will need to fight for it again once she goes to kindergarten.

'I think it is very hard for teachers to give our kids everything they need. They have over 20 other students in the class and ours is not the only one with special needs. All children have needs and they need to spend their time proportionally for all kids. This is why mainstreaming can be so difficult. <br>I know that one year I had a child who was mentally ill and he consumed so much energy and time that I worried constantly that the other kids did not learn or get as much attention as they deserved. <br>I think that as a teacher and a mom of a child with autism it is important to make sure that the teacher has enough of support and education. Special educators could help by covering the classroom so the classroom teacher could spend quality time with student with special needs.<br> In my experience it is the aide who ends up teaching our kids and this takes away from classroom teachers control and relationships. Most teachers are doing a great job. We just need to be aware of the limitations.<br>Cecelia<br>Mom to Emily,9, and Nick, 7<br>'

'<P>A one on one is hard to come by especially in a budget crisis. Like others said, I\'d stress flight risk and safety risk. I am not sure what your district has to offer but this might lead the district to come back and say that if your dd is such high risk that she will need to be in a self-contained class. My ds is in mainstream with a 1:1. He is not really a flight or safety risk though he on occasion has had his moments. He has great language, is socially engaged, high IQ-just really \'different\' from mainstream peers. This year the district had to slash their budget and even though my son has been doing well they recommend a more restrictive program. I know it is mostly about saving 1:1 funds but of course they can\'t say that because an IEP is supposed to be about needs not funding. Still I don\'t even blame them: the extra for a full time EA has to be about 20,000 and of course they rather have him take the empty spot in a more restrictive setting.</P> <P>As far as what do you want in an EA - my school did not let me have input and as far as I heard their only criteria was someone who has a history of rarely calling in sick because EAs don\'t get substitutes. If they let you have input I\'d look for someone with a very developed theory of mind, meaning someone who is not rigid herself but can understand where your dd is coming from.

'<FONT size=1>I\'m in Wisconsin and lived in Illinois, but, if this is a mainstream classrom, 25 kids is standard. I put my son in Special Ed-he is in a small class with an aide, and gets so much attention. His academic and life skills have really taken off. They sort of stagnated in mainstream school. Special Ed doesn\'t mean \"low IQ.\" The kids can work up to their ability, even if they\'re gifted, but they don\'t have 24 other kids distracting them, and they get help when they need it, both behaviorally and academically. If you\'re talking about a Special Ed class that\'s HUGE. I\'d still give it a shot. They may hire more aides or you can fight to get your child her own aide (we got a 2-1 aide for Lucas, yes, it was a battle). Although my son spends at least 40% of his time in a \"typical\" envoronment, I have read and my own experiences lead me to believe that ASD kids don\'t mimic \"typical\" behavior, no matter how much they are exposed to it. I think my son became socially acceptable by all the learning about it (role playing, social skills class, text book social skills teaching) in special ed. I think, and its\' just my opinion, that there is a big misconception that ASD kids \"pick up\" how to interact socially when they watch \"typical\" kids. I don\'t think they pay all that much attention to them and can be harmed being in mainstream all day because they aren\'t accepted by the other kids, and my son used to be very sad that he never got invited to birthdays or that nobody wanted him on their team. In SE he has friends and even made some \"typical\" friends-not a lot, but a few. I wouldn\'t homeschool an ASD kid. There are no serivices at home and, imho, it just isolates the kids more than ever. For our kids, I believe getting out in the world is just as much, and even more important, than their academics. I wish you luck...I truly think you will see an overall improvement in how your child relates to large enviroments and stimuli as she gets older. Our precious ASD kids tend tend to improve with the right intervetions. Unlike some disorders that get worse, ASD kids improve! And that\'s great! <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"></FONT> <span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by pammar on August 11 2006 at 4:48am</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Pam from WI</div>'

'<P><FONT size=2>I agree with Tzoya that having a para for the reason of staying on task is not the answer to that problem. This teacher and class aid need to step up and keep him on task. IT\'S THEIR JOB!!!! And it makes me so mad to hear that she is sending work home saying he was off task for as much as 10-20 mins without being redirceted. I have a feeling that if her administrators knew this, she\'d be in hot water. Especially with the special ed administration, as she is about to cost the system more money and your child his access to a free and APPROPRITATE education. When really all she has to do is keep your son on task and then the work can get done. Now that she has told you he\'s off task all that time, your next question to her should be how are you redirecting him. If this much work is coming home undone, she better have some dang good documentation somewhere of what was tried before she sent it home. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>You need to meet with the IEP team and ask that question. You need to see what he can do when he is redirected by the adults in his class rather than a one on one aide. All of the children at my school right now with one on one paras DON\'T need them and it makes me so upset to see how dependent they are on that adult. They can\'t do ANYTHING without the lead of someone else. Not even go to the bathroom or p.e. alone. Mainly I think that is because the para feels responsible and if something were to happen when she wasn\'t around, she feels she\'d be held liable. This comes from untrained and nontrained aides, which is common. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>I just can\'t stress enough that your son needs to be given best practices of redirecting and positive behavioral supports for being off task before his independent, appropriate access to the general education system is taken away. I know you say he is young and might be missing critical skills because he is off task, but this is also the prime time for him to learn to become dependent on an aid. If i were you, I\'d be holding the teacher\'s feet to the fire on this one. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>Call an IEP meeting and address your concerns about so much work coming home and him staying off task for so long. Have accommodations put into the IEP so that he is able to only do some of the work. If he can do the first half it correctly, he isn\'t missing anything by not doing the second half. It\'s not the quantity of work we are looking for, it\'s the quality. Teacher\'s just need to know if a child can do a skill or not, not know that they can do it 50 times. Ask specifically to know what the teacher and class aid are doing during all that time that he is off task. The fact that \"you wish\" you could make them accommodate is not acceptable, nor is it acceptable for the teacher to say she has 20 other students and can\'t take that much time to redirect your son. IT\'S HER JOB!!!! And only you can fight her to make her do it. I promise you the administrators would rather make her do her job instead of spend money to get an aid. And your son is going to benefit so much more from her doing her job.</FONT></P>'
'<P>My son is getting intensive intervention in reading during school which he gets pulled out for. Hes getting 2 hours and 45 minutes a day of reading pullouts. He has been sounding out sounds all day long (literally all day long!) so hes made huge progress there because he didnt know his sounds at all. </P> <P>As far as identifying his alphabets when you point and ask him which is which he can only name a few which are H, S, O and X. They are basicaly the same alphabets he knew a year ago. His teacher mentioned to me last week that hes really struggling with identifying them but hes doing great on learning his sounds. </P> <P>I think its strange because when hes writing his name hel write H then pause and not know what to write next once in awhile and il have to tell him \"A comes next\" and he write it! </P> <P>Anyway is there any type of learning approach taht we can use for him that will help him? Someone mentioned aba based learning but im not exactly sure how they teach that way. And his problem seems to be memory based i think.</P> <P>The other day he came home from school melting down and saying that he cant remember his \'memories\'and went on to cry that he wanted everything to be the same (he does this fromtime to time) like furniture back the way it was, walls the color they were. He also was crying that his memories he cant remember his memories over again. I asked him if he had trouble in school and he said yes. His teacher told me a couple weeks ago that hes having trouble remember what he supposed to do if she explains whatthe kids need to do hel just sit there but the other day he came up to her and said \"I just dont know what to do!\" I feel bad for him :( </P> <P>Anyway, any advice would be appreciated!

'Thank for the replies. I went again today for two hours and they had <br />things a bit more organized. I am not sure he is learning much but I do <br />like his teacher and he is fine with being there. But I have to say just <br />sitting in and observing has been giving me a lot of food for thought <br />about what kind of program I want for my kid. I saw another kid (about 6 <br />and scrawny) who had a hard time adjusting to the different school & <br />teacher and got very restless and agitated and hitting (not hard-more <br />flailing about) and they kept bringing him into a padded quiet room. I <br />have to say that it seems to me that systems tend to err on the side of <br />caution and if there are restrictive measures in place they will use them. I <br />know that a padded quiet room is not in-itself an evil place and does <br />provide security for the kid but at the same time I think there could be <br />better ways in which the kid could calm himself and for the staff learn <br />how to read him. A quiet room is just too convenient and provides little <br />opportunity for a teachable moment. (And I speak from the experience of <br />having worked on psychiatric units with quiet rooms.) <br />Maybe just seing my kid in a place like that still gets to me. It was like the <br />first time I heard myself saying \"my son is seeing his psychiatrist this <br />morning\" and it echoed in my head. It just sounded soo wrong - not what <br />childhood should be like.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- micki, mom to three wonderful and wild kids.  ds 10 asperger & anxiety  twin dds 6 quirky but NT this far</div>'
'<P>momdadtojake - Very important part to mention! That definitely changes my thoughts, then. I was mentioning that there are other things out there that help a child, and ABA doesn\'t necessarily need to be written into a goal or skill. However, if you are doing a full ABA program and it has been successful with your child, and he would potentially lose these services after having received them for six months, it would probably be important to get ABA actually written into the IEP. This would be your grounds for sending him to an out of district placement. What state are you in? I can check into whether the district in your state is allowed to tell you \"no specific methodology\" or not. </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>-   \"We should not strive to change the child with autism to fit the learning environment; rather we need to change the learning environment to fit the learning characteristics of the child.\" (TEACCH)</div>'

'The truth is the Govt. starting this year is making disability eligibilty scores higher so less kids can qualify for services and to take alternative state Tests. Another words less kids will qualify for Se is the goal. This was on the radio where I live in Tx. Isn\'t that loosing the child rights under disability law. Govt. wants less in Se.

'<P>I\'m not at home right now, so I don\'t know if a pm would be sent to another computer, but I haven\'t gotten one here. I\'ll check tomorrow when I get home.</P> <P>Believe me, the home school has LOTS of power. The \"providers,\" be they individual service providers, private schools approved of by the home district, county run schools or schools within other districts, ALL want to get paid. And they get paid HANDSOMELY by the home school, so the home school has plenty of leverage. Every situation is different in terms of the agreements, of course, but I believe out-of-district schools sign contracts that agree to implement the IEP to the letter. If the school is a private school paid for by the PARENTS, though, that is very different. However, if it\'s an approved private school paid for by the District and it\'s the placement of record on the child\'s IEP, the District has PLENTY of power, since it holds the purse strings. It\'s imperative that there be ONE entity with authority and power. Otherwise, no school could ever be pinned down. So, the home district is the one with the responsibility and the authority. If the parents have trouble in an out-of-district placement, they need to go to the administrators in the HOME DISTRICT and tell them, preferably in writing, that the child\'s IEP is not being implemented. The home district is paying PLENTY for the IEP to be implemented and they will be the ones in trouble if it ISN\'T implemented, so they have a vested interest in seeing that the other district does the job it has agreed to do. Of course, the out-of-district school can say, at the outset, that they are limited in what they can provide, but then the home school needs to find another way to provide that service. If there isn\'t ONE entity that is ultimately responsible, then no one will ever be responsible. </P>'

'<P>tzoya, </P> <P>to answer your question... NO </P> <P>The way this school appoints paras is to observe the child the first two weeks of the school year. And than the pricipal will decide where the paras will be placed. So the IEP states this. ( somthing like .. suppport staff will be in place at the start of the year, and evaluate the need). So I know he will have a para for SOME of the time, but I think a full time para would be the best. </P> <P>So we have an IEP meeting after school starts. </P> <P>I will check out the links horanimals posted. </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to Matthew almost 9 yrs old (AS) and Jason 5 yr old (NT)</div>'

'<P>OMG - NEVER give a school district access to your child\'s medical records or ANY records outside of school! Rescind that permission asap. Then ASK, specifically, what records they want to see and decide for yourself if you want to give those records, in writing to them. ALL records should come through YOU. </P> <P>Neuropsychological evaluations are not something permanent. They are about where the child is functioning at the moment. YEs, they can say they believe the child is autistic and often DO say that. This is an educational diagnosis from an educator (albeit a VERY INFORMED educator) and may or may not stand up in a hearing, should it come to that. Many place DO accept the opinion of a NEuropsychologist, though, however the other testing he does (speech, reading, math, IQ) is only valid for a short while - like 3 years. If your District is looking for a MEDICAL diagnosis, go to an IEP meeting and ask them to pay for an IEE of your child at the doctor of your choice. Of course, since they will pay for it, they will have access to it. ALternatively, you can find the \"go-to\" doctor in your area who gives medical diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorders and get a dx through your insurance or on your own dime that WOULD stand up in a hearing because it came from a doctor.</P> <P>The school district can certainly perform the ADOS, with your permission, though. If it comes back saying that your child is NOT on the spectrum, ask for an IEE and get them to pay for one from a practitioner of your choice.</P>'
'It is true we all have a lot of rights. And we all should be AWARE of our and our child\'s rights. However, sometimes it\'s important to consider sending a child to a different school, even a far away school. Sometimes it\'s more important to keep our children in their neighborhoods. It all depends on the school, the family and, most importantly, the individual child\'s NEEDS. These children are OUR children, not the school\'s. They can have every IEP meeting they want, but they CAN\'T make a parent do what that parent thinks is WRONG for that child. At least no without a big legal wrangle. When we go to IEP meetings, there are people in that room who are experts in psychology, in education, in OT, in PT, in speech, in autism. But not a one of them is as much an expert in YOUR CHILD as YOU are. Of course it\'s vital that we seek their advice and make informed decisions on their advice, but in the end, the IEP Committee does not fully determine what will happen to your child - YOU do.'
'<P>Mamabear,</P> <P> The actual teacher your dd gets is really important. Did you check on their personality and teaching styles? I would inquire and make a request for who I think would be a better fit. My older kids had this teacher in kindy who had a personality that pulled kids out, involved them and was involved with each and every child in her class the best way. My kids had different personalities and different levels of maturity, she just had it and was the best, my more quiet and shy child was as involved with her and the classmates as well as my more outgoing child. So maybe you will be fortunate to find such a gem, if you find her she will let you know if more needs to be done by involving an aide. </P> <P> I know of one situation where the child had adhd and the mother was the class mom for 2 years.

She began to tell me that one of the older boys in the AI room is becoming more aggressive and is hitting the other kids in class. Alex was hit yesterday. She wanted to let me know what was happening and subtly inferred that I should call the school principal and/or special ed dept to complain.

'Well, I talked to an Advocate from the state of Ohio and learned some new info that made me even more angry with my school district. My son is in 2ng grade now, and in kind. and 1st we had IAT meetings every 3 months, and I thought this was normal for one. Every meeting however we had the same results, same problems and keep doing the same thing basically. I FInally got an MFE done from the school psychol. and academically they said his scores didnt qualify him for special services. Although they new he needed extra help with all of his work because he doesnt \"get it\" on his own. I just got his DX of PDD-NOS, Mixed receptive/expressive language, borderline intell. functioning this month, and they dont care to take it into account!! They basically just repeat things to him to help and that is the extent of it. They took it upon themselves to put him into a smaller reading and math class-title, but say he doesnt qualify for title! They wont put it in writing that he NEEDS title, or give me an IEP, when he cannot do work on his own typically. Plus he gets a little anxiety and every now and then doesnt want to go to school etc. <br />Well to sum up the advocate told me they obviously know he needs extra help because we had the IAT meetings for 2 years, but did not do anything major to help him. And since THEY put him into smaller groups, even though they wont say he Needs title classes, they really know he does. And they havent even taken into account on his school eval my New Dx so that changes things also...Just soo frustrated that the school gave me the run around going on 3 years now and they should have been doing more, adn i thought that, but finally made the proper choice in calling and ADvocate to help me better understand my sons rights..Well tomorrow I am drawing up the papers to serve to the school from the advocate, and will make them do something finally with her on my side!! They will not let my son fall through the cracks because they do not want the extra paperwork and time he needs! He is already going to be 8 in Feb. and its been a long fight, poor kid should have had more help before, but I couldnt even get his Dx from someone until this month!

'Thank you for your replies. Her IEP states 2x week individual therapy and 1x a week group. Her articulation is at less than 1% ranking amongst her peers. She has the articulation patterns of an 18 month old according to the tests, so her speech needs are pretty critical. She is not getting what she needs in group because group is three other children and listening to them talk they speak so much better than her. Maybe its some peer modeling situation but I doubt it knowing how my school district works. Its just a way to \"give\" children their services in a very cost effective manner. <br><br>I\'m upset about the day change because they initially asked me which days would work for Annabelle and I told them Mon, Tues, and Thurs and I told them why. That is what we agreed on and then they changed it in December without consulting me and now they are telling me that there is no other time to fit her in so they will have to drop that day a week. I look at the goals on her IEP and I don\'t think she has met even the goals she had for last year, so its not like she can afford to drop that day of the week. Her private therapy is important because it makes up the additional hour Annabelle needs that the school couldn\'t accomodate originally (last year) and they focus more on day to day speech. <br><br>The developmental ped we saw in Sept said that the district did the bare minimum testing regarding Annabelle\'s speech. He and the evaluators at the second eval we had done picked up on Annabelle\'s expressive language disorder and the district did not. So, all the school district does is focus on articulation and not expressive language, our private therapist does both.<br><br>I am just so tired of fighting these people. I am not an assertive person by nature and this really puts me outside of my comfort zone. Just attending an IEP meeting is way outside my comfort zone, fighting the district is well out of it. I know that I need to do what is best for my daughter but I am not sure if fighting is the best. I really already feel that my daughter isn\'t really getting any services at all from the school but they are just having her there to assuage me. It seems like both of the school pathologist don\'t like my daughter or me. <img src=\"smileys/smiley18.gif\" border=\"0\"> It almost feels like the more I fight the less she really will get in the end.

'<P>This is some really bad stuff. The special ed administrators in your district should know what is and what is not acceptable. It is their responsibility to take the safety factors into account. I am going to reiterate my opinion that in many cases the administrators (the ones who actually have the power to do something) do not realize the crap that students with disabilities are subjected to by others in the district (i.e. transportation folks and principals). Usually they are the last ones to know the particulars regarding any transgression. By the time they find out parents are usually irate and the administrator know has to go back and try to fix the mess that was created by others. This creates a whole other dilemma as the special ed administrator then has to figure out how to fix the situation without stepping on toes. At the same time they have to educate the transportation person who was operating from their frame of reference as opposed to the child\'s and parents frame of reference.Many times it is a training issue and these events serve as opportunities to train those who do not have a good grasp of the needs of student\'s with autism. Finally, this is all conveluted by the fact that special ed administrators are still district employees who need to have one foot in the rotten culture of exclusion that still permeates many districts throughout the country. They have to maintain the image of being team players while also fighting the negative vestiges of a system that was never created to work with those students who present differences (we are still part of a system that has shown little propensity to change - bureaucracies are very slow to change and schools represent the last vestiges of the industrial revolution). </P> <P>I work with a great many people who do not believe that all kids can learn. They still do not think that all of our kids belong and do not see the value of educating all students in our system. But I digress, the bottom line is that the special ed administrator also has to play the game if they are going to be able to navigate the system and cash in on relationships later. Furthermore, being part of the district team means outwardly supporting that team even if you know and believe that it is screwed up. The ability to change it from within will not come from fighting the sytem but rather knowing the system and manipulating the sytem for the purpose of changing from within. I think that the average special ed administrator lives this every day. The effect is certainly an inefficient system that does not always take into full account the individual differences of all of our students. Administrators are constantly fighting the \"one size fits all\" approach. Parents often times do not see this battle as it is a carefully kept secret that goes on behind closed doors were nobody can see. Principals hate sped administrators because they challange their authority to run their own little kingdom where they are free to make all of the decisions (regardless of whether or not they are legal). The same holds true of transportation folks. Special ed does not jibe with their goal to move as many kids as possible in the shortest amount of time. In my opinion everything needs to be treated as an opportunity to teach and to train. Transportation issues provide me with the opportunity to sit down with the transportation manager and/or the bus driver and discuss the needs of a particular student with autism. It also might present me with the opportunity to provide them with some insight into the students wants, needs and strengths (something that bus drivers rarely have the time to contemplate). In our office we call it \"preaching the good word.\"</P> <P>The biggest mistake that I think special ed administrators make is when they blindly fallow the districts lead believing that their district could do no wrong. The loyalty sometimes acts like blinders to the actual truth of what is going on. That being said, it is sometimes the sheer amount of students, paper work andadministrative responsibility that can serve to have a similar effect (creates blinders). The other mistake that I sometimes see is the inability of administrators to be frank about things. Especially in larger districts the special ed director has little control regarding the day to day happenings in a classroom. Typically the sped director does not even know the teacher in the classroom. Many times the principal hires the teacher and is the one to evaluate him/her regardless of the fact that principal may have very little training in special ed. This is allot like the transportation issue where the sped administrator is the last one to find out when something goes awry. A good administrator when they hear about a possible issue will go and ask questions, investigate the situation thoroughly and will evaluate whether or not the incident did or did not occur. They should not blindly defend their teacher or their program. They should not sweep the issue under the table. Instead, they should hold the situation up to the light so that they can use it as an opportunity to better their service delivery. Most importantly though, they should be honest when a screw up occurs (and they will occur) and work with the parent to make it right even if it means providing compensatory education and/or other expensive interventions. This is called taking responsibility for your actions (i.e. the districts actions where you as a representative bear some of the responsibility). Integrity is a huge part of a well respected and a well rounded district wide special ed program. Furthermore, when your customers know that you are willing to work with them in an honest fashion and that you want to do the right thing then I believe that they are more willing to provide you with some leeway and will also be more likely to excercise patience as you seek to improve upon things.</P> <P>Ok, I can know get off of my soap box.

'To answer your question, both yes and no. Yes we have been funded in <br />the past, but going forward we will have a rough time of it. We were able <br />to secure funding in the past because we started an ABA program before <br />EI or SD had any time to react. Our ABA provider already had a master <br />contract with our EI and SD to provide services. We were able to prove <br />that our son made tremendous progress with ABA. When we transitioned <br />to the SD at age 3, our son was not ready for a preschool program. (our <br />neuropsyche recommended a typical one with a shadow aide) We <br />declined their offer of a school placement and continued on his IEP goals <br />within his ABA program and ABA playgroup. We still get funding from EI <br />for parent training and self help skills (ABA) we also get funding from the <br />SD (ABA) We declined their speech as it was too short and at inconvenient <br />times. We do private instead. <br /> <br />All that being said. You will need an attorney, a very good eval that will <br />stand up in court. May be some expert testimony. You need to have a <br />plan as to what your child needs to be working on etc that they can not <br />do at school. You need to state that ABA teaches your son how to learn <br />from his enviroment. You need to play the behavior card as well. <br />Remember the SD only has to prove that their offer or program have <br />some benefit (not the best) <br />Our goal is to graduate from all services within the next two years. <br /> <br />Sorry to ramble.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to ds age 17/nt   dd age 14/nt   ds age 6/asd</div>'

'This is an interesting thread and unfortunately, I didn\'t read all the posts.. What is do know is the strain my marriage feels since autism has been a part of our lives, which is just over 1 year.. I am married to a wonderful man who is <br />100% on board with our son, autism, this marriage etc. He is truly amazing and weI couldn\'t survive without him. HIs schedule allows him to be home 5 days of the week and he is the primary caretaker to the boys on weekdays, when I <br />work from home (which is what I am supposed to be doing right now!). I only mention all that because even though we have a good marriage and we both are with our boys all the time and he is such a support in all other ways, WE STILL <br />Struggle all the time. The stress of living this life is immense. We often feel like prisoners in our home because going into the community is hard with our son. We often end up doing things alone, or with just one child and they <br />opportunities we do get to ALL get our are usually to a 1. park, 2. a kids place like Gymboree or Jumpin Jakes etc. We NEVER go out to eat, Never go shopping, Never go Apple Picking, or street fairs, or festivals or theme parks etc.. You <br />get the idea- all the things typical families do, we feel robbed of doing. A lot of our typical friends just don\'t get it, making our friendships strained. So, even under pretty good circumstances, we are both angry and sad a lot and the <br />little irritating things we both do that we used to ignore are just the icing on the cake here.

'<P>I haven\'t read all the responses but I wanted to emphasize two things:</P> <P>1. The IEP<strong> <U>TEAM </U></strong>makes all the decisions about your son\'s placement and education, not one administrator. </P> <P>2. The I in IEP means INDIVIDUAL and the law totally supports that. If your son, individually, needs to be mainstreamed but also needs special transportation, that has to be included in his IEP.</P> <P>All that said, I\'d love to know why you want him mainstreamed in 6th grade and what supports you think he\'ll need to transition into a mainstreamed situation in Middle School. MS is a HUGE transition for ALL kids and is particularly difficult for kids with autism of any kind. That\'s not to say that mainstreaming is a wrong choice, but ANY choice for next year HAS to be thought through carefully by anyone on the IEP TEam (and this includes you). Have you seen the Middle School classes you want him in? Can you think of any way in which he will need support in order to \"make it\" in those classes? What are his current issues? How will they be addressed? Of course, they HAVE to put him in the LEast Restrictive Environment in which he can make educational progress. But \"make educational progress\" is the key part of that. Mainstreaming may or may not be the least restrictive environment for your son. Maybe it is. But you\'ll have to make a CASE that it is and the first step toward doing that is to actually SEE the possible mainstream classes and compare them to the next most restrictive environment. MS is VERY challenging for an ASD child just at the moment when the hormones kick in. Anxiety increases, biologically, so you have to factor that in, too. There will have to be a BIG safety net for your son. Mainstreaming might be great for him but not withoug full cooperation from the school and full support written into his IEP.</P>'

'A teacher cant refuse to take a child on the trip if you signed the paper to permit him to go . If you cant go it make no difference on him attending. Now if y ou as his mother think he cant handle it ,dont send him. he is allowed to stay in the school on another classroom while they come back, This is what they do in my son\'s school. There is one kid who is non verbal from what i can see and has behavior issues and he never goes to trips or isbt allowed and i have see another teacher picks him up and takes him to her class until we come back . If y ou want him to go , thats why they have aides and other tehrapists join th trips, to help these kids and they learn in the trips also.

'<P>It\'s not as easy as claiming your rights. You DO have rights to be sure, however, most savvy schools are not going to roll over all that easily when a parent says, \"no\" to their proposed IEP plan. Other school districts have lawyers already on the payroll so many don\'t even flinch when you mention \"due process.\" I\'m not saying to not exercise your rights to due process, I have, but you need to be prepared to be in it for the long haul, emotionally and financially.</P> <P>I work for a school district and I\'m also the parent of 3 boys that are all on the autism spectrum. I\'ve been on both sides of the fence when it comes to IEP\'s and placement. Usually disagreements revolve around cost or control. Nobody is going to SAY that \"cost\" is an issue (i.e., hiring a paraprofessional) but it is a hidden factor sometimes in LRE. Control is another issue: many school staff do not feel that parents \"know\" what\'s best for their child. I\'m NOT saying this is the case, I\'m just saying that\'s the perception and why they can seem so controlling (i.e. not flexible to your suggestions).</P> <P>I think that what everyone has said so far about getting educated on your rights is critical ! You\'ll have these types of issues as the years roll on so it\'s worth the investment to learn what you don\'t know yet about the IEP process. Another option is to find an advocate who will attend the meeting with you. Google \"IEP advocate\" for your geographical area and see what you come up with. </P> <P>Learn what you need to learn. Start creating a paper trail (send and save emails concerning your concerns) and become a good negotiator because finding ways to work with your school rather than against them will probably serve your interests in the long run. Blatant disregard for you, your child, and/or your rights should always be tactfully addressed! However, most IEP lawyers recommend learning to be a smart negotiator.

'<P>Emma\'smom, I hear that laws in California are tricky all the way around. Where I live, special ed teachers are employed by and are representatives of the \"Special School District\", who then places the teachers in the local districts. The local school districts do not hire their own special ed teachers. So, they have a sort of monopoly on the special education corner, unless I can find employment in a private school. (I\'m crossing my fingers for that.) There are a couple of tuition-based private schools in my area that cater to LD kids exclusively, but due my daughter\'s emotional instability those schools are not an option for her. </P> <P>Going off-topic a little: I was worried that it might be impossible to work as a special ed teacher all day long, while being a mom to a special needs kid, and to still somehow maintain sanity. It seems like you\'re still sane &amp; rational. (Congratulations!) Are IEP meetings tough for you as a teacher facing a student\'s parent? How do you handle that?</P>'

'All these replys have been great and helpful -thanks. <br />We did have the IEP meeting with the new school. They are a pretty small <br />operation (what I like) and kept telling me how it will be hard giving my <br />ds the \'extra\' he needs with the few staff they have, but they also said <br />that the IEP was appropriate and they would make it work. <br />I asked if there was a question of them taking him and they said they will <br />talk with the principal and let me know. I asked if as a public school they <br />can refuse him and they said \"That is a good question\". I think part of <br />the problem is that I am dealing with extreme West Coast flakyness. I also <br />pointed at the IEP specifying that ds needs a person at the beginning of <br />the school year to help him transition and ask how that would look like <br />at their school and again was told -with a smile-that \"That is a good <br />question\" <br />After spending last year being told that my ds could not get the help he <br />needs because he had no IEP I am not planning on spending the next <br />year hearing that the IEP is a puzzle to implement. <br />So my plan is to get back to studying Wrightlaw and call frequent IEP <br />meeting until it is understood that I expect them to follow it. <br />Angelstill, thanks for the advice to request every refusal or promise in <br />writing.

'<P>Hi there, I have been reading on this board for almost one year now and have gotten lots of great information. I just did not feel that i had anything to contribute to the board, so I really haven\'t posted up until now.</P> <P>To give you a quick history.... DS was diagnosed with PDD/NOS at age 3. Went to early childhood 3K, remained at this school and was put into an inclusive classroom with support and pullout in 4k, now is 5.75years old and in inclusive 5K with support and pullout at new elementary school.</P> <P>Ds is very bright and smart. He has been getting intensive inhome therapy supplied by the state now for just over two years, he is eligible for three years if he qualifies each year. He has made such progress that he will not even be using up the entire three years. His psychologist says that he is definately Asperger, high function, what ever the heck that means.</P> <P>He is doing great academically, average and above average in most categories, except pretend play and socialization that is, of course. Reading at a second grade level.</P> <P>We had his IEP meeting on Tuesday and we were told in the last 5 minutes of our alloted 1.25 hour meeting that he would not be receiving special ed any longer and would not get a new IEP. My husband told me that he felt that it was coming and so did Ds\'s therapists and psychologist, who were present. But, I did not see it coming, until the last fiveminutes of course. I was wondering how they were going to get the goals and everything else in with out going over. There were two more IEP\'s following oursthat day, it was an IEP marathon for them.</P> <P>I am just numb right now. I am happy and thankful that he is doing so great academically in school, even his behaviours are wonderful. they say. He is not so wonderful at home, behaviorly, which is okay, he\'s go tot let it out somewhere. But, socially, he just is not like the others. I have been told by the teachers that he is well liked and sought out. That he seeks out the other children, but the few times I have been there, I have not seen a whole lot of this. I M affraid of him being left behind the other kids and having anxiety and depression being alone.</P> <P>He goes M-F, fullday on Monday and Friday, until 2:00 T,W, and R. In the afternoons they have a second recess at the end of the day, where they play inside and can do what ever they want. The school says because he has not been there the entire year for the last recess, he is not in the loop of the other kids like he might have been. We just started the fulldays in January. That was brought up at the iEP, that he still is not soming to school every day fulltime. He says he has kids that he sits by and plays with, but he never says that he wants them to come over to play or anything like that. I know, that is a stretch for our kiddos, but that is what I want him to be able to achieve. Be able to WANT and to ASK another child to come over and play.</P> <P>What my concern is that he now goes to a school which is not his home school, because he had to go where they offered the early childhoood kindergarten. So, next year for first grade, he has to go to his home based school, a new school and a new transition for him. He has not transitioned to new schools well to put it mildly in the past. He has had a terrible time starting in the fall, with help from the special ed teachers and aides. What is going to happen next year?</P> <P> </P> <P>We have been promised accomodations by the new prinicipal, who was also at the IEP such as a friendship group, breaks when he needs them and a few other items, which for the life of me I can\'t remember right now. I was just flabbergasted when I realized what was happening. I did make the meeting run over by 20 minutes, because I thought I will be d++++ed if you will unload this bomb on me and my son and then not answer my questions. We did not even get a chance to even make any statements or comments. I think at the very least they should have allowed time for questions that we may have had.</P> <P>Up until now, I have been VERY happy and satisfied with how the system has taken care of my son, albeit we are only in the beginning stages of this maze. There was an autism \"consultant\" at the meeting. She shot my son down the first IEP three years ago when he was qualifying for services to start with. She said that she did not agree with the autism diagnosis. And on Tuesday she said it again. She did admit that he benefited from services that he has gotten but disputed that the psychologist(s) that diagnosed him used the most lienient form of tests to get him qualified for services, kind of like, \"be glad for what you have gotten\". She is not very nice, in my eyes anyhow.</P> <P>So, I hope the new school will stand by their offer of accomodations for DS in fall.</P> <P> </P> <P>Does anyone have any other suggestions on what we should be doing or preparing in the mean time?</P> <P> </P> <P>Also, would you have any suggestions for books for advocacy and knowing the laws of the school systems?</P> <P> </P> <P>This has been a long ramble, and if you are still with me, God bless you.</P> <P> </P> <P>Take care and have a great day</P> <P> </P> <P>Robbin</P>'
'<P>I would absolutely go and observe and see if there are things that can help him at the ISD preschool. You don\'t step in, and honestly I would tell him before he goes that you are there to watch, not to interact. If there are sensory things they could do for him, I would absolutely ask for those. Does he get outside OT for sensory integration?? Schools often won\'t do this, and won\'t take it into consideration either. </P> <P>It is nice to hear that I am not the only one with a child that acts out after being fairly typical/normal at a school day.

'<P>Since Matthew has AS, sensory issues are a part of who he is and it should be easy for you to find documentation in his most recent evaluation of his sensory needs. If you do, highlight it, send a copy to the case manager, and simply ask if a sensory diet can be added as an accommodation in his IEP. The worst they can say is no, and then you ask for an IEP meeting.</P> <P>If the eval report does not document sensory needs, you can ask for staff to do informal observations, or you can request an assessment that includes observations and sensory profile. </P> <P>The important part is, once you get this written into his IEP, it does not matter if they agree or not, they just have to do it.</P> <P>I hear you about schools not always being cooperative.

We got one after getting a lawyer. When we first asked for an IEE the SD said no. The lawyer said that they cannot say no without taking you to due process (court) to prove their evaluation was appropriate. We mentioned this and suddenly the school approved it. Note that the evaluator is your choice, our SD tried to control our evaluator. However, an IEE is not magic, the evaluator still has to find that your son qualfies for special ed, and for services. And then you have to fight for those. Our IEE has been on-going for a year now. But the alternative is nothing.</p><p>My suggestion is to say that you are going to do it and then go ahead. If at all possible pay first and accept that you might not be reimbursed after. Getting the SD out of your evaluator\'s hair is probably worth it. Also get an evaluator that does not need SD clients in the near future.<br></p><p>We suspect that in the end we will have to go to due process.

'I used to work at a place with adults with a dual MI MR diagnosis and <br />from time to time we had to restrain people for safety. We had very <br />frequent and thorough workshops on this - it was heavily regulated. <br />I\'d call your schools resource room or better the districts special ed staff <br />and ask them what their policy and training on restraints is. If your son <br />witnessed something that seems to go against policy you might want to <br />document it. <br />I witnessed a kid at my ds\'s scool being restrained. It is a mainstream <br />school and it was pretty clear to me that the staff had no knowledge and <br />training on how to do this safely (at the time that kid posed a clear <br />danger to others). I did talk to the principal and the resource room about <br />that and they did get an FBA for the kid and training for staff. However a <br />special ed program should have proper training already in place. <br />Unsafe restraints are not just damaging and demeaning to the child and <br />other kids who watch it (not to talk about physically dangerous to anyone <br />involved) but also put the disrict at high risk of getting sued. Hopefully <br />they would want to know so they can offer proper training and <br />documentation for their staff. <br /><div class=\'post_sig\'>- micki, mom to three wonderful and wild kids.  ds 10 asperger & anxiety  twin dds 6 quirky but NT this far</div>'

'My response was based on my belief that you live in New York State. I thought I remembered that you do. In NY, we are a \"dual enrollment\" state and even children who are parentally placed get FAPE through their Districts. If I am mistaken and you do not live in NY, you are correct. The minute you take your child out of the school district, you give up FAPE. In fact, under \"equitable services,\" the school district does not have to give an individual child a single thing - they just have to devote a certain percentage of their special education budget on giving services to kids who are parentally placed and those services can be decided arbitrarily by the district. For example, they can decide to pay for computers for students with IEPs to use in the local Catholic school rather than give a single related service to any individual child. It\'s up to the Distict. Of course, most Districts try to give some individual services but those are limited to the required budget, not your child\'s individual needs. You may have far less of a leg to stand on if you live outiside of NY'

'You ask for a functional behavioral assessment of flapping (or some other behavior). There has to be a goal on his IEP that says something like \"the student will reducing flapping by 50%.\" Then they take a baseline score and they COUNT THE FLAPS. It\'s pretty simple. There should be tons of goals already on his IEP. Has he met them? If not, why not. If not, what are they proposing to do so that he WILL meet them? I would not focus on at-home issues at the moment if you can show that school issues are not improving, either. Also, every parent has the right to ask that parent training be included on the IEP so that you can take the techniques used successfully with him in school and implement them at home. If they are claiming he has none of these behaviors in school (which COULD be correct), they STILL have to provide you with parent training so you can be taught to reduce them at home. There is SO much that our kids have the right to but the only way any one of us is going to know WHAT those rights are is to read the law, go to advocacy workshops (sometimes there are some online), read books about the subject. It\'s really impossible for me or anyone else to type it all out here. Another good resource is the Autism Society of AMerica. There may well be a local chapter near you. Try to get in touch with them. YOu may be able to get good parent advocacy training through them.'

'As the previous poster said, it\'s important to figure out WHAT is causing <br />him to become escalated and upset. (An FBA should be able to determine <br />this). This would help you know how to avoid this situation or to remedy <br />it. <br /> <br />Having a visual of what to do when he\'s becoming upset is a great idea. <br />Another thing might be to have a card on his desk that says \"Break\" or <br />\"Help Please\" or \"Water Fountain\" - something that he can use to non- <br />verbally request a \"time out\" from the situation. Even though he is verbal, <br />he probably loses most of his verbal language during meltdowns, like a <br />lot of kids with autism do. <br /> <br />Something that helps in my classroom is to distract before the escalation <br />gets worse... as in, I will send the child to the restroom, or to go get the <br />stapler for me, or to run and check my mailbox. \"Quick, quick! Hurry and <br />get the stapler.\" Sometimes this works because the child forgets about <br />what they were getting upset about (or I have time to remedy it real quick, <br />such as erase a wrong answer or get the red crayon that was missing). <br /> <br />A \"choice board\" of appropriate things to do is something we also use. <br />Have you ever heard of Green Choices and Red Choices? I use a variation <br />of this in my classroom. Basically, the child or teacher can create a <br />board/page that shows green (good) choices and red (bad) choices in <br />different situations. This can be to varying degrees of reading abilities <br />(visuals - photographs or line drawings up to written or typed words and <br />stick figures). <br /> <br /><a href=\"http://www.redandgreenchoices.com/samplematerials.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Sample <br />s of Red Choices Green Choices</a> <br /> <br />You can also use a little tally mark system, red choices green choices, and <br />earn marks on either side. As the previous poster mentioned, the \"stress\" <br />of earning things can sometimes not work well for kids. Sometimes it can <br />be a good motivator, and if it is used in a way that the child is trying to <br />just do their best and not earn a certain amount in a defined period of <br />time, that helps too. <br /> <br />What about sensory items? Does the child have access to any sensory <br />items? Sometimes a stress ball (fancy that!) can do well in these types of <br />situations because it\'s something to get your anger out on that is not as <br />disruptive or dangerous. Silly putty is also good to have around, not just <br />for meltdowns but just to be squeezing throughout down times in class <br />and getting sensory input. <br /> <br />What about a visual schedule, or visuals to determine what\'s going on? <br />Maybe he is frustrated because he wants something else, or because he <br />doesn\'t know what\'s happening? You can use any array of visuals to help <br />the child know what comes next in his day. First we\'re going to work, <br />then we will go to lunch. Just a thought! <br /> <br />Another thing that I\'ve found is awesome (the power of visuals!!!) is using <br />digital pictures of appropriate behaviors. Showing my students \"Wow! I <br />am SO proud when you do your work like you are doing in THIS PICTURE.\" <br /> <br />or \"Look how quiet the room is! Look how you\'re sitting so nicely in the <br />chair. That makes me happy when you sit like that.\" <br /> <br />Also, remember that I teach elementary school so you may have to modify <br />your language or visuals <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"> <div class=\'post_sig\'>-   \"We should not strive to change the child with autism to fit the learning environment; rather we need to change the learning environment to fit the learning characteristics of the child.\" (TEACCH)</div>'

'<P>Hello everyone. I did a search and came across this board. This is my first post and I\'m hoping that I can have some input on my situation. I\'m the mom of a 12yr old 7th grader. He is autistic and attends a K-8 school in Central, FL. He is a high functioning self-contained classroom. His teacher is wonderful. He had her last year and there were 6 students in his classroom. She had one assistant.</P> <P>This year is horrible. She has 10 students and 2 assistants. She expressed her concerns about the number of students. She said she can\'t spend as much time as she would like to with each student. One of the main concerns is that there is a 5th grade student who is low functioning that has been placed in her classroom. I\'ve observed the classsroom. He is constantly crying and disruptive. I can see that a lot of time is spent with him calming him down. This takes away from the classwork. This contant crying and outburts is also upsetting my son. The noise is a factor. People with autism are senitive to loud noises. Also it is hard for him to concentrate on his schoolwork. This is not a large classroom. </P> <P>My plan of action. I have talked to the school RCS. She agrees with everything. She said the 5th grader was placed there as an administrative add on and she has no control over it. I told her that I was going to talk with the county. She agreed. Monday, I\'m call the county Autistic Program Specialist and the Director of E.S.E. I\'m also going to speak to the Principal. I\'m going to repeat what I\'ve written here. I would welcome any suggestions on how to handle this. </P> <P>Thank you!</P> <P> </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Florida</div>'

'<P>MANDT is an excellent program, I was recertified for years. It focuses on how to de-escalate situations and behaviors and avoid aggression and physical contact. If ALL of the strategies fail and DANGER is present, and physical contact cannot be avoided, MANDT also teaches how to interact physically without force, how to be mentally healthy and calm during the interactions, and how to prevent further injury when someone is aggressive. Without training, people who react to a physical aggression are likely to do more harm by grabbing smaller joints like hands or wrists, pulling on a limb, or pulling away from a hair pull or bite. I think this type of training is very important and I have had many severely aggressive kids and I have had to use everything I learned.</P> <P>I do not believe in anything called exclusionary time out under any circumstances. I have experienced situations where kids need to be separate from the rest of the class for the following reasons: 1. offensive and scary profane language during a meltdown 2. scaring or physically threatening other students 3. to protect the student\'s dignity during a meltdown In those situations, I have a small separate room where I accompany the child together with another staff person (so there are 3 of us in the room). We go there and wait quietly until the meltdown is over. If it helps, we provide calming strategies such as pressure or backrub- but most often the child de escalates somewhat, we praise that effort, and when totally calm, we return to the group. I have seen this type of space work wonders for some kids because I reduce all of the sensory input- it is quiet there, little visual stimulation, and can even be made somewhat dim (not really dark though) if that helps. The reduced sensory input is a big factor in helping calming.</P> <P>Finally the behavior management plan is backwards. It should not be identifying how the consequences get worse and worse (miss breaks, call home) for behaviors. Instead it should identify the strategies used to PREVENT behaviors, and the positive motivators used to encourage desired behaviors: earn a ticket or star every time a desired behavior is observed (frequently but random too) and have trade-ins scheduled throughout the day to \"buy\" snacks or free time with the tickets or stars.</P>'

'We have social challenges in our circumstances. The smaller school setting helps facilitate a more controlled environment of children, families and teachers. The tailoring of teaching to each childs need seems to work so much better. It is a lot of work and effort but our children are worth it! Involvement, monitoring and coaching proper behavior between we the parents and the teacher is so much more effective in a smaller setting (in my opinion and circumstance). Progression has been slow but moving forward year after year. I wish there were a pill but investing in a more focused and customized attention via a school setting sounds like a great long term investment in our kids! Good Luck and God Bless.'
'I suggest asking Tyoza on this one. As far as I am aware if you put in writing that you would like the reports then they have 48 hours to respond and get them to you. If you are being avoided by the teacher I would be calling the district special ed person and asking to have them get the reports and also make a visit to the classroom to observe what\'s happening. I would also suggest just as Pierced did make an unannounced visit to the classroom. Our school district has a statement that they want 24 hour notice. I would just go and not give them notice if you don\'t feel that your child is being treated correctly or that something is wrong. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Courage is being scared to death - and saddling up anyway! -John Wayne    Mom to two beautiful boys with ASD ages six and nine</div>'

'<P>Let me clarify what IDEA 2004 says about parents who \"parentally place\" a child. That means, parents who are placing a child in a private school for which THEY are paying tuition and/or parents who are homeschooling their children (this is considered a type of private school.) </P> <P>State laws vary (my own state, NY, is a \"dual enrollment\" state, for example, so what I\'m about to write does not apply in NY). However, Fed law says that school districts are off the hook for FAPE if the parents ultimately refuse the new IEP once all negotiations are over and have decided to refuse the new IEP by NOT accepting the new placement and removing their child from school at THEIR expense. Of course, the parents THEN have Due Process recourse, but in the meantime, the school is NOT obligated to provide FAPE. The parents have to send a 10 day letter seeking reimbursement for their paid tuition and the school has 10 days to answer that challenge before the parents need to file for Due Process if they want this argument to continue. If they DON\'T file for Due Process (mediation, resolution session, Hearing, etc.), the school IS off the hook for FAPE. However that doesn\'t mean it won\'t pay for something, but that is UP TO THEM. They are REQUIRED to pay for something called \"equitable services\" which means they have to devote a percentage of their sped budget to privately placed kids, in general, but not necessarily to any one child. It\'s up to them. Clearly, the last time you homeschooled your child, they decided to provide him with something. This time they are not. You recourse is formal Due Process, which I assume your advocate will advise you about. Of course, your STATE law can be different, but what I post here is the minimum required by the Feds. </P> <P>Anyone on this forum who takes their child out of public school into some kind of private education (including homeschooling) MUST go to their state ed website to find out the specifics of what that particular STATE says about private placements at parental expense. Each state is different. What I\'ve posted here is from IDEA 2004. Of course, all things are negotiable in any state, but this is what IDEA REQUIRES. No more. When you got a change to your son\'s IEP, that meant that your negotiations hadn\'t yet gotten to the \"take it or leave it\" point. If the negotiations DO get to that point and you decide to \"leave it\" and pull your child, according to IDEA 2004, the school district IS off the hook for FAPE for that year. However, they MUST hold another IEP meeting next year and allow you to accept THAT one.</P> <P>Please print out this post to show to your advocate. If he finds any of this to be incorrect based on IDEA 2004, please post that here. I certainly don\'t mind standing corrected if I\'m wrong. However, this information came directly from the law as well as a confirmation from an Impartial Hearing Officer who teaches the intense advocacy course I just completed. My guess is that your advocate has found something in your state\'s law that is different.</P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by tzoya on May 18 2007 at 5:02am</span>'
'<font size=\"2\">I think both of you have good points. Right now, my son (IMO) will<br>benefit most from having good peer role models. He does learn from<br>being around them. Now, in future, he may have trouble actually<br>learning in a typical environment and may need a SE placement. For<br>preschool there is no learning except language and social skills, and<br>a setting of 3 kids is not the right setting for him. I can supplement<br>his day with a day care with lots of typical kids, but how does that<br>help him? He goes from all free play with 24 kids ( where he actually<br>made two \"friends\" today ) to a class of 2 other kids who don\'t talk <br>much, and I don\'t see how that helps. I wish there could be a play<br>therapist helping him in a typical preschool/day care instead. That <br>would be much more useful. I guess preschoolers are still young <br>enough not to care about the kid with the aide. <br><br>Tzoya, great advice about asking them for a date by which the <br>placement must have some inclusion component, because otherwise<br>they keep telling me that this is a new class and things will take time<br>to set up and so on. <br><br>Thanks<br></font>'

'<P>Actually, if your read the regs it does not say daily speech therapy. It says daily language instruction*. In some cases, the entire class gets specific language instruction from an SLP or someone else with strong language training and that can count. However, if it\'s the whole class, that \"session\" can\'t be for more than 6 kids at once and it has to be at least an hour long. So, if your child is in a 12-1-1, the therapist can\'t work with more than half the class at a time. And since these groups have to contain kids with similar needs in order to be appropriate, it\'s the rare situation in which the \"therapy\" can simply be class time. Just wanted to give people a heads up about this \"loophole.\" The other thing is that just because our kids CAN get so much speech it doesn\'t mean that, on an individual basis, they all NEED this much speech or can even benefit. Sometimes, for kids whose actual speech is OK but who need lots of pragmatics, it\'s better to consider a group social skills session with a psychologist or social worker as part of what constitutes their language instruction. All of this has to be individualized to the child. </P> <P> </P> <P><strong><EM>*(4) Instructional services shall be provided to meet the individual language needs of a student with autism for a minimum of 30 minutes daily in groups not to exceed two, or 60 minutes daily in groups not to exceed six.</EM></strong></P>'

'The use of a Rifton chair by this teacher is inexcusable. I have spent a lot of years researching and teaching behavioral management in children with autism, and my biggest issue is how restrictive devices are used to \"contain\" behaviors. The restrictive model is very much like how some people kennel a dog because they are not able to potty train them. So to prevent the behavior, they keep them locked up, but how does that help the dog learn to function within their home?<br><br>Unfortunately, we often take the same approach with these kids. We \"kennel\" them in order to prevent the behaviors that we fear; and so these restrictive strategies are really more self-serving than beneficial to the child. A child\'s progress is based on their ability to adapt. These great kids cannot learn to adapt if they are not able to engage in their environments and be challenged. And so we should not be restricting them, but challenging them (the JUST RIGHT CHALLENGE, of course) to help them learn skills. This way, they can become more adaptive to their surroundings and guess what? Their behaviors diminish, they become more functional, and most importantly, their quality of life skyrockets because greater adaptability is consistent with better processing, less rigid and more abstract play and social interaction, and that opens the window of opportunity to for them to learn skills and become more and more independent. I have worked with older kids and younger adults who have grown up in the restrictive model and besides having fewer resources once they graduate from school, many of their issues persist!<br><br>Now as far as the Rifton chair, it is a good device when used properly to help a child understand boundaries as well as to help him/her with modulation, BUT that is when it is properly used in a therapeutic environment. The use of the chair in this case is simply to help this teacher restrict the child\'s behaviors. The sad truth is a lot of these teachers may mean well, but most of them, as well as therapists, do not have the education to really work through these effectively accept what they think is right because that is what everyone else does. It is time to redefine the educational and therapeutic models so that we can better prepare these kids for the future and NOT just to help everyone survive the day.<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Joel Desotelle, MS OTR/L  Edlantis Seminars, Inc.  www.edlantis.com  Dedicated to the advancement of rehabilitation for children with autism</div>'

I am sorry to sound direct with you, but I experienced the same issues with my daughter. Althrough, I never requested the school district to perform the swallow study test. I went to the nearest feeding clinic or childrens hospital that had therapist that specialized in this area..</P> <P>After doing this, I provided a copy of the swallow study and any other doctor note(s) to the school. They were aware of her feeding issues and the documentation from the doctors on file to back this up. You have to be very careful with the school district and how they use the medical note(s) you provide them. Because, they can put many restrictions and may require a note from the doctor for everything/anything other than listed by the doctor for feeding. So, this causes you to go back and forth with the dr to obtain these notes. </P> <P>Unless you really trust your school district, I would not sign an open medical release of records, this will even cause more issues and they will try to obtain note(s) from the doctors, which will benefit them..And you might not be aware of this, until you sit in the meeting and try to get this fixed...

I think the chance for us with Nina was far higher than 10% but for some people without the family history before their child the chance might be less<br> <span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Allegra on September 03 2007 at 11:20pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>-    Sharlet 7 ASD (mod-sev), Nina 5 Still unknown.</div>'
'<P>I am so lost and I\'m hoping someone here can point me in the right direction. My son is 3 years and 7 months, he was recently diagnosed ASD and just started in a state preschool 3 weeks ago. They have a speech therapist there so I asked her what to do and she told me that she\'d do a speech screening on his...he failed so now she said that she\'ll do a full speech evaluation on him sometime in the next few weeks. She told me that once she has done the full evaluation and knows the results, if he fails she has 60 days to do an IEP. I thought she had 60 days from the day I first requested the initial screening but she said no. I then told her that we were going to request a physco-educational evaluation (even though I\'m not even sure what this is!!) from the school district and that I thought they had 60 days from the day of my receiving my request in writing to do this. I thought that then we\'d be looking at October to do one full IEP for everything. She basically told us not to bother (she knows my son is autistic), she said it\'s best to just do the speech and the speech IEP first.</P> <P>I\'m so confused, I don\'t really even understand what the IEP is anyway or what it would even do for my son. He is doing okay in preschool, I really like his teacher but there is only her and two aides in the room of about 24 children aged between 2 and 5 years old (mixed preschool class). My son Nate has been hitting other children, he has a hard time transitioning, he can\'t stand in line with the other children, he has no interest in circle time and he does not play or interact with the other kids in the class.</P> <P>Help...I\'m lost, I have no idea what we should be doing, what our rights are, or what we should be requesting for our son.</P> <P>Louise</P>'

'In many states, a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">written </span>request to evaluate triggers a time line which they have to meet. If they don\'t, you can file a compliance complaint which might get them to act. But in your case this appears to be water over the dam. If you were to file a complaint all you\'d get (IMHO) is the evaluation and you are getting that.<br><br>IMHO there is nothing you can do to the school district to stop them from trying to do it again. What you can do for your kid is to do everything in writing (create a paper trail) and research the time lines in your state.

'If your child is not of COMPULSORY school age (this varies by state, but it\'s usually around 6), you can simply go to the District and sign him out. Otherwise, you will need a physician to write a letter somehow documenting that your child is too ill to go to school and must be instructed at home. You can also follow your state\'s guidelines for Homeschooling, which vary from state to state. YOU CANNOT SIMPLY TAKE HIM OUT OF SCHOOL. If you do, the District can call Child Protective Servcies and CPS can charge you with Educational Neglect (if your child is between 6 and 16 in most states). Good luck with your new District. <span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by tzoya on April 10 2008 at 3:22am</span>'
'Here\'s what you have to weigh. Yes, schools can be a better place to <br />learn behavior management, but sadly, many fail in this department. It\'s <br />just a fact that some schools are better equipped to serve special <br />education students than other schools are. Some are very progressive, <br />others have no clue. And of course, the same is true for all students. <br />Kids in better economic areas tend to get a higher quality education. Not <br />always, but it\'s mostly true because of the way schools are funded in this <br />country. <br /> <br />What you have to consider is, can I do a better job serving him in all the <br />areas he needs help? For me, the answer was yes, here where I am now. <br />In my dd\'s last school, they had more to offer and were able (and willing) <br />to work with my dd as an individual, and not try to plug her into some <br />program that was convenient to them. She succeeded in that <br />environment. But here, it was another story, she regressed terribly so I <br />decided to homeschool and it\'s been going well. <br /> <br />My advice is to research what is out there. Are there social groups (both <br />special needs and/or homeschool) that he could join. Also, don\'t <br />discount your own ability to facilitate his community outings. Personally, <br />I think schools are among the worse places to learn proper socialization, <br />because a) it\'s seldom facilitated and a lot of bad behavior is learned, <br />and b) it\'s mostly discouraged, unless you have a progressive school that <br />uses group and differentiated learning in its classrooms. <br /> <br />Good luck and feel free to PM me if you want more info. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to beautiful 10-yr old twin girls,1 w/Autism, 1 NT(w/ speech delays to age 5)</div>'

'<P>First of all, if your son needs an aide 3 times a week, he needs one 5 times per week. If he doesn\'t need an aide, he doesn\'t need an aide. I would caution against having a aide if he really doesn\'t need one because kids can become aide dependent and that leads to less independence, not more. ASK them why they think he needs an aide at all and, if so, why only 3 days a week. Sometimes kids get what is known as half an aide. That means there is one adult who aides two kids. But that is 5 days a week.</P> <P>ALWAYS bring all your questions. This cannot be an official IEP meeting if you did not receive a written invitation at least 5 days prior. That is the law. This could be a pre-IEP meeting, meaning that the team is meeting (and parents are members of the team) to iron out questions BEFORE the IEP meeting so that the official meeting can run smoothly. OFtentimes, Districts set aside only certain days during the month for official IEP meetings. On those days, the meeting are scheduled tightly, so it\' better to have a premeeting.</P> <P>Let us know how it goes.</P>'

'<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>Dear Lee: How neat to talk (via the internet) to someone clear down in Australia<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley17.gif\" border=\"0\">!I\'m very glad to hear your story and your concerns about your little son Luke. It is not easy raising an autistic child by yourself, but it can be done. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>It is neat you have such good bus service for your little guy. And it is good that he loves his school and is doing great.<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"></FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>I don\'t know anything about Dexamphetamine, but I\'ll try to find out and study its pros and cons. I\'m wondering if it\'s a psychadelic drug like Rytallin, Paxil, Zoloft, etc. Dr. Ann Tracy (a gifted doctor who gives many radio talks and speeches) considers these psychadelic drugs to be very bad (with their side effects and all) for anybody to take, let alone little children.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>In my younger years I worked as a secretary in a mental institution and saw and read the effect drugs had on the patients. The staff would change their drugs on a whim, just to see what it would do to them. It drove them blooming crazy! The only ones that I saw who improved enough and were able to leave were those put in nearby half-way houses and given a semblance of independence, responsibility, and self-worth.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>Your little guy is probably reacting to the reality that he is different and limited in what he can do. I can imagine he has a lot of pent-up anger and frustration-which is understandable. My Mark also went through some hard times when he had to face the reality that \"he was different and limited in what he could do, especially when combined with his inability to communicate his frustrations and understand why he was different. Also, he was probably suffering some real pain-probably as a result of headaches and other damaged areas of his brain and body, and not eating very well. I remember one time (when Mark was about 8 or or 9) the bus driver was honking his horn for me to come out. Mark was out of control and was biting his arms and nearly drawing blood. When I got him inside, I let him know in no uncertain terms that he was never to do that again. That he had to learn to deal with his disability and never get out of control again! So, he never did after that, although when Mark was 10 or 11 or so, and was being difficult and refused to eat his pizza at a restaurant, and he said to me in a very angry voice, \"What did you do to me?\" I stated to him that I believed his vaccination shots he had when he was a baby caused damage to his brain, and that I was too trusting, and that I was very sorry.<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"> He seemed to accept my explanation and over the years appears to have come to terms with his disability. I told him, \"I\'m your friend and I can help you and teach you how to do new things and be there for you, so you\'ll be all right, so don\'t worry!\" </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>I don\'t have any idea what the increased dosage or withdrawal from Dexamphetamine will do to your little guy, Luke. It doesn\'t sound very good that he is having to have an increased dosage. Dr. Tracy says it is very important to reduce their meds a tiny bit at a time until they off them completely. She also states many deaths have been caused by these drugs because it makes them flip out and be out of control and lose their minds, and she has had to testify at their trials about the dangers of these drugs and what they can do.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>So, if it were me, after an extensive investigation of the pitfalls of Dexamphetamine, and if I found it to be deleterious to his health and well being, I would probably slowly take him off this drug and substantially step up his Vitamin C, plus a little calcium and magnesium, and other natural vitamins, and see that he eats plenty of fruits and vegetables, and especially check into foods high in \"B\" vitamins (for his nerves). I\'ve heard Brewers Yeast is high in the \"B\" vitamin group. You are the parent, and you have the upper hand, so don\'t be afraid to discipline him in a positive way in order to get the desired results and save his sanity.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>Sadly, our legislators are trying to limit our ability to obtain vitamins and supplements. So, for our health\'s sake this must be stopped. Something called, \"Codex\". You can find more about this at <A href=\"http://www.healthfreedomusa.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.healthfreedomusa.org</A> and <A href=\"http://www.familyvsstate.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.familyvsstate.org</A>. You can send an email (which they\'re counting and keeping track of) through these websites to Congress and state your concerns about their bill/intent to limit our freedom and abilities to choose for ourselves by severely limiting the amount and kinds of vitamins and supplements that are available. This is that important, and it\'s probably even happening in Australia! Please let me know how you and your little guy are doing.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>P.S., I love your phrases that I\'ve never heard before, like \"out of the box\" and, \"it worked like a treat\". <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley36.gif\" border=\"0\"></FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2> </FONT></P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Best Regards, Marge</div>'

'<P>We sent our son to a mainstream pre-school a few months after he turned 3 (his birthday is in June). At the time, we didn\'t suspect autism. He had a few repetitive behaviors (not obvious ones), some obsessions and didn\'t interact much with peers - although he did some. </P> <P>I am grateful we did. He wasn\'t potty-trained, but others weren\'t either (although they were by the end of the year and my ds wasn\'t). He just wore a pull-up and it was no big deal. He never pooped except at home. </P> <P>If we would have known about his autism, we could have had more supports in the classroom for him - but we were fortunate and the teachers really did everything they knew to do for him. He liked going there and I think it helped him progress socially. One little girl really took to him and they had a love-hate relationship for the whole year - actually, two years since they were in the same class the next year. That relationship alone taught him a lot about interacting with kids. We got to talk about a new thing about friendship every single day!</P> <P>That\'s a tough one. I would prefer to see a child with younger or same-age peers. Older ones are likely to baby him and I\'m not sure what he will get out of learning social interactions from that. Don\'t they have an ECSE program he could attend?</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS (9 yo) diagnosed with mild PDD-NOS and DD (6 yo) NT - but definitely a challenge!</div>'

'beccaposie - Your son DOES qualify for an IEP. Get an advocate. His stimming IS affecting his education. \"Education\" is NOT just grades and passing. It says so in black and white in IDEA 2004. You NEED advocacy help. Even under 504, they MUST to an FBA and BIP if that is what your son needs in order to access an education. If you have not had legal help to get your son the IEP he needs, do so as soon as possible. Every day without the help of an IEP is a school day wasted in this environment.'

'<P>Okay, so Will\'s evals were done.....the letter I sent to the head of SPED and my numerous calls and conversations - plus the documentation and evals that were done and that I had provided for them mad a difference!</P> <P>They have, BEFORE THE IEP (which is TUESDAY) agreed to keep on his current ABA therapist til July 14th (that\'s when the summer program will begin)!</P> <P>I guess, for around here in MA, that\'s UNHEARD of! BUT, I am relentless and I made some valid points.....so at least they listened this far....but I am still going to fight (especially since I got to see what 2 weeks w/o ABA did to him) for ABA to continue along with the summer and regular school program. </P> <P>Can anyone prepare me for the IEP meeting?</P> <P>What should I ask?</P> <P>I went to view the classroom that he would most likely be in and WHOA there are DEFINATELY not enough people in that room to cover Will and his impulsiveness...I\'d be worried that he\'d slip out of the room or get hurt/hurt someone else b/c he got upset and they were too busy. I mean, the ratio wouldn\'t be bad if the classroom was smaller - but it\'s 15 kids max (and it is max by the end of the year for sure) to 1 teacher and 2 para\'s (none of which have ANY ABA training nevermind certifications). It is an integrated classroom so it\'s 1/2 special needs and 1/2 mainstream. It just seemed like, if, on a bad day for kids in the classroom - Will would definately be at a huge risk.</P> <P>There was one kid who was low functioning autistic - he ddin\'t even have a 1:1 - and it was SO sad to see that the teachers TRIED to help him make eye contact and so on - but they had to work with the other kids too - and so, HE suffered b/c of it.....I was sad and angry that there was a HUGE possibility that this child could slip through the cracks - that he wasn\'t given the full opportunity to blossom.</P> <P>It made me want to really work hard to get the proper services for Will - so he didn\'t slip through the cracks....but it also made me realize that maybe my calling in life is to help other families make sure that the services they need are in place......so no child is left behind.....</P> <P>Anyway....enough about my ramblings......</P> <P>Any suggestions?<BR>I made a list of safety concerns.....mostly concerning running away, no sense of danger, choking (due to pouching/stuffing of food), food allergy (severe to milk) and outbursts that are unpredictible.

'My 3rd grade daughter is in a classroom with 32 children this year. 7 of which are \"highly functioning autistic children\". I apologize for not knowing the terminology and am asking for help in understanding the situation. Where I have used quotes I am using the terms used by our principal. <br /> <br />My frustration is that the parents of the \"normal\" kids were not informed of the situation. Until I got home from work and my daughter told us there were some kids that were different in her room, I had no idea. She described how some kids don\'t talk, some shout out, some don\'t move the same as most and I suspected what it was (all the districts autistic children are \"housed\" at our school). Then the phone started ringing. Parents wondering what is going on and what to think about it. Protective loving parent who are scared that their children will be \"shortchanged\" and fall behind. I try to be open minded and decided rather that speculate and join the mob mentality I called the Principal. <br /> <br />I asked him to define the situation which he did. When I said I think the school could have averted a whole lot of frustration and yes, anger from some, if they had let us know ahead of time the situation, he had no response. He did say that the families of the autistic children knew and the school had been working with them over the last year to understand the transition and make sure they felt comfortable and knew the school was there to support them. Why couldn\'t they do the same with the families of the so called \"normal\" kids? I am not opposed to the situation, I just want to understand it. I want to understand what the school is going to do to help the \"normal\" kids understand and adjust to the situation. When I asked, the principal he just said they did it last year and it worked out wonderfully. Great, but what exactly did they do? Define wonderful. I am just as nervous and unsure as the parents of the autistic children in the classroom. <br /> <br />I understand IEPs (my older son was severely speech delayed and we worked with an IEP for 4 years) were prepared for the autistic children, but where is the plan for the \"normal\" children? In my opinion, to make this situation work, both \"sides\" need to have a plan. Otherwise the \"normal\" kids may reject, baby, make fun of the autistic children, resent them etc (and same with the parents). I want my daughter to understand that every person is different, special, and a gift to the world and each other. Every person has gifts and something wonderful, productive, creative, etc. to offer the world. Every person has traits we like and don\'t like and that many of those are out of our control. But I can\'t help feeling like I don\'t know how to address her questions and needs in the situation. <br /> <br />I am sure that many parents of autistic and other \"special needs\" children feel the same frustration. The same helplessness and lack of support. It is so sad that in order to protect privacy we can\'t have open, honest discussions on the topic. Why is it so wrong for the parents of the \"normal\" children to ask, what does this mean to my chid, without feeling like we are being insensitive. It is normal to be concerned and unsettled. <br /> <br />So basically, I am asking for your help understanding the pros and cons, or maybe it isn\'t even pros and cons but rather how are the kids similar and different? What can the autistic children learn from my child and what can my child learn from them? I think this is a wonderful and exciting opportunity for her to expand her horizons and embrace people who are different from her. All I have been able to really say is to basically understand there are differences and to use the tools she has used with any other child and if it doesn\'t work, to see if an adult can help. I told her it is ok to be irritated at times as she would with any other chid. It is ok to not understand the situation and ask the teachers and us for help in understanding. It is ok to like the autistic kids or not as long as it is after she has made an effort to get to know them as she would any other child. I told her there might be some she likes and some she doesn\'t and that is ok too. <br /> <br />I would love to have recommenations on age appropriate books, role playing, websites, anything you have come across that might assist me in understanding and guiding my child this year. <br /> <br />Thank you!'

'My son cannot pay attention unless he is motivated by someone 1:1. So, mainstream preschool is out of question until he learns to pay attention in a group situation. So, I am thinking of doing ABA and special ed preschool initially and once he learns to pay attention better, I am planning to put in main stream preschool part time (3 days a week for 3 days) so that he can generalize and relate to NT environment. I may have a shadow for some time until he can function independently in an NT preschool.'
'<P>I only know the rules in NY. Each state is different, especially if there is a school choice situation. You MUST check with your state. Your child is legally REQUIRED to receive a Free and Appropriate Public Education. If your state allows school choice, it MUST have rules about how to ensure your child\'s FAPE in WHATEVER public placement he\'s in. You might need to check with a lawyer on this if you can\'t get the State Ed Dept. to give you a straight answer. The one thing I KNOW is that, whatever choice you make (as long as it is not a private placement paid by you), your child had the right to all the supports and services he needs to get to access educational benefit (academic, physical, communication/social and behavioral). </P> <P>In some states, it is possible for one public school district to make money from tuition paid by another public school district. I don\'t mean in the sense that a business makes a profit (obviously , a public entity is non-profit) but in the sense that they can pass on more than their out-of pocket cost. HOwever, cross-districting can be very complicated, so many school districts refuse to accept tuition paying students in states that don\'t REQUIRE that they accept out of district students.</P>'

'<P>Mr. B is in a stand-alone special needs pre-school, transitioning to mainstream kindergarten next year. We have a three-ring notebook that goes back/forth to school daily. It\'s divided into three sections - Daily, Parent/Teacher Notes, and Social Stories.</P> <P>Under Daily, I have a form that has pictures of all of the various activities they would be doing in the classroom, as well as a small section for comments and \"Who I played with today\". All the teacher has to do is circle the activities for the day, note who he played the most with, and give me info on toilet training issues. Anything else more indepth we need to address gets put in the Parent/Teacher Notes. It\'s quick, doesn\'t take much time for her to do, and I\'ve found them much more willing to do something like that than spend more time filling (writing) out the various things.</P> <P>The \"Social Stories\" section changes, depending on what we\'re having issues with. I\'ve included social stories using pictures for the teachers to use with him as they need to: \"Circle Time\", \"Use My Words,\" \"Taking Turns,\" \"School Rules\" are the ones there right now, as those are the areas of behavior concerns. It\'s simply another tool for his team to use in a format similar to what is used at home.</P> <P>Because of communication issues in a previous district, I made sure to have it written into the IEP that communication is done daily using the notebook by the teaching staff. In addition, the therapy team has their own that comes home on his intensive therapy day - they just put it in the notebook for me. And, of course, we email regularly, and try to meet informally as a team every 6 weeks or at least right after the report cards come out.</P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by AnamCara on February 02 2009 at 10:10am</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- COPAA Advocate Member,MPact Mentor, single parent to 4 ages 19 to 6, all with disabilities.

'In my experience, a school can be fantastic for one family and a nightmare for another. It has a lot to do with personal dynamics and who\'s on the IEP team, but also depends on the child\'s challenges. The more hidden their challenges are, the tougher it can be to get the school on board.<br><br>My point is that a school (or state\'s) reputation is just one factor to consider.

'<P>The school district is required to evaluate his academic progress. Ask for standardized reading testing, spelling testing, math testing. This will give you his CURRENT levels. That way, you will be able to gauge his progress for next year. Interventions on an IEP are based on Present Levels of Performance, so an accurate score for those areas is important. Once the school test (and IQ test is not necessary and IQ is the least of most kids\' problems), you can ask for an IEE to get a second opinion. Under IDEA 2004, parents can request and get a research-based, peer-reviewed reading program that addresses their child\'s particular issues. So finding OUT what those particular issues are is critical.</P> <P>If your child is having difficulty academically because of behaviors, he still needs a BIP. Pursue than angle, too.</P>'

'Bravo! This is a case that SHOWS how important it is to get EVERYTHING in writing in the IEP. An IEP is a LEGAL contract that the school district MUST fulfill. IF not, they can be cited by the state based on parent complaints. No district wants the state auditing them. You should be VERY proud of yourself. BTW - if they paid more than minimum wage, I bet they COULD get an aide. This is the free market at work. IF they can\'t hire for peanuts, they\'ll have to offer almonds.'
'Everybody at the disability advocacy center is horrified. It has captured the entire office\'s attention, and it\'s one of their main focuses at this time. They\'ve assigned 2 advocates to my son as well as an attorney. I\'m very thankful for that, but let me tell you..... I found out how hard it is to find help in my state. There is literally only one attorney in the state of TN who specializes in education law, and he\'s not in my city. It\'s really tough finding people to help when you\'re in trouble.'
'The Vineland is not for MR issues - it is for ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING issues. It is not an IQ measure - it measures how a child is able to perform in real life, day-to-day skills.

'I really don\'t get this one. What difference does it make to her?<br>You\'d think she\'d be happy that his water is in a spill proof cup.<br><br>Agreeing with above posters - between it being in his IEP and the doctor\'s note, she\'s required to let him have it. Go to the principal, special ed director (not sure what a CSE chair is that someone mentioned so I\'m guessing that is state specific?), superintendent if you have to.

Over the years OTs have also taken on sensory integration therapy. Some are well trained in the sensory part, and some are not. Insurance companies will not pay because they consider sensory integration treatment as \"experimental\". <br /> <br />What complicates things with the schools (and insurance companies) is that Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) is not an officially recognized disability. What usually happens is that a child qualifies for OT because of fine motor delays that affect the child in school. Then the OT will also help with the sensory stuff (but not always). <br /> <br />There are those working to add SPD to the DSM, but it is not currently. <br /> <br />My son no longer qualifies for OT at school because his fine motor is now acceptable. So, he has lost the sensory integation stuff at school (OT pull-out time plus the sensory diet during the school day). He used to have fine motor goals, but never sensory goals. I am sure there are more progressive schools that have actual sensory goals, but this is not the norm. <br /> <br />My daughter still has some fine motor delays and thus still has the OT support. She also has some accomodations in her IEP regarding loud noises (e.g. she sits in the back at assemblies). Maybe this is something you can discuss also. <br /> <br />So, if I were you I would become very familiar with Wrights\' Law (read \"From Emotions to Advocacy\"). This is important whether your child has autism or only SPD. Remember that a child has to have a disability AND it has to affect their education in order to have an IEP. So you will have to show that his sensory needs affect his education. <br /> <br />I would also read some books on sensory integration and start some activities at home. Some good books are \"The Out-of-Sync Child\" and \"Raising a Sensory Smart Child\". These books will help you to also advocate for your child. <br /> <br />Oh, one more thing. Ask the school OT for a Sensory Profile form for you to complete. At least you will have it documented for the IEP meeting, and you can discuss. <br /> <br />Best wishes. <br /> <br />- <br /> <br />mom to 9 year old boy/girl twins (Asperger\'s/PDD-NOS)'

'Your son sounds like my son\'s identical twin when my son was 11. He\'s now 15. I have to say that the years between 11 and 13 were BAD. There is SO much to address in your post that, really, it would be impossible to answer you here. The schools are clearly not giving your sone FAPE, a Free Appropriate Public Education. That is their JOB and they can be FORCED to provide him with what he needs. A huge majority if the ASD kids I know, particularly the higher functioning ones, cannot tolerate the atmosphere of a \"normal\" school. They need to have the same teacher (or only a couple) and that teacher has to be educated in autism. Typically, they need regular academic material but may need to be in a smaller, quieter atmophere to accomplish it. They need help with generalizing what they learn. They need to develop coping skills and organizational skills. Your school district is clearly not teaching your son what HE needs to learn, so they are OUT OF COMPLIANCE. If you post the state you live in, I will post the names of lawyers or advocates in your area. You really area going to NEED the help of someone who knows the law to straighten this mess out. It\'s criminal that our school system changes to the middle school system just as our kids need MORE attention because of the onset of puberty, not less. So please post where you live and I\'ll get you some contacts you can start with. I really, really know what you are going throug because my son went through the same stage. At 15, he\'s doing much, much better.'

'Let\'s go to the talk shows with all this issue. I would love to expose the truth about how Public school is failing our Special kids and the un fair treatment of kids with disabilities. Another big problem I see is politicians who don\'t have answers cause their kids all attend private schools. I also have a issue with hollywood stars and professional athletes who can afford the best experts in medical care while we sit back and have to take what we can get. I also believe it\'s un fair people like that get special help by the courts sytems unlike the real world. Why should those professionals get different stuff then hard working real world people. This shows money does by the best things in life. Sadly all material things can be hear right now and gone latter that day. Life\'s focus should be on helping the people not on just trying to out do other\'s you dislike or don\'t even now. To many people just have to do better than their neightbors.

My name is XXXXXX XXXX (\"Miss XXXXX\") and I will be <br />your child\'s XXXXXXX classroom teacher. I am excited about my first year <br />at the XXXXXX School. After graduating from XXXX XXXXX University, I <br />taught in XXXX for two years. Prior to teaching, I was an active volunteer <br />in an elementary classroom for children with autism. <br /> <br />I recently moved to XXXXX from XXXX. I taught in a moderate/severe self- <br />contained special education classroom in a public school district in <br />XXXXXX. During this time, I was also an in-home trainer for students with <br />autism. I gained extensive experience in this setting. Having the <br />opportunity to share my special education skills with my district <br />colleagues was a wonderful professional experience. While in XXXX, I <br />enjoyed volunteering with the Special Olympics. <br /> <br />My teaching philosophy is that every child brings special qualities to our <br />classroom. My teaching style provides a positive environment for all <br />students to learn through individualized activities specific to student <br />needs. I have a special interest in PECS and Augmentative Communication <br />and am always interested in integrating communication skills into our <br />day. <br /> <br />I also enjoy spending time with my husband, XXXX, and our four-year- <br />old yellow Labrador retriever, XXXXXX. We\'ve recently discovered the XXXX <br />XXXX \"Bark Park.\" We are excited about exploring XXXXX! <br /> <br />While I will try to keep the lines of communication open at all times, I will <br />be able to guarantee a response to parent e-mails and phone calls on <br />Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday afternoons between 2:45-and 3:45. If <br />there is a situation that warrants immediate communication in a special <br />circumstance, I will be in touch with you as necessary. I am looking <br />forward to working with you and your child this upcoming school year. If <br />you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Sincerely, <br /> <br />XXXXX XXXXX <br />XXXX School <br />555-555-5555 <br />xxxxx@school.com <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><div class=\'post_sig\'>-   \"We should not strive to change the child with autism to fit the learning environment; rather we need to change the learning environment to fit the learning characteristics of the child.\" (TEACCH)</div>'

'<P>FIrst of all, if the current special ed consultant is going to continue in that role, I think that a regular schedule of her going to the class is imperative. At this point, she is not supposed to work as a crisis counselor but as a trainer. Have you ever heard of trainings that happen only during crises? How would any of us like it if interns were only supervised by experienced doctors when there was a Code Blue? Training the staff requires regularly meeting with them and asking them to keep logs of what is working and what isn\'t. Ask for regularly scheduled time in the class for the consultant. If she doesn\'t have the time, that is when to ask for someone from the outside to come in since the school cannot meet your son\'s needs with just their on-staff personnel. </P> <P>About the recess situation. I would IMMEDIATELY call for a conference with the Spec. Ed. director and tell that person EXACTLY what happened. Get this resolved IMMEDIATELY. Frankly, I\'d ask for a different para. YOu might need for the consultant teacher to be in the meeting to get a feel from her as to whether this was an isolated incident, or something that may not be isolated but will improve with further training or if this para is not the one for your son. I wouldn\'t actually let it go until the IEP unless necessary. Then I would bring it up there but not be placated unless and until the team could come up with specific steps they plan on taking to get this para better educated.</P>'

'<P>Unless the schools in Florida are completely different than the ones here I am having a hard time believing that the school is offering the \"catering\" you are saying.</P> <P>A lot of parents of special needs children have to fight tooth and nail to get even a few services provided...therefore I can\'t see a school just sitting back and letting the parents run the show when it comes to their child, especially when the behaviors are as bad as you say.</P> <P>No it\'s not ok for this child to be hitting, biting etc. But he is a child with autism and this is a cry for help. He is trying to communicate something and the teachers are failing to understand. They aren\'t there to babysit, they are there to educate. It is a shame that you are saying that the rest of the class is suffering, but I look at it as bad teachers, not bad kid!!</P> <P>Maybe do some research...give them some suggestions...I was just told about something called FBA...someone comes to the school with the sole purpose to figure out what is causing the child to behave the way he is, then offer solutions to fix this problem.</P> <P>I\'m sorry if I am sounding harsh here also, but again this is very close to home for me. The only difference is the teachers in my sons case are trying to fix the problem. They remove him from the room if behaviors begin...they try to calm him and help him. My son is mainstreamed in a public school and they are finding ways to help him I would assume that a class specifically for children with autism would have the means to help him even more. </P> <P>I would stop and analyze the situation a little more before you run to a lawyer. Please take a look at how this school is handling the situation. If an aide might be available to help your child in mainstream classroom, why isn\'t their an aide for this boy to take him out of the classroom when these behaviors are occuring. It could be a million things from sensory to frustration...But by all means, my first thought would NOT be that this child lacks discipline or is just a brat.</P>'
'<P>Hi, my son is currently in Grade 3 in a regular mainstream classroom with help from an Education Assistant half the time.</P> <P>I\'m starting to wonder whether I should be homeschooling him. I think it would be less stressful. I know that he can do the work, but the school environment makes everything more complicated. He struggles socially, he wants friends but is struggling with appropriate play. His ticks are starting to get worse, I don\'t know if it is from the constant demands that school brings. I don\'t know, maybe I am just tired of the whole \"fight\" to make a square peg fit into a round hole. Do you know what I mean? I\'m just so tired of the effort and issues that keep coming up. It just seems so much easier to remove the school from our lives and let him learn at home where he won\'t be constantly judged or stand out as different.</P> <P>Have any of you switched from school to homeschool and how was the transition? Any regrets?</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- mom to cole 8 - pdd nos & jorja 4</div>'
'When we chose our LI school district, I was lucky enough to consult with a professional whose job was to evaluate special ed programs all over New York State. She recommended Half Hollow Hills as a great district. We wound up buying in Harborfields which she also suggested. (We wanted to be a little closer to the water and in a smaller town and school.) But, from what this woman told me, HHH is the gold standard for special ed.

'<br />One thing that the OT should plan is a sensory diet appropriate for your child. Try to get this implemented early on. Would be quick sensory activities (e.g. chair pushups)that would be implemented throughout the day (not just after being overstimulated). The idea is to keep the child regulated throughout the day to be able to handle more sensory input. If there is an an aide, the aide can be trained to implement as per a defined schedule. <br /> <br />Don\'t know anything about medication. However, since we have started biomedical intervention, she seems to be doing better with sounds. She has also had private and school OT for about 5 years, which has helped tremendously. Now she just has school OT. Sounds are still hard for my kids, but due to sensory integration therapy and just their maturing and knowing what to do, things are better. <br /> <br />Headphones /ear plugs have not been the answer for my kids, but are successful for others. Depends on the child. Made my son more sensitive because he would focus on it and listen to every little noise. Each child is different. <br /> <br />Other than pragmatic and social skills, sensory integration has been one of the major issues for my kids. So, I totally understand what you are going through! <br /> <br />Oh, you might also want to try one of the listening programs. Therapeutic Listening can be done at home (as we do), or at school too. <br /> <br />- <br /> <br />mom to 9 year old boy/girl twins (Asperger\'s/PDD_NOS) <br /> <br /> <br />'

'Interesting that you are discussing placement without mentioning goals. My school district does that sort of thing when it has a placement in mind and does not care to discuss goals that cannot be met in the placement in question.<br><br>I believe that the way around it is to get the present level of performance, and then get goals. You might need an outside evaluation for this if the district strong arms the school evaluators into only providing goals that point at its preferred placement. We see that. Then see where the goals can be realistically worked on. After that, you (or your outside evaluator) will need to tour the proposed placements and see how things work at the placements. Remember to ask at the end of the tour if what you saw was typical. I am handled during tours by high level special ed managers, and that puts everyone on their toes, including the teachers. The teachers behave noticeably different when they are under that level of attention.<br><br>All of this will suggest that you are pretending to know something about special education, and are being disrespectful of the experience and wisdom of the special ed staff who can diagnose and find the best placement for your child after a few minute interview and review of records <img src=\"smileys/smiley2.gif\" border=\"0\">. So you are likely to meet with some resistance <img src=\"smileys/smiley18.gif\" border=\"0\"> but it is your right to do so to participate as an equal member of the IEP team. <img src=\"smileys/smiley35.gif\" border=\"0\"><br><br>But to get to your question the \"appropriate\" placement is the \"least restrictive environment\" where the student receives educational benefit selected from a \"continuum of placements\". And if you believe that I\'ll sell you a bridge. From a practical standpoint, I get a couple of choices - if that - and I select the one that does not make me want to throw up. I also ask around and see what other parents are getting to see what is really available. Having a social group of local parents is good for that.<br><br>Best of Luck to you<br><br> <span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Dad2Luke&Alan on May 27 2009 at 9:20am</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it - U Sinclair  We choose to go to the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard - JFK</div>'

'Mamabear, <br /> <br />My suggestion to you would be to request an earlier meeting time for the <br />next meeting. Of course, if they asked for that specific time, it might have <br />been because of various committee members schedules (OT, PT, etc. if <br />they were attending). In my experience, teachers and other service <br />providers do not like when meetings are after school because of the exact <br />reason you listed. We want the parent to feel comfortable asking <br />questions and getting the information they need, but at the same time, <br />some people have been at work since 6:00 or 7:00 AM. <br /> <br />Also, if you\'re ever feeling pressured, or tired, you can ask to table the <br />meeting and continue it at another date and time. <br /> <br />Did the teacher or ARD facilitator give you a copy of your Texas State <br />Procedural Safeguards? (I\'m assuming you\'re in TX because I haven\'t <br />heard of ARD being used in any other state.. correct me if I\'m wrong, <br />though). <br /> <br />I would call up the district or whoever your contact person is and let them <br />know that you are in disagreement with the IEP and you\'d like to call <br />another meeting. In most cases, they have 10 days to do this (from the <br />day you contact them or they receive your letter). This is an excerpt from <br />the procedural safeguards: <br /> <br /><strong>&#9830; Disagreements about the IEP&#151;If you disagree with the school about <br />the IEP, the school must offer to recess the ARD committee meeting for <br />no more than 10 school days. This recess gives you and the school time <br />to gather more information that will help you reach agreement. If you and <br />the school still cannot agree, the school must implement the IEP that it <br />determines appropriate for your child. The school must give you prior <br />written notice that this is what will happen. The reasons for your <br />disagreement must be stated in the IEP. You may write your own <br />statement about the disagreement, if you choose. <br />If you cannot reach agreement, you may request mediation, file a <br />complaint, or ask for a due process hearing.</strong> <br /> <br />You can access the entire Procedural Safeguards by clicking this: <br /><a href=\"http://www.tea.state.tx.us/special.ed/explansaf/\" target=\"_blank\">procedural <br />safeguards, tx</a> <br /> <br /> <br />It is completely okay to have concerns about your child\'s placement. The <br />second ARD meeting that you call will hopefully resolve those concerns or <br />come to an agreement to place her where everyone agrees is best for her. <br />In most cases, school districts DO try to do what they think is best for the <br />child, despite what many people may think. Do not feel sick about it. I <br />honestly think there won\'t be any hurdles to jump and you\'ll likely feel <br />better once you talk to someone who understands what your concerns <br />are. <br /> <br />Good luck.<div class=\'post_sig\'>-   \"We should not strive to change the child with autism to fit the learning environment; rather we need to change the learning environment to fit the learning characteristics of the child.\" (TEACCH)</div>'

'<P>Hi I am new and my daughter (who is 3) was just diagnosed with PDD autism. We just got her assesed from the district and have an app for an IEP next month. </P> <P>The Psyc mentioned that she probably will be going to a preschool type program 5 days a week for 5 hours a day! This is bitter sweet to me because I am happy she is getting intervention, but I don\'t know if this is normal or accessive? I want her to have a lot of therapy but am afriad throwing her into this with 5 days a week will make her shut down.</P> <P>I would even like to do 3 days a week for 5 hours then maybe if she needs more increase it. Does the parents have a say in how many days she goes to preschool or do the professionals have the last say? Someone told me the teachers tell parents they have a say in the IEP\'s, but when it comes down to it we don\'t. Is this true? Will I be able to negotiate how many days she goes to school?</P> <P>Any advice would be helpful for a newie like myself. Thanks.<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"></P>'

'Yes I agree with Tzoya, Does your school have people trained in ASD\'s that do observations to make out a Behavior plan\'s? They wanted to put my child in ED class, at a different school, I asked them if this is where all the ASD children are schooled. It helped put an end to the ED talk. You need to ask for an IEE, in Writing. Also you are not having these problems at home I think that needs to be brought up. Your child is not ED, your child has Autism, there is a difference. I don\'t feel an ED class is appropriate placement for children on the spectrum. By the way Does your child have sensory issues that are being addressed at school? Does he get frequent breaks and rewards for good behavior? My son needed all of these things to function at school, it has made a huge difference. If you decide to do the ED placement, please observe the classroom first, I did and I would have home schooled my child before putting him in ED, in our district. I feel very strongly about this subject, it hits close to home. I also flooded the school with information about Asperger\'s syndrome, they did not like it, or me ,but to bad, cause they needed it. Your child needs an appropriate placement not an easy one. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- mom to 13 year old boy with aspergers</div>'

'If your homeschool has special ed department for the level of services he <br />needs (in other words if his IEP states that he does not require self- <br />contained) they will have to. I don\'t think most school districts would <br />agree to have services provided by outside schools. It is extra cost for <br />them and they will likely first see if the homeschool can swing it <br />somehow. <br /> My ds is mainstreamed and in my experience many general special ed <br />teachers do not really know how to provide social skills for asd kids. They <br />will maybe play candyand and call it something fancy for the paperwork. <br />I\'d say go to the school and ask the special ed teacher what curricilum <br />they are using. <br />If his current school is using something you feel works well ask them to <br />specify it in his IEP. When he is at his new school wait six weeks or so and <br />then ask the special ed teacher to see the data he/she is keeping on his <br />social skills goals. That\'s what I did and that is how I found out that even <br />thouh I kept being reassured that they \'knew what to do\' she had not <br />done a thing. I raised a big stink with the district and they had an asd <br />specialist come in and work on a program with the special ed teacher. It <br />helped the special ed teacher understand what ds needs and how to <br />implement it and my ds is now getting some social skills training. It is <br />still far from perfect but it is something I can build on. <br />all in all the bottom line is : you have to be involved. <br /> <br /><div class=\'post_sig\'>- micki, mom to three wonderful and wild kids.  ds 10 asperger & anxiety  twin dds 6 quirky but NT this far</div>'
'<P>Hi Everyone,</P> <P>My son is 5 and in kindergarten. He was in a 12kid with 2 teacher class that he could not handle at all. I had plenty of posts on here because every day from september -december was a nightmare. In january he started at a new school with 6 kids 1 teacher and 3 para\'s. He did great in febuary and then I dont know what happened. He is very stressful again. I thought maybe because he is not challenged or really learning anything new. The previous school he was at grade level . This class he is in now is to focus on behavior and not academics. He is doing all kinds of terrible behavior again and I just dont know what to think. I would consider medicine but I thought I might wait for the new school in september and classroom and see what happens. I dread getting him from school because they complain to me just about everyday but dont offer any solutions. They put him on a checklist to ease transitions but that cant fix the other issues. His Iep is coming up and I am doubting what classroom setting he should be in. I would like a self contained class at a community school with a para. But of course they might tell me he cant handle the 6 kids ..... I am so sad and confused. Just the thought of another school . It is hard for me too.</P> <P>Sharmyn</P>'
'<P> </P> <P>Loki,</P> <P>he does have an aide at lunch. His IEP is written that he must always be accompanied by an adult, and never be left alone.</P> <P>They normally cut up his food in very small pieces at school, and not give him more until he\'s done. I\'m assuming they were like me, and gave him a slice of apple, and let him eat it himself. It was peeled, since he will choke on the skin. He grabbed an apple slice at home this morning, and did fine.</P> <P>Since part of it\'s sensory I will talk to the OT. Sorry to hear you\'ve made no headway with the same issues, looks like I need to pay more attention.</P> <P> </P>'
'It is not something that CAN\'T be done at the same time as ABA, but if you are using discrete trial, that takes up LOTS of time. Frankly, I think RDI is best for parents to implement.

'<P>The school does not need to see medical information. The team will need to determine that your son has educational needs due to ASD in order to change the \"label\" under which he is currently receiving services, to the new label. That means he will need to meet educational criteria for the new label. A doctor\'s diagnosis does not provide this. However, it can make it a much easier process for the team to do, and it sounds like it should be a fairly simple straightforward process for your son because he has been receiving services already. </P> <P>It sounds like you have already discussed the diagnosis with your son\'s case manager.

'<P>You can certainly call an IEP meeting to discuss immediate issues like this, but the placement is going to have to wait until the testing is in, most likely. I forget what testing you\'re waiting for. Why not keep the IEP meeting appt. and address immediate issues that can be dealt with in the current placement. The truth is, I don\'t think that anything you can do this late in the school year will help your son pass if he\'s not already pretty close to passing.

'I understand your concern with getting services in place - and I am sure <br />the district wants to be certain this will be taken care of as well. However, <br />it\'s Summer! Teachers and other certified staff for public school districts <br />have the Summer off and thank goodness for that! They are able to <br />recharge and get all of their necessary energy and mental power ready for <br />the school year. I guarantee you that you could fight until you get an IEP <br />meeting, but it would not be a very good IEP meeting because they would <br />either have professionals in the room that wouldn\'t have contact with <br />your son, or you\'d have professionals in the room that were required to <br />come into the school on their Summer days off! I would talk to the Special <br />Ed department and see when you\'ll be able to get in touch with the <br />teachers and specialists who will be working with your son, and ask that <br />a meeting be scheduled prior to school starting. If it\'s the week before, <br />it\'s the week before. It IS the responsibility of the school district to <br />uphold his previous IEP unless another one is put in place of it. In our <br />district, if a child comes in and there is a para/aide requirement in the <br />IEP, we hire a substitute para/aide until the position is filled. It\'s really <br />just one signature on a piece of paper from the superintendent and it\'s <br />taken care of until the position fills. Also, a lot of schools have \"floating <br />aides\" that fill in where needed. It\'s possible that they may use this type <br />of person with your child until they figure out what\'s best for him. I would <br />imagine that you\'d want them to know your child, be aware of his needs, <br />etc. and find someone who will fill the shoes of being his 1:1 para in a <br />good way. <br /> <br />Continue to advocate for your son and know that the school district <br />probably does not want a lawsuit and WILL meet the needs of your son. <br />Also, keep a paper trail showing that you\'ve requested IEP meetings, told <br />them about the aide, etc. I\'d even write a letter (if you haven\'t already) <br />stating that you\'d like an IEP meeting as soon as the teaching staff and <br />support staff are available (when they begin school) and that you want <br />them to be sure to be aware of the fact that your child\'s IEP states that he <br />needs a 1:1 aide.

'<P>HOLY CRAP NELLE!</P> <P>I am so sorry for all of this . I don\'t even know where to start but here\'s a shot.</P> <P>1. The school cannot refuse to service your child because he is not medicated ( stated in IDEA 2004) amd the fact that they called social services is horrifying, it\'s a waste of money, abuse of the system and borders on harrassment and intimidation.</P> <P>2. Although it is my firm belief that everyone should move from Ohio, Is this teacher really pressing charges because your child got into an altercation with another student? Could you contact his case manager? this sounds like harrassment. They are refusing to educate your child and trying to take the easy way out. </P> <P>3. In no way would I send him back to school, I would call his pediatrician first thing in the morning, followed by a call to the DOE to file an official complaint and insist an investigation on this matter, It is evident that you are doing everything humanly possible to get the help he needs. Following that I would notify the school that you filed a complaint and you want to call a meeting regarding his placement, obviously they aren\'t capable of meeting his needs and needs to be transferred to a program that can (if it\'s 3 hrs away, so be it).</P> <P>I can\'t fathom a teacher pressing charges on a child. It sounds to me as if he\'s pressing charges stating he was verbally abusive. He\'s already dxed as being ODD, what more can they expect from him without offering the proper therapies. I would put all your ducks in a row, bring in all the evals, the reports from drs about the different meds he\'s been on and definately contact an atty. </P> <P>I\'m so sorry for all of this. If you need anything, let me know.</P> <P>Eileen </P>'

Since so many others have not worked you have built a great case to use ABA more frequently if that is working. Have you agreed to the IEP although they refuse to give you what you want ? You can always sign the IEP and implement it with \'exception\' and that exception could be that you want X amount of ABA and they are refusing to give you this..which sets the tone for Due Process and allows mediation to occur quickly.

Each state is allowed to create requirements, certifications and licenses for any type of specialty - or not. You must check with YOUR state\'s rules. For example, in NY, there are NO official requirements for an autism consultant. Since most of the reason why an autism consultant is brought into a classroom has to do with undesirable behaviors, most autism consultants around here are BCBA\'s. However, there is no requirement that they have to be. Just an example.

You get the book plus a PDF of it for $19.95. IDEA 2004 is then annotated by Pete Wright, which makes the book more valuable than simply trying to download IDEA 2004 from the Internet. I was required, as , and it took more than a whole ink cartridge! Printing things off the Internet is not always a bargain. Also, if you don\'t have a copy of your own state\'s regs, get one.

'<P>If the thing that is currently keeping him out of the mainstream is his behavior, as for a functional behavioral assessment and a behavior intervention plan. Ask that his behavioral progress be monitored on a regular basis. IF the BIP is not working, there should be a pow wow among the professionals about why it\'s not working and adjustments to the BIP need to be made and implemented. Just as you would expect your child to make steady progress in reading, you ought to expect that he will make steady progress in behavior. It is the school\'s responsibility to see that he does. Behavioral issues are often at the root of why an ASD child cannot get into the mainstream. Of course, the longer he is in a self-contained class, the more likelihood that his academic progress will suffer simply because he is out of the mainstream, so getting him to improve, behaviorally, as soon as possible, is key to his not getting so behind that mainstreaming become problematic even if his behavior DOES improve. Yes, the schools are supposed to have ALL kids meet state standards. But the truth is that that happens less in self-contained classes. For kids with NO cognitive issues, they get \"behinder and behinder\" (in my experience). For kids who do have learning disabilities or other cognitive issues, self-contained classes (with the greater attention and less distraction) may be the ONLY way to make academic progress, so those kids really benefit (they would most likely do even worse, academically, in a mainstream class). </P> <P>Of course, changing behavior is the HARDEST thing to do. Autism is a true disability. It\'s not our kids\' choice to behave outside social norms. It\'s the way their brains work. It can take many years to help them change the way they naturally do things, so getting your child\'s behavior to the point that he can \"make it\" in a mainstream classroom is not all that easy. However, the goal is always to get any child into the least restrictive environment in which he can learn, so keep that in mind each year at his Annual Review and make the District explain to you what they are doing to help him in your goal of getting him mainstreamed.</P>'

'<P>When you make a mistake doing... anything... say something like, \"Oh wow, I feel really frustrated that I made a mistake, but I know I can try it again/I will do it over/I don\'t need to get upset.\" Teach him the language so that he doesn\'t have to use his behavior to convey his frustration with myself. Even the highest functioning people on the spectrum struggle to label their emotions appropriately, and modeling is key.</P> <P>Also, letter and number reversals aren\'t uncommon at that age.

'<br />Not all OTs (whether public or private) are trained in sensory integration. So, it sounds like the school OT is one that is not. Perhaps there is another OT within the district that is trained that can help. <br /> <br />If your school is open-minded and willing to work with the private OT, that might be an option. Perhaps the school can document what happens prior to certain behaviors. Of course this is dependent on whether they are willing to work together with the private OT or not. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, districts (and even schools within districts)vary as to whether they believe that behavior can be improved with sensory diets. <br /> <br />Good luck. <br /> <br />- <br /> <br />mom to 10 year old boy/girl twins (Asperger\'s/PDD-NOS) <br />'
'<P>Hi there: School-based OT services can be difficult to obtain because we mainly focus on the education of the child and how he functions as a student in the school and his/her classroom setting. The best thing for any parent to do is to get written home programs from their current OT for follow-through and carryover at home as well as providing teachers with any helpful tips to enhance your child\'s educational performance (i.e. attention, self-regulatory interventions, etc.).

As for billing they were great since they would be inventive on his billing and get 12 weeks pre-approved at a time so that we would only have to fight with insurance 4 times per year. ST was the hardest to get approved as you all know the word autism send\'s insurance companies running for the hills. Zach has very mild CP also so we used this to our advantage that and he had a brain bleed at 2 mo. old that caused him to be hosptialized and we used that too for billing to get the services and therapies we needed. At 3 yrs. old he contracted Mono. and we used that for another 12 weeks of therapy since he had regression issues. </P> <P>As for schools in MI we only recieved the minimum. 1/2 hr. ST, 1/2 OT, and NO PT that was all I could get him. It\'s no wonder parents are out there paying out the nose for their kids. </P> <P>When we moved to AL we were floored when the school OFFERED 2 hrs. of ST per week, 2 hrs. of OT per week 1 hr. one on one, and 1 hr. social where she helps him play and interact with other kids. 1 hr. of PT for his ankles and hands (CP). Handicapped bussing door to door, and when I say door I mean it. They pull up in my driveway and all the way to the sidewalk by the front door! He doesn\'t have to walk to the road now!!!!

'<P>Nupur - <BR>We went through the same dilemma. In preschool though, it was a mixed group of levels, and Riley did fine. More importantly than anything, it was getting him used to the \"process of education\", getting used to other kids, etc. I think that the preschool level is a great segway into education, and offers more in the way of social skills than anything I\'ve seen yet through the primary school.<BR><BR>I think we\'d all like for our kids to be included with the regular classrooms, and I certainly think it\'s possible, depending on the child, the teacher, and the modifications. For Kindergarten, 1st and 2nd, Riley was mainstreamed. It wasn\'t until a really horrible 2nd grade that they finally gave in to my requests for a smaller class (I had orig. asked for 1:1, but they wouldn\'t provide it). The tough thing was being able to follow along at the same pace as others, the lack of [constant] feedback from the teacher, the noise, the crowd, etc. When the processing of information is slower than everyone else, they need those extra pushes, the extra explanations, visual schedules maybe, and to expect that they\'ll get that from a large class was unrealistic in our case. We had great teachers, but there is only so much they can do.<BR><BR>This year, Riley is in Special Ed, 4 students, 1 teacher, 1 aide. He is mainstreamed for Math (next year will be for science as well). He has had his most successful year to date. Part of that is that the teacher works closely with the special ed teacher and incorporates what she can in her class...she has modified her programs (for the whole class) to offer the support he needs, without making it look like he\'s the only one, or that it\'s been done for him. <BR><BR>She will be his teacher in 4th grade as well, which is why I agreed to another class with her, she understands what he needs and will incorporate those same philosophies for Science. <BR><BR>Other subjects, reading, comprehension, writing/language arts: He really needs more one on one instruction, and will stay in the smaller class. </P> <P>I care less about him fitting in than I do him being able to get all he can without feeling frustrated, stupid and the like...it was a tough decision, again, sure we\'d prefer not to have him in special ed, but it was a blessing nonetheless.</P> <P>I wish you the very best, I\'m sure whatever you decide will be fine and the best for Sayan!

And while you\'re at it, get an FBA done so that a good BIP can be added to the IEP, too. And ask what training the \"shadow\" has. Aides not trained in ASD can be more of a problem than a help. Let us know how it goes.'

'My 4th grader (Asperger\'s/PDD/NOS, depending on the wind) gets social thinking from MGW outside of school, I think that you are spot on about trying to get it into the school.

(with a 504 plan, if the teacher is in a good mood she might follow some of what we can suggest.)<br><br>In our case I think that this is due to equal doses of \"Not Invented Here\", fear over cost, and \"If you get it then everyone will want one\". I have noticed that everyone with similar services in this district has gotten them through the courts and all who are brave enough to talk to me have spoken of gag orders in the settlement.<br><br>We are currently trying donating the books to the school and his teacher. The center is currently working on books in comic book format and we are trying to see if the books are an easy enough read that the teachers will want to learn more.

'<P>THere are good things and bad about NCLB. My son is 17 and the truth is that special education BEFORE NCLB was way worse. Our kids were NEVER tested except during triennials, which meant YEARS could go be with no gauge of progress AT ALL. ANd how do you recover three years of no progress once that has happened. NCLB is about keeping the school district\'s feet to the fire and NOT allowing kids to slip on by for 13 years. It\'s a measure of the SCHOOL\'s progress. No wonder teachers don\'t like it.</P> <P>That said, there are also GOOD reasons not to like it. For one thing, teaching to the test. For another thing, there are no minimum requirements for the state wide testing, so some states have really EASY state-wide testing and some have harder. But, where the rubber meets the road (the classroom) I\'ve seen much improvement in spec. ed. since NCLB. And I was a skeptic. Still, I wish there were a way in NY to get a HS diploma WITHOUT studying courses that are college prep. Having to pass Regents (the RCTs die in 2013 and they are already a joke since the kids have to sit thru the Regents, fail and then take the RCTs) has actually LOWERED REgents standards for higher functioning kids while not giving the more impaired kids what they NEED.

The 1st school function that I ever attended during the school day was a Thanksgiving luncheon which was held for the kids and their families. It was so hard. As soon as I got there Quinn started crying and said \"I don\'t want to stay...I want to go home NOW!!! I just wanted to crawl under the table......we did end up staying even though he kept protesting for atleast a 1/2 hour...... School functions were hard for about the first 2 years of him being in school but then it gradually got easier for both of us, little by little. Now I am able to go to school events without any problem. I\'m even able to volunteer in the school library every other friday morning when his class is in there, this is something I have wanted for to do for a long time but never imnagined I would be able to do so without it being stressful for me and hard for him. Sometimes I still have to remind him to stay with his class, but we are both able to enjoy me being there. <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"> In our case it just took time......<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"> </P> <P>Does Matthew know that you will be at his Halloween Parade?....sometimes preparing Quinn ahead of time helped....

'<P>At this point, school isn\'t an issue. For some reason, he definitely gets that the teacher is in charge. He has never questioned her. He HAS however questioned the OT. So, she just came down on him hard (not in a mean way - I was totally fine with what she said) and ever since, she hasn\'t had one problem with him. His previous OT tried to coax and cajole and that just didn\'t work. OT is hard for him, so he is going to try to avoid it - period. But, once someone laid down the law - he was fine and has cooperated with minimal to no complaints ever since!</P> <P>We do a LOT of saying, \"Who\'s in charge?\" 99% of the time he will answer \"you.\" And then we explain what that means. </P> <P>But, I\'m a parent who believes in admitting when she is wrong and I have been wrong lots of times. Sometimes I jump the gun and I really need to do more listening to what the kids are saying rather than making my own assumptions. But sometimes, there just isn\'t time to do that! And so I will go back and tell him that I over-reacted and I\'m sorry. But, I also think that makes him think he can just argue more and more - and I end up getting more back-talk (which probably is another topic, but maybe not).</P> <P>I haven\'t tried really getting into the gray areas as of yet - I agree that is too much for him to understand. But, what do I do in situations where they are questioning me and they have a good point? Do I discipline them for questioning me (my gut instinct says no) - but then they don\'t differentiate between when it is okay to question and when it isn\'t - which I know is confusing for them!</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS (9 yo) diagnosed with mild PDD-NOS and DD (6 yo) NT - but definitely a challenge!</div>'

Johnson, M.Ed., M.D., FAAP, <br />Marshalynn Yeargin-Allsopp, M.D., FAAP, <br />and Philip R. Ziring, M.D., FAAP <br /> <br />\"My son Alexander is 11 years old. It was not until he was about 4 years old that I ceased thinking that he was \'just like me\' ? bull-headed and slow-to-speak as a toddler, disruptive and inconsiderate in grade school ? and accepted his diagnosis ... .\" <br />Clarence Schutt, a Princeton professor and father <br />of a child with autism <br />(from NAARRATIVE, newsletter of the National Alliance for Autism Research, 1997) <br /> <br />Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a collection of neurologically based developmental disorders characterized by impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and nonverbal communication, and abnormal, restricted, stereotyped behaviors. <br /> <br />ASD is the umbrella term for several conditions that have deficits in social skills as their hallmark. The term generally refers to autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder ? not otherwise specified (atypical autism) and Asperger syndrome. <br /> <br />For most children, the cause of autism is not known; however, a biological basis for the disorder is now well-accepted. A meeting of experts convened by the National Institutes of Health (1995) concluded that autism is indeed a genetic condition (Bristol, Volkmar, 1996). Yet the lack of a clearly defined mechanism to explain autism has led to many theories of causation. <br /> <br />While it is now well-accepted that autism has strong genetic underpinnings, there is recent evidence that environmental factors also may play a role, as demonstrated best by the increased frequency of autistic behaviors in children of mothers who ingested thalidomide during pregnancy. <br /> <br />Diagnosing a child with ASD presents the pediatrician with a challenging task since there is no biological marker. Instead, diagnosis must be based on the presence or absence of a constellation of symptoms and behaviors consistent with DSM-IV criteria. Judgment regarding the presence or absence of these behaviors is somewhat subjective and depends on the clinician\'s training and experience with ASD. <br /> <br />By definition, the onset of symptoms must occur before the third birthday. Even more challenging is disentangling the \"age of onset\" from the \"age of recognition\" (Volkmar, et al., 1985). Although most children later diagnosed as ASD present during the second year, a careful history often will reveal onset of some autistic features within the first year of life. <br /> <br />In fact, retrospective studies of home videos of infants have revealed that 8- to 12-month-olds with autism could be distinguished from normal infants by deficits in four areas: decreased eye contact, orienting to name, pointing and showing (Baranek, 1999; Osterling and Dawson, 1994; Mars, Mauk and Dowrick, 1998). <br /> <br />In about one-fourth of cases, parents report that development was normal until age 15 months to 24 months, after which the child lost previously acquired speech, withdrew socially and became indifferent to his/her surroundings (Tuchman and Rapin, 1997). <br /> <br />Autism characterized by such regression during the second year of life when children typically receive immunizations, particularly the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR), has led recently to concern about a possible link between the vaccine and ASD. In addition, there have been questions related to whether routine childhood immunizations can be at least partly responsible for what is now thought to be a higher prevalence of autism than previously reported in the scientific literature. <br /> <br />One of the major reasons used to point to a possible causal relationship is the recent increase in the number of required vaccines for young children. However, as noted above, the timing of administration of most of these vaccines coincides with the pattern of onset of behaviors typically seen in autism. <br /> <br />Concern about a possible link between autism and childhood immunizations is the most controversial and contentious of the many autism issues facing parents, physicians, researchers and the general public. If indeed there could be a link between autism and vaccinations, we must not hesitate to find out; as physicians, we all practice by the motto, \"Primum non nocere.\" <br /> <br />Attention to the autism/MMR vaccine controversy initially was generated by a 1998 Lancet article by Andrew Wakefield, M.D., describing a case series of 12 children with autism or other developmental disabilities who had been referred to the author\'s gastroenterology clinic because of chronic bowel problems. Eight of the 12 children were described by their parents as having onset of autistic behaviors after receiving MMR vaccine. <br /> <br />An editorial that appeared in the same issue pointed out major limitations in drawing causal inferences from the case series, i.e., small number of cases, biased case ascertainment, lack of a control group, autistic behaviors preceded the bowel symptoms in most cases and lack of a clear case definition. <br /> <br />To date, there is no convincing evidence that any vaccine can cause autism or any kind of behavioral disorder. The current biologic and epidemiologic evidence indicates that vaccines (including MMR) are not likely to be causally related to development of autism. Additional research is in progress specifically to evaluate the association between vaccines and autism in a U.S. population. Other relevant research also is well under way that may yield clues to underlying etiology, such as genetics, immunology and language and communication characteristics. <br /> <br />In the meantime, screening young infants and early referral of those considered at risk for this condition is extremely important. It has been found that parents\' concerns are reliable indicators that a problem exists (Glascoe, 1997). Pediatricians are strongly advised to listen to the parents, value their concerns and take appropriate action, which includes, but is not limited to, prompt referral to: <br /> <br />a specialist who is knowledgeable about ASD, <br /> <br />an audiologist for a hearing evaluation, and <br /> <br />an early intervention program. <br /> <br />Realizing that some parents may be unaware of their infant\'s or child\'s developmental delays and atypical behavior, it is critical that clinicians maintain a high index of suspicion during developmental surveillance at every well-child encounter, especially prior to age 12 months or shortly thereafter, in order to make the diagnosis as early as possible. Recent evidence shows that early and intensive behavioral and educational intervention can make a significant positive impact on long-term ASD outcomes (McEachin, 1993; Dawson and Osterling, 1997; Greenspan, 1997; Rogers, 1996; Smith, 1997 and 1998).

'<P>We moved to WV and I have been quoted the same thing that we could not observe my daughter in the classroom, because of privacy issues. I have requested several time(s) for the school there policy and finally was given a policy from the WV Board of Education that related to maintaining records. I would go to the wrightslaw website and basically request the school board policy that prohibits parents from observation. I am hoping they will respond, since my daughter will be going more time. I had no issues with observing in other states, but our recent move we have no right to observe our child. </P> <P> </P>'
'<P><FONT size=2>If you can afford the extra tuition for your kids, I would say go that route. Here is why. If the school district thinks this is the most least restrictive setting vs. being in a self contained classroom, then your son more than likely needs more socially and academically than he would get in the self contained classroom. Before you make a decesion, I would observe both placements so that you can see what each enviornment is like. The self contained class might have much more low functioning kids in it and might defeat the purpose. I once had a classroom that was self contained and only a small number of those kids were verbal. Therefore, they only had a few to interact with and no typical peers at all. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>I am a little like Andrew\'s Mom in not quite understanding how they can charge you for services offered in a public school, but I guess they can since they are doing it. Surely this is something that would be caught in state monitoring if it weren\'t the case. So I guess basically what you are saying is that what they offer school wise only happens the first part of the day. The second half of the day is not funded my the state or federal gov\'t and therefore the money has to come from somewhere. So parents pay to send there kids to that session. I have never heard of this kind of set up, but like I said, I guess it\'s legal. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>Before you make your decesion, just be sure to know what you are getting him into either way. The only way to know this is through observing those settings and get a look at what kinds of activities and programs are put into place. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>Also, I thought that you and I were in the same state but I might be wrong. Are your children in private school or public school. I was not aware that my state only required 1/2 day K. I know that in my state K is not mandatory, but usually when a child doesn\'t start school until 6, they end up going through the K program in the school because unless the K they did go to (like private church school) prepared them for 1st grade objectives in today\'s public school, they still need that year of K. But I had no idea only 1/2 day was mandatory. I have lived in this state all my life and been in many schools during both my degrees and in teaching and never heard of such. But the school couldn\'t away with something this large if it were wrong.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>One more thing, if they aren\'t offering anything but 1/2 day, then they aren\'t offering something that is individualized. Half day K might work for a NT kiddo, but what about your son\'s specific needs. If you can prove it that what they offer during that half day is not appropriate for his needs, you could get something else. But what I am not sure of. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>When you talk to your SE director, ask her about individualized programs. What do they do for kids with special needs who can\'t get those needs met in 1/2 a day but who are not low enough for the self contained classroom. Don\'t mention everything he is doing now or that you have to have him doing something for a full day. Go at it from the point of view of indivdualization and appropriate. The kicker is what is appropriate? I would think that if he is only at school for 3 to 3 1/2 hours a day and is receiving related services some of that time, when will he have time to meet all his objectives in other areas.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>Keep us informed. This is interesting. But I am afraid you have your work cut out for you with this one.</FONT></P>'
'Also, check with the state to see what they are doing to help parents advocate. They are required to do SOMETHING. Some states even provide free advocates to come to IEP meetings under some circumstances. Of course, you may have to wait for a free advocate. Around here, when you pay for an advocate, it\'s betweem $300 and $500 to come to the meeting.'
'<P>Ugh, we are paying too much. Honestly I do like our therapist and if she had been doing this for a while and already had her certification or some other qualification behind her I wouldn\'t have a problem with it. Well I\'d have SOME problem, it is expensive! <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley17.gif\" border=\"0\"></P> <P>For us it\'s just the behavior therapist and then the BCBA, there is no senior therapist working with us. Our BCBA developed the program (for a fee - I *think* $100/hour) and together they decide when to master something and move on to the next. Our therapist keeps track of data and sends graphs to me and the BCBA weekly. I don\'t get charged for that, I just get charged for actual time working with my daughter.</P> <P>Semi-included in the price is a 2 hour monthly meeting where we basically just go over everything and see how it\'s all going. We have to pay for her mileage here which turns out to be about $100. She has only supervised the therapist once and for that we had to pay her at her rate of $90/hour.</P> <P>What gets me is that before we started with this agency I talked to the BCBA about fees and she said the hourly fee could probably be reduced because of our therapist\'s small amount of training/experience. But when she came to our house to do the evaluation nothing was up for negotiation, it was $40/hour and that was that.</P> <P>Shelley - my therapist is very open with me and I know what she\'s getting paid and it\'s definitely less than half what we\'re paying for her!

'<P>That is great news. We invented our way of teaching DS math. My husband is a math whiz and LOVES numbers and manipulating numbers. He\'s the kind who does quadratic equations for fun when he\'s in the bathroom! He even loves doing simple arithmetic. I like math, too, and am VERY visual myself, so between us we figured this out. The dots work because they are visual. You can also try \"manipulatives.\" We used pennies because they are so accessible. OR buttons can work or bingo chips. We try to use a visual support for everything we do with DS. We started helping him at home because he had to be in a self-contained class in school since his language and maturity issues were so severe. However, the rest of the kids in the class were always somewhere in the retarded range (DS is not) so they did not pick up on many of the concepts DS found relatively easy. Many of the kids were still learning to count when DS was ready for multiplication (at about age 10). He had a one-on-one aide who was supposed to work on multiplication with him, but she didn\'t know how to multiply herself! Since about 2nd grade, we\'ve been working after school each day with DS to allow him to progress at HIS speed. He really could not be in any mainstreaming situations because he would get lost. The pace was too fast and his auditory processing issues really prevented him from following along. Although DS learns slowly, he has the capacity to learn beyond what his classmates could, so we allowed him to do that. At this point, he understands and can do simple geometry, eventhough he still talks like a preschooler. Wish we could have come up with a more effective way for his language to improve as much as his academics. I\'d be happy to have him speak on the 4th grade level, which is where he is, on average, academically.</P> <P>Good luck with your son.</P>'

At first he was having these huge meltdowns and I/we thought it might be because he was wearing himself out because of these...well last week and into this week, these meltdowns have been decreasing in size and intensity, but his naps seem to be increasing in time. We have a communication notebook and she wrote in there today that he slept from 10:30-1:30!!</P> <P>The director of autism for the school district came in yesterday and observed him for awhile and she is baffled as to why he needs these long naps. She saw some behaviors that she was able to help the teacher identify what was causing them, but yesterday while he was being observed, apparently he was working really well with his OT and just like that something set him off, he began to cry and scream, his OT offered him a break in the beanbag corner for 5 minutes...and she said he was asleep within a couple of minutes.</P> <P>Mason has so much going on with seizures, and mood problems...I\'m just not sure who I should be approaching about this. Do I call his neuro? Could there be something physically wrong with him and I should be calling his ped? Is this behavior related and I call his psych?</P> <P>I don\'t think it\'s seizure related...she isn\'t describing anything that would make me think that...he did start new meds last week, but this was going on before these meds were even started...I\'m just at a loss here!</P> <P>Anyone have any suggestions or advice for me about this?</P> <P>I really appriciate any thoughts at all, and thanks!!</P> <P>Oh P.S.

'<P>I would recommend telling him his accommodations... and telling him that you are in contact with his case manager. By telling him his accommodations, he can learn to advocate for himself, all while assuring that he is provided the accommodations. For extra time accommodations, tell him to ASK for extra time (not that he will be given it automatically). As a case manager, I tell my inclusion students to tell the general ed teacher- I need my test read to me; I need to use a calculator, etc. If you tell your son that you are in contact with the case manager, he will realize that the accommodations are being monitored and adjusted if he becomes over-dependent on them.

The kids do a really great job of redirecting him and they don\'t see the aide as someone who is just there for that one student.

'Bolting is common in young ASD kids. Ask for an FBA. The psychologist who does it needs to discover the FUNCTION of your child\'s bolting. Is it for attention? Is it task avoidance. Is it escape from sensory problems? Is it a lack of awareness of expectations? ONce the function of the behavior is discovered, and appropriate BIP can be put in place. This should be a KEY goal on her IEP - to stay in the classroom. Once the FBA is finished, hold an IEP meeting to review it and to adjust the IEP appropriately with a new goal.'

'I would SERIOUSLY read up on ABA. Lots of the bad opinions of it stem from old methods that have been done away with for YEARS. Also, sometimes people forget that ABA gives SKILLS to kids, but only going out into the big, bad world and USING those skills is going to give a child the full benefit. <U>Educating Children with Autism</U> is the best book, IMHO, for parents of young ASD kids. It is mostly ABA based and there is a lot written in the book about that. ABA is the ONLY method that has reliable statistical evidence that it works. That is because statistics is a PART of ABA (discreet trial) so there is endless information that shows each child\'s actual progress, day to day. Between 20 and 40 hours per week is what\'s usually recommended. If I had $20,000 to spend on my preschool ASD child, I\'d spend every penny on ABA and VB (Verbal Behavior, a language method that helps kids USE their developing language and is based on ABA).'

'<P>I did a small spiral notebook with Sarah but it was so sporadic and I got bored with the same tired responses so I stopped it, I so wanted her first year of kindergarten to be more open with teachers being grateful and actually wanting to help Sarah as a great opportunity for them as they have never had a child with autism. I also gave the teacher in the beginning a black folder containing about 15 pages of online free resources for teachers-free downloads &amp; information on ASD children(just a nice jester). I guess I was expecting too much..Sarah liking her teacher so much and actually wanting to go to school each morning is the only reason I don\'t yank her out and put her in private school! I do get a moment here and there when I pick her up ...but jeez! Not much info when you have cars behind you waiting for you to leave so they can go too. I requested small emails when she is not too busy just to ease my mind..I never got one or even a reply most times when I emailed her..usually wanting to know if Sarah is talking or interacting..I hate her school.

'<P>At the same rate, retention is a good thing for some kids. What kids learn in kindergarten are the building blocks for everything else. Even with an IEP and whatever supports are given to a child, they will still be exposed to the general curriculum. If by holding him back a year, he can actually gain something, you may want to consider it. Sending him to 1st may be over his head at this point.</P> <P>Retention should not matter in regards to an IEP. Request a full evaluation in writing and within 30 school days, you will have an IEP meeting. Testing is typically normed on age - not grade level, so whether your child is in kindy or 1st grade, it shouldn\'t matter. Good luck to you!</P> <P> </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to Dooder, age 6</div>'

'<P>It has been getting harder. Ds did fine in K without an IEP, struggled in 1st grade, got IEP and part time 1:1 for second grade, full time 1:1 in third grade and will likely go to asd program for 4th grade next year. If I re-read that :it is a depressing downward slide. And though his impairment stand out more clearly compared to peers he has made a lot of progress as well.</P> <P>I am not sure but there are a few reasons: Yes -a boy gets pegged more as a misbehaving boy instead of a cute spirited toddler, the \'cute factor\' clearly wears off after 1st grade. His peers are getting more independent and better at self-regulating and ds stands out. Teachers create class lessons that depend on those skills and ds can\'t keep up and stands further out.</P> <P>It also has not helped that with budget woes class sizes have been increasing and more time is spent on testing. Just one example: ten years ago only a few kids got ESy (extended school year) over the summer, the rest of the special needs kids were made part of summer school and there was enough staff to accomodate them. This year over 1000 kids get ESY. You could look at it that they get more specific services but I don\'t think that is necessarily true (I observed it) It is more that they get sorted out more to make the larger mainstream classes run smoother. Least restrictive environment has often little to do with the kids capabilities and much more with the district system needs. And once the teachers figure that there is a seperate program that \'those kids\' can be sent to, the more they are likely to push for that. At least in my experience.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- micki, mom to three wonderful and wild kids.  ds 10 asperger & anxiety  twin dds 6 quirky but NT this far</div>'

'I don\'t know if this will help, or it\'s something you\'ve tried, but: <br /> <br />I used to support a man with autism, who also had megacolon from years <br />of withholding. There\'ve been a few other people with megacolon I\'ve <br />supported over the years, including a woman with Rett Syndrome right <br />now, as it\'s a common problem in the developmentally disabled <br />population, but I think the first man I mention is probably the most <br />similar to your kiddo in this area. <br /> <br />Anyway, we had a \"bowel protocol\" for this gentleman. It included being <br />given lactulose every day (a prescription stool softener), fruitlax every <br />day, get up and go cookies regularly, and also being on a suppository <br />schedule. Every day 3 without a bowel movement (which was always the <br />case, he never went without the suppository), we would give him a plain <br />glycerin suppository. We would then run him a nice warm bubble bath, as <br />that was relaxing for him. He\'d then have a long soak in the tub, and <br />wind up, 90% of the time, having a BM in the tub. A bit messy, but easier <br />to clean than in his pants, and beat the heck out of having him impacted! <br /> <br />The other folks I\'ve supported with megacolon have also had prescribed <br />laxatives, either lactulose or Docusate Sodium (it\'s a capusle), along with <br />either an oral fleet or microlax if they hadn\'t gone within a certain <br />number of days. They all eat fruitlax and get up and go cookies. <br /> <br />My little foster son also withholds, and, I am pretty sure has a lazy bowel. <br />I\'m waiting on a nutritionist/dietician consult on his behalf, and for the <br />doctor to develop a bowel protocol. He\'s gotten impacted three times in <br />the last few weeks, and basically it\'s a constant monitoring o fhim to <br />make sure things are moving right now (he\'s not toilet trained at all). <br />What works for him is lots of fluids, orange juice, and plenty of oils. I just <br />made a pot of fruitlax tonight, to see if it helps. <br /> <br />FTR, fruitlax is super easy to make, and most kids/people like it. You <br />take equal parts prunes, raisins, and dates, just cover them with an acidic <br />juice (cranberry works nice, I used an orange/mango juice tonight). Cook <br />on med-high until it starts to break down. Keep adding juice to keep it <br />moist and from sticking, and turn it down to simmer. Keep simmering it <br />until it\'s turned into a goopy, mushy muck, lol. Like jam. Let it cool, and <br />stick it in the fridge. You can add cinnamon and/or cloves while you\'re <br />cooking it if you like. It stays good in the fridge for a couple weeks. A <br />few tablespoons a day keeps most people regular. It\'s healthy but high in <br />calories. <br /> <br />If you ever want some tips on healing the gut and addressing yeast <br />naturally, feel free to PM me - it\'s made a world of difference to my boys. <br /> <br />Best of luck with your little guy!<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Donny 13 - classic autism, bipolar</div>'

'<P>Hello Jdenzmom,</P> <P>If your son is autistic or aspbergers, One reason there is always difficulty with the poop in potty is to these children: This behavior that (we parents) are trying to get them to mastered is veiwed from the autistic child point of view as:</P> <P>This is part of my body and you want me to put it in there and than the potty makes this loud noise and takes part of my body away. I read an article last year and A teenager with autism explained that to the parent.</P> <P>My suggestion is 15 mintues timeout is too long. the rule of thumb for young NT children is 1 mintue per year of age. Example a 3 year would get a timeout for 3 mintues. Keep in mind you might want to go to maybe 4 or 5 mintues instead.</P> <P>The marriage separation could still be on his mind especially if your husband works late and your son does not see him much after your son gets out of school. Yes all children can sense when any parent or adult (they are close too) is stressed.</P> <P>If this is a power struggle, Then I am sorry to say It is up to us as parents to de escalute ourselves. Maybe your child is not receiving the signal that he has to poop until it is too late. My 3 year is recently having accidents (she is delayed) Yet still I have not gotten a formal diagnosis, but now I am wondering if she is not feeling the pressure of her pee until she has wet her pants. Her brother is Pdd and also he has mitochondria disorder. He is on many vitamins and supplements because his body needs extra so that his brain can process and learn. Example, He needs magnesuim so I am in the middle of researching to find GFCF Magnesuim. Becuase He has been without the extra magnesuim cuts, wounds and bruises take too long to heal. In the fall, My son all of a sudden was doing night wetting. The pysch doctor thougt it was behavioral well I was not connvinced so i spoke with my son\'s Developmental Pedtrician, IT turned out I was out of GABA (another supplement) My son takes. He did not have it for a couple months. as a result The bedwetting was because without that supplement, my child\'s neurological system could not keep him dry at night.</P> <P>I attended a workshop lastyear on potty training with special needs children, the main focus was positive reinforcement for task partial and/or fully completed. the workshop frown on using negative reinforcment. ThE main purpose was for the parent to have a consistent schedule and chart every time child went ,was result partial success, fully success, what was child doing before hand. Could you be too stressed about this Potty traing issue that in fact it is spilling over in your stragety? Are you using a potty seat ring? (It makes the hole in smaller, you know they are made with dora on them or other characters?</P> <P>Could it be sensory issue?</P> <P>I found my book, There is a book called Toilet training for individuals with autism and related disorders: a comprehensive guide for parents and Teachers by</P> <P>Maria Wheeler, M.Ed. </P> <P>see if you can get book from library or purchased it.

Remember you want to work with that <br />person and a lot of schools will not let you switch teachers and there is <br />no guaranty that the next teacher would be any better (could be a lot <br />worse actually). Be friendly! Write a nice letter reminding the teacher that <br />transitioning is one of Abby\'s IEP goals and that you are happy to <br />brainstorm with him and the resource room. <br />You have to remember that the average teacher will know very little about <br />autism and will not get much support on figuring things out from the <br />district either. He will have 10-20% special needs kids in his class and all <br />kids are going to be more or less a mess the first few weeks.

'Tzoya, wher was the school you had your son in. I was wondering if I could find a similar situation in our area. What kind of school was it and did you get it paid for.

'On Friday, I watched as my ASD student worked with one of my NT students on a math assignment. I was just getting ready to help S myself when A asked if she could help instead. I was delighted. She is a natural born teacher, I believe-so patient and encouraging. S was enjoying working with a classmate. So my NT student is the \"safe person\" for S to go to for help when I\'m not available. I modeled for him how to ask A for help and he practiced. I know he will need reminders but I am confident he will ask on his own very soon. I am so excited by the progress S is making with his social skills. The very same day I saw him doing chalk art on the playground with another one of my students. Thank you to all the parents here who have e-mailed words of encouragement and suggestions. I think of you as I am teaching everyday.'
'<P>My son was giving two doses of his dilantin. The second aide didnt check to see if it had already been pasted she just gave it to him. The first aide went and told the school nurse. And then cleared him for an outing. The first aide called me and let me know what was going on. I called my aunt. Her and I went to the superintendent of my sons school and the aide who had him she was told to take him to the hosptal. His levels were tested and we waited there until they got the results back in. they were in the toxic range. You could tell he was drugged and he looked high. He was trying to sleep in the er room. so they had him miss a few doses of his dilantin. by the time we got out of the hopital the school was closed. So I went there the next day and pick up his meds they will never give my child any meds not even ear drops!!!! </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- darcy</div>'
'<P>Shelley yes the teacher does know and i got a note even when my daughter started school about her needing to bring her lunch juice etc, but the teacher is so into getting her to drink the milk which isnt a bad idea but she has issues with constipation etc. Think the teacher excepts her needs but tries to get her to fit in and not let other kids see she has something different cause it really isnt always allowed anyway kids always have to buy their lunch in that school.

'<P>Screech - Speak to your advocate. Even No Child Left Behind REQUIRES that teachers be trained in the areas that they are teaching in. All teachers of spec. ed. preschoolers need to help with speech throughout the day, but there also needs to be a licensed speech therapist to give speech therapy. If AJ has not gotten that sort of therapy, they may owe you compensatory services. This will not stop until parents CALL them on it. So get back on the phone and talk to that advocate you had. And maybe try talking to other parents of kids in your son\'s class. There is strength in numbers.</P> <P>PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE THIS BOARD. If I were a moderator, I\'d start a whole new thread for you and those parents who feel the same way you do. Only for discussions regarding lower functioning or nonverbal kids. I KNOW how hard it is to watch other kids advance further than your own. But ALL of us, even the parents of high functioning aspies, go through this. It\'s just that THEIR kids are in mainstream classes and THEY have to compare them to NT kids. All of our hearts are raw. </P> <P>You also should consider that some people are just born optimists. They will say, \"He said cookie!<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley17.gif\" border=\"0\">\" WHereas other people will say \"All he says is cookie<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\">\"</P> <P>Take what you read here with a grain of salt. The ONLY person you can compare AJ to is AJ. He IS making progress. He will continue to make progress. Take videos of him but don\'t look at them for at least 6 months. A year is better. When you DO look at those tapes, you\'re going to be shocked at how much better off he is a year later. NO, the issues won\'t all have been resolved. But the truth is, FOR ALL ASD KIDS, NO MATTER HOW HIGH FUNCTIONING, our kids will never be NT. A very few will be able to pass for NT, but not the vast majority. I realize none of the parents of preschoolers want to hear this. And that\'s fine. Because we ALL should behave as though it will be OUR kid who wins the autism lottery and makes it. But we shouldn\'t believe that it is because we, as parents, haven\'t done enough if they don\'t. Ever single one of the parents on this site is trying DESPERATELY every single day to make things better for themselves and for their child.</P> <P>I have to tell you, Screech, I wouldn\'t have survived thus far if I hadn\'t gotten involved in several parent groups, including one at my house run by me. Get in touch with the Autism SOciety of AMerica, which is VERY active in CA. Ask about lectures and support groups you can attend. One of the best things you can do is make friends with a mother who has a Down Syndrome child. These kids tend to end up very verbal and very social and will do ANYTHING to drag their new autistic friend out of his shell. My DS used to have a Down\'s friend until she and her family moved. It was great. </P> <P>Stay here with us. We need you.</P>'

The curriculum was much stronger than other typical preschools and they follow state standards, which most private preschools do not. I think it is a great set-up.

'It\'s 60 days according to FEDERAL LAW. States can give more rights to parents, but not fewer. However, that is neither here nor there. THe CRITICAL thing is that the Districts have to start the time clock the day they get YOUR WRITTEN CONSENT TO EVALUATE. And then it\'s 60 CALENDAR DAYS, including all Sundays, Holidays, and summer. So, count the days from the day you wrote them a letter asking for the school-based evaluation IF it included the phrase \"please consider this my written consent to evaluate.\" Otherwise, start the clock from the day you filled out the District\'s official consent form.'

'Raquel, <br />My little guy is in a typical K with 17kids. He has an ABA therapist as his <br />aide. For the most part my son is doing very well. He however has had <br />intense ABA since he was 2.5yrs. My son has attention/impulsivity issues <br />as well. He is being trained for that however. We do it at home and he is <br />reinforced big time at school. One thing that his K teacher does is to go <br />over the classroom rules in a very positive way, there is lots of structure <br />and lots of things to do. There really is no time for my little guy to get <br />into trouble. Because he has typical peers around him and good models, <br />he has picked up some good habits and really enjoys his friends. <br />I would go to some different schools and really note If the teacher is <br />positively reinforcing the children. The rules and expectation should be <br />clearly defined. Before I had my asd child my take of good classrooms <br />were so different. I went by teacher reputation and what the cirriculum <br />looked like. I do understand your concern though. Your son is gifted and <br />so he should be in an academic classroom yet because of his behaviors he <br />can not attend in that setting. The SE classrooms in my SD would not be <br />be appropriate for your son or mine as the expectation is lower. If they <br />mainstream for part of the day, they are forever guests in that other class <br />and the mainstream teacher really is not completely vested. <br /> <br /><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to ds age 17/nt   dd age 14/nt   ds age 6/asd</div>'
'<P>While I was dealing with the issues I had with the district in Texas, my comments to the therapists were that since we were also utilizing outside services to fill in the gaps the district didn\'t provide, I didn\'t want anyone working at cross-purposes or duplicating efforts. I made sure that I kept the daily sheets regarding activities (including OT/ST/PT time) that the teacher simply circled to indicate what had occurred during his class time. I used one similar for what was going on at home to send to the teacher. I kept copies of all of them in a notebook in chronological order as well as copies of the dated communication book we used to send any extensive comments/requests/etc. The daily schedule sheets indicated when he was supposed to have been in ST/OT, and then I would email the therapist requesting that she forward me a copy of her session notes for the days the teacher showed him to be in therapy. I usually got it, and the routine worked well enough to the point that the therapists often sent it without prompting. If, for some reason, he didn\'t attend ST/OT that week, I would drop an email to find out why.</P> <P>Now that I\'m out of Texas and in a new state/district, I\'m still staying on top of it, but it has been much easier. The school personnel here already had similar practices in place and we had it put in his IEP as a matter of course. Daily work and a communication folder is regular as clockwork, and his therapists actually use a separate binder that comes home with him on therapy days with detailed notes and a place for me to comment or ask any questions. I make copies of it all before going back as a safeguard, although so far all the documentation stays in his binder until the end of the month each month and then is filed and a new month starts.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- COPAA Advocate Member,MPact Mentor, single parent to 4 ages 19 to 6, all with disabilities.

My mother in law is appaled by our school and everyone elses schools out of our town seem to be alot easier to deal with. The rest of the districts near us are actually not near us at all. My mother in law said I should write them a letter concerning them doing away with the seperate playground area for the kindergarteners.

I think they would tell me hes functioning and thats all that matters or something stupid like that anyway. blah. I did request OT eval but im going to submit a seperate letter asking for OT eval.

'<P>He can do it! He did need some prompting. It seems to be getting started that is the issue - then he can do it with no problem. </P> <P>He was able to create an AB pattern from scratch without prompting with the manipulatives (the ants!). The ABC pattern he needed prompting - but he had just switched two around and was able to see it when we said yellow, red, green, red, yellow, green - he then switched the red and yellow around to the right position without my prompting to! So, he CAN fix it!</P> <P>He was doing so well, we switched to paper. He needed more prompting here. So, we are just going to work on switching colors, not shapes as well. I had him write A, B, A, B, in alternating colors. This was a bit easier for him. He needed one prompt but then was able to continue for 6 more in the pattern.</P> <P>This is great! However I then got a dose of reality when my 3 y.o. dd started making AB patterns by herself with the ants when ds went upstairs. Without prompting and without my initiating it.

'<P>You may not need a book. And if you were able to advocate for appropriate work for your son when he was little, you can now, too. I do not mean that you, in particular, are complaining. But that many people on this board act as though there\'s nothing a parent can do. This very topic is called \"the school district gave up on my child.\" They CANNOT do that unless WE PARENTS LET THEM. And the way we let them is by not knowing enough about how to hold their feet to the fire. This book makes it easy. Of course, parents can find out the same information about how to FORCE the school to step up to the plate in other ways. It\'s just that this book has all the info in one place</P> <P>Standardized tests are the scale on which the success of an IEP is weighed. So it\'s imperative to get the schools to use individual, standardized testing yearly. It\'s important to understand what our kids\' scores actually mean. It\'s important to MAKE the schools get our kids to meet grade level standards. And doing this is not easy unless we know what the schools are required to do, we let them know that we know, we have the facts about how our kids are actually doing and we measure the SCHOOL by letting them know that we expect progress each year and intend to have it measured. If you or anyone else can do that without a book, that\'s fine. I certainly couldn\'t have. It\'s unfortunately true that I see plenty of complaining on this board about the school underestimating the child (witness the title of this thread) but that cannot happen if the school\'s success is constantly being measured by the child\'s actual progress and any lack of proress thrown back at them. I sure wish I had known enough to do that YEARLY as my son went through school. The fact is, though, that the laws have changed since my son was little and our kids have more academic rights now than they used to since NCLB applies to them, too. We parents have to enforce those rights so that NO SCHOOL EVER GIVES UP.</P>'

'I am always of the opinion \"If it isn\'t broke don\'t fix it\" Switching schools <br />is hard enough for a typical child, I can\'t even imagine how hard it would <br />be for your son especially after he has already started to make friends <br />there. <br /> <br />I didn\'t look at this school in particular but some private schools are <br />excellent and some lack the resources of public schools. As you <br />mentioned they typically don\'t have anyone who is specifically trained or <br />certified so when accommodations need to be made, it can be more <br />difficult for them. On the other hand some private schools are more <br />accepting of certain things, especially when a family wants to send in an <br />aide. <br /> <br />I would try to break it down objectively for your wife and list out the <br />benefits/disadvantages of your son\'s current school vs the private school. <br />Have her try to do the same and then choose the school that has the most <br />benefits.

'<P>Ginger makes an excellent point about getting your son educational therapy to help with his reading comprehension issues. I actually sued L.A. Unified School District over just this point.

'<P>fred,</P> <P>I think this varies from school to school. Our ASD teacher had an individual meeting with each \"specials\" teacher and informed them which of the kids in their class were on an autism IEP. All of ds\' teachers were surprised except for the computer lab teacher. This was about the 3rd week of school. I don\'t think the specials teachers get informed of the IEP/diagnosis unless a teacher takes it upon themselves to share that knowledge! I thought everyone would be informed, but apparently they are not. But, this ASD teacher really wanted the specials teachers to know for all her kids. She is awesome!</P> <P>Have you thought of getting Evie into adaptive Phy Ed? And if she\'s failing PE, would she qualify for PT? Probably not, but it might be worth it to ask! Poor kid - I know what it\'s like to be poorly coordinated.

'My son has PDD-NOS. He will be graduating at the end of the month. But what to do from there?! I found a school in Minnesota (Life Skills) and visited it. I really liked it, but the tuition is not affordable. I do have him signed up for Rehabilitation Services in IL. I\'ve read about so many Autism people who have went on to college and became a success. He doesn\'t want to go on to college. He was not diagnosed until the end of 8th grade, and had a horrible time in school. In 9th grade, he was in a small secluded class. He needs the structure and more one on one. I did find a college in Evanston that is for LD population. I guess it is on the Threshold program. I do not think this is a good fit. If he doesn\'t want to go on to college, and keep learning, I do not think I should make him do this. I think people like Temple Grandin had the desire to learn. He doesn\'t. There really isn\'t much out there for teens and adults.'
'<P>Hi, My son is PDD and has been receiving home ABA services for a couple years. He gets 10 hours of ABA at home now.</P> <P>The school is developing an ABA classroom next year (preschool). They are offering me 5 hours of ABA at home during the year and placement in an ABA classroom (25 hours a week). They said they can not tell me how many one on one ABA hours he will get at school. I have an evaluation that recommends about 15 hours of individualized DTT. I take that to mean, one-on-one DTT. I do not think I should an accept an IEP that does not specify the number of one-on-one hours he will get. </P> <P>I was hoping someone here might be in an ABA classroom and can share what they have on their IEP. I am especially interested in anyone that is from Mass and if so, what town. However, all advice would be appreciated. Thanks</P> <P> </P> <P>Susan</P> <P> </P>'

'It does sound like he is Autistic to me. The fact that he is responding to the program is great. My child with Autism is responding really well to the PLAY project. Autism doe not mean a child cannot improve or even be completely successful with the right help. It often did in the past, but only because they didn\'t know what the right help was. <br><br>Still, I\'m only going by a thread here and you are the expert on him. If you really don\'t think he has Autism, look up Sensory Processing Disorder and see if that sounds more accurate to you. Maybe that is the evaluation he should be getting. <br><br>Also before you go look up Wrights Law, the Federal Law about I.E.P.s to know exactly what they are responsible to do, no matter what. wrightslaw.com has all sorts of things about laws and winning I.E.P. hearings. The Letter to a Stranger is especially brilliant. They have experts guiding them through their documentation and how they say things to get what they want, you should too. <br><br>Bring lots of documentation. Keep a log of his issues, how much you\'ve been doing with him, and how it is working. I wouldn\'t bring a lawyer or advocate to this meeting though. It might just shut down any negotiations that could happen. However, I do suggest you bring the expert who works with him to give a professional opinion.<br><br>And no, him <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">seeing</span> someone else get OT is not like getting OT anymore than seeing another kid served lunch is like him getting something to eat. Geeze, I can\'t believe they even tried that crap. But I suspect you\'re right. It sounds like they are going to try not to give him O.T. Remember if your kid has any I.E.P. the state is sending them a check no matter if they are spending it to help him or not. <br><br>Also, be sure they send you the I.E.P. they are proposing ahead of time so you are not put on the spot. In almost all states they have to if you ask. If they balk, nicely say that you know it would be best for everyone if they you are able to work things out and sign at the meeting. You don\'t want things held back because you haven\'t had enough time to look something up.<br><br>Most importantly, DO NOT sign an I.E.P. you don\'t agree with - no matter how much pressure. An agreement to fix something later is not legally binding, but your signature on that paper is. <br><br>I hope you never need to know about this but...<br><br>If worse comes to worse and you do go to court, there is a government fund that any parent who sues their child\'s school district and wins can use to pay reasonable attourney fees. I found information on it searching parents.com for Autism. I think the article was called \"Don\'t Ignore My Son\" but I\'m not sure.

'This is a pretty straight forward question I think. My son went to public <br />PreK last year for SPED students. He is starting Kindy this year. Our last <br />IEP review meeting was in February. We didn\'t discuss Kindy goals at that <br />time, nor were they mentioned on the IEP. I asked about them and I was <br />told we would have another meeting to do the goals for kindy towards <br />the end of the year. I asked about it again in April and was told (by his <br />PreK teacher) that we wouldn\'t have the meeting until the next school <br />year started. I didn\'t really understand why and she told me we would <br />need to see how he did in Kindy before deciding on how to change the <br />IEP. I\'m thinking this is a bunch of crap. I know I would feel better for <br />him to have an IEP with kindy goals spelled out on them before school <br />started. We are going for his kindy testing today. Maybe they are waiting <br />to see how he does on that? I don\'t know. Are they required to do <br />modifications to the current IEP since those goals are applicable to PreK <br />curriculum and not Kindergarten? <br /> <br />Oh dear. What do I do? This is the first time I have felt clueless when it <br />comes to this.'

However, in order for students to participate appropriately. THEY MUST be taught first.

'<P> I just recieved more info and how they are getting away with this. They have changed the format of interims and grade cards. On the top of both forms they have added the word standard ex. interim standards report and standards report card. This will effect alot of children. The teachers give a couple standard assessment test during a grade period and if a child fails this test they will receive a F for that subject. Now keep in mind this child could be turning in all assignments and getting good grades but still receive a F. I did find out that they can not do this if your child is on an IEP but that is only for the subjects he or she qualifies in. Which still confuses me do to the fact that my son placed in eveything including reading and we all know you have to read in order to do social studies and science, But they mainstream the kids for these two subjects. So this means my child will have F\'s in these subjects no matter how his grades are, because they can not read this test to him. Yet they are to modifiy his work in these subjects because of his IEP. <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley7.gif\" border=\"0\"></P> <P> Tessa</P> <P> </P>'
'Once a request in writing has been submitted, the school has 60 school days to put the actual therapy in place. For preschool age, it may be different (30 days to get the testing, 30 days to implement) but the total must go no longer than 60 days. In NY, the school district must get back to the parents within 5 business days to tell them what\'s going on, but the OT called, so that might qualify. But the child needs to be getting the interventions by the 60th day - ALL of them.'

She informed me that although the school district has 7 procedural violations on my daughter\'s current IEP, there is nothing I can do. She basically told me that IDEA is an unenforceable law and there really is no recourse for parents that cannot afford thousands of dollars to go to due process. My own research into Fair Hearings Rulings in California has shown a discouraging trend in parents losing to school districts.

YOu may have <br />to teach him how to do something else (replacement behavior) <br /> <br />I have also been told that ABA and IBI are the same things over and over. <br />My question is this, why not call it ABA then? <br /> <br />Sorry to ramble.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to ds age 17/nt   dd age 14/nt   ds age 6/asd</div>'

'<P>OK, so a couple of weeks ago, I had a parent/teacher conference with J\'s preschool teacher. In that conversation, she informed me that the ECSE classroom was being disbanded and folded into a regular HeadStart program. Inclusive. Sounds great, doesn\'t it? <BR><BR>My problem is this: she handed me a packet of paperwork to fill out. A physical/dental examination form, and an application for HeadStart. The physical and dental forms don\'t especially bother me, though I was not asked to fill them out before he started sp.ed. pre-k last year. What bothers me is the HeadStart form. First and foremost, the questions are extremely personal in nature (I gather as a means to determine which children really need HeadStart, since there are so few spots that income guidelines are not enough), and second of all...just, why? Why do I need to fill out an application for HeadStart? He should be in special education period, he\'s already qualified due to his moderate/severe autism! She told me that he \"should\" get in. Excuse me? \"Should\"? That had better be \"will\"! My other option, it appears, is to go back to a home based program, which is, of course, the MOST restrictive environment, rather than the LEAST.<BR><BR><BR>The cherry on top is that his teacher will be reduced to a \"consulting\" capacity, and the classroom will be run by a regular teacher and some aides. Consult? Obviously, she might have to look for other work now, as it won\'t even come close to adding up to full-time employment for her, and I can\'t blame her. But a \"Consult\"? This teacher isn\'t trained to deal with special needs kids? AAAAHHHHHHHH!<BR><BR>A friend of mine called our local ARC this morning, and the advocate there knew NOTHING about this change! She said that the funding for all these pre-k programs is federal (not surprised), and she\'d check around to see what was what. I had an appointment with my son\'s psychiatrist this afternoon, and I mentioned this change to him, and he also knew nothing about this integration. I also told him what the teacher had said about the aide, and he recommended that I contact the National Alliance for Mentally Ill? He wasn\'t sure of the name, but he said they have a local chapter and they provide advocates as well, so I\'ll likely call them tomorrow afternoon. I\'m wearing out my google, trying to figure out what to do next.</P> <P><BR>I am just severely disappointed. This school system has been great so far, and now...you know, the teacher flat out told me that he \"wouldn\'t\" get an aide, that it\'s \"too expensive\", even though she herself has told me that he requires a lot of one on one help.<BR><BR>I am steaming mad...any advice???<!- / message -></P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Evie on March 12 2008 at 6:41pm</span>'

'<P>I believe the most common adaptive screening tool is the Vineland (formal name Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales).</P> <P>This is actually my \"favorite\" test (if one can have such a thing) because in each subcategory it gives you an age equivalent score. For example, when my son was 6, his age equivalent score in communication was 4.2. I could SEE that. My 6 year old did communicate like a 4 year old. I could SEE the 2 year gap when I spoke to him. Same with social skills. It wasn\'t just a meaningless number (though there is an overall adaptive number at the end). This test more than anything is the one that I look at hoping to see progress. We all hear our kids are \"delayed\" and \"behind\" but this is the one test that tells me where the gaps are and how big they are.</P> <P>I too agree that the adaptive scores are more predictive of success in life than the IQ scores. However whereas IQ scores tend to remain somewhat constant over the course of ones life adaptive scores can be greatly influenced by all the therapies we do, and maturity and a host of other things. We are living this. IQ is staying constant but adaptive scores are showing improvement each year when he\'s tested.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Kristy  Mom to 10 year old twin boys (1 PDD-NOS, 1 ADHD)</div>'

'<P>I guess the answer is it\'s busywork. Jamie can spell anything he\'s seen even once and gets 100% on virtually all spelling tests. I really don\'t know why a person needs to read a word backwards and diagonally. I KNOW why my son is being given tons of busywork. It\'s because he is academically WAY advanced for his class. Why is he IN this class? He\'s ALWAYS been in classes that are too academically easy for him because he\'s developmentally and speech-wise NOT at the head of those classes. For him, the environment of these quiet, small classes is key. He first got an aide in elementary school specifically because he had to be given way different work than the other kids. The ESY teacher this year (my son\'s first year in ESY) told me he needed to get to bed earlier because he kept putting his head down on the desk and sleeping. He was getting to bed at 9 and sleeping until 8! Then the teacher said, \"I guess it\'s because he\'s finished way before the others.\" DUH. Turns out the teacher was given NO materials and just brought from home the things he thought might be appropriate. His material WAS appropriate for the rest of the kids, but not for Jamie. I asked him if he wanted me to send in materials and he said \"yes.\" I was flabbergasted because most teachers would have faked that there was plenty available. ESY is taught by different teachers than during the school year and they don\'t know the kids at all. Of course, my son didn\'t complain. He LOVED doing easy work and napping. At the end of the summer, the 100 word search papers came home. And one of the first homeworks DURING the year this Sept. was that word search that took Jamie an hour. He does generally like those things, but he also gets frustrated because he wants to do EVERY one . I would have stopped it after 20 minutes (I think that is more than enough time spent on busywork) but he won\'t let me. </P> <P>BTW - We have NEVER gotten a word search that had anything to do with spelling words or reading words. They are just xeroxes of stuff the teachers have or have found. I understand that there are gaps in the day that have to be filled but my son would be happy to look up words in the dictionary and write out the definitions. At least then he\'d get practice in something useful. Grrrr....</P>'
'<P>Just a note on cross-cat. When my son was 3 he as non-verbal, and he was placed in a class with primarily ASD/non-verbal kids and it went very well.

In ours it was high functioning ASD, speech language and ADHD. This was a good group for my son.</P> <P> </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Kristy  Mom to 10 year old twin boys (1 PDD-NOS, 1 ADHD)</div>'
'Diane, if he receives special ed services he has until he is 21 to get his general ed diploma. Can\'t you spread everything out over a 4 year track so he can get all the necessary credits without totally overloading him? This would include summer school as well, of course. I hate the idea of academically overloading him, when clearly the school has yet to adequately assess his deficits so that they can properly educate him. He deserves the opportunity to earn a standard diploma, and then go to college if that is what he wants. The school has failed both him and you. Keep pushing for all the testing so you can get a proper evaluation and move forward with making an appropriate educational plan for him. Tell the school that you will not cooperate with making a plan until you get back all the test results. Don\'t let anyone pin you to the wall when you aren\'t working with all the information you need to make a decision.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Karen - Connor, 15, Asperger\'s, ADD & LD & Raymie, 8, NT</div>'

'I think this siutation calls for a professional advocate. To find a good one, go to <A href=\"http://www.copaa.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.copaa.org</A> and click on the Find and Atty/Adv. link. It is illegal for the school district to say they cannot educate any child. If the neighborhood public school cannot, the school district must arrange for some sort of private education at their expense. DEFINITELY get professional help.

'<P>Logan is in the 6th grade this year and is mainstreamed, once again. In an effort to foster some independance, we made the decision to not have an aide for him this year. We did work it into his IEP that if we decided that he still needed the aide, we could have one reintroduced without having to pull together a completely new meeting. So far, so good. Keeping my fingers crossed!</P> <P>I was worried that this year was going to be difficult for him, at least in the begining. Last year, he was in the middle school, but as a fifth grader, they only switched classes three times a day. Once for special classes, such as Technology and then they had the same teacher for Math and Science and they would switch to another teacher for Language and Reading. They didn\'t follow the same bell schedule as the rest of the middle school, either. It seems my worries were for nothing. From the first day he knew what classes he had and the order they were in, he has had no problems making it to each class on time and one of my biggest fears was trying to get him to understand what folders and books needed to be taken to what class. No problems!</P> <P>Logan has been lucky enough to attend the same schools for his entire school career, so far. That means that most of his peers have been around him since kindergarten, some since preschool, and so they know how he acts and while some find him wierd, we have never really had a problem with kids picking on him. What he has really lacked in previous years, are friends. He was extremely popular as a kindergartener, but as his social skills continued to lack, he was unable to keep any real friends. Well, this year, he actually has a friend! Yeah! This boy is also on the spectrum and it\'s a sight to behold when they both get excited and the hand flapping starts. I asked my son what they talk about usually and his response was \"movie franchises\". Now there\'s a conversation I would like to hear. <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley4.gif\" border=\"0\"> </P> <P>He brought home his midterm grades and for the most part I couldn\'t have asked for more. Science - A -, Language - A, Social Studies - A , Reading - C (this was always a subject he has struggled with so I am extremely happy with that C! This was also where his aide came in handy the most.) Math - D (This was a shock because he has always done well in math, but I believe part of it has been due to what they have been studying, prime factorization. He just seems to really be struggling with getting the hang of it.) His other class, Organizational Skills, doesn\'t receive a letter grade and then, instead of having PE, he goes to the Resource Room the last period for homework help, seeing what needs to be brought home to work on, etc.</P> <P>So far, this year has been great, the teachers have been great and we haven\'t had too many fights over homework. I\'m keeping my fingers and toes crossed that the school year continues to be wonderful. Of course, anything\'s better than that terrible year that was fourth grade!<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley11.gif\" border=\"0\"> </P> <P>For those that don\'t remember, my son was the one that had the police called on him three times, once for doing nothing more than tapping his pencil! He was also suspended for six weeks and the teacher contacted child protective services with allegations of abuse and neglect, for which we were quickly exonerated and all files were expunged from the system. The caseworker knew as soon as he talked with our son, our daughter and us, that it was completely unfounded and that part of what had happened was due to our son rote language. Logan became so frustrated with the teacher at one point he threatened to bomb her house with the German Luftwaffe\'s, because she was part of the axis of evil. He even referred to her as Hitler. She was not a good match for him and while I\'m sure she\'s a fine teacher for a NT child, she has no business teaching ASD kids. He was her first and to my knowledge, he has been the last.</P> <P>Anyway, I am happy with the way things are going so far. </P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Sabrys on September 12 2008 at 11:56am</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>-</div>'

'<P>He definitely has some weaknesses. Anything with a score of 84 or below is not good. A score of 84 puts the student in the 15th percentile. That means that 85% of children his <U>same age</U> (and most standardized tests are standardized to take into consideration the exact MONTH the child was born) do better. To think of it another way, the score is equivalent to an IQ score. That is, if a child gets a language score that is 84, it\'s the language level you\'d expect of a child with an 84 IQ. That is not mentally retarded, but it\'s definitely slow. The BIG question is whether or not the District considers this a negative effect on his education. Hopefully, they will and you WON\'T have to resort to an IEE. If you ever think you might be able to afford an advocate, definitely consider hiring one if they don\'t give your son an IEP at this point. </P> <P>Keep us posted.</P>'

'<P>Hi there. I read your posting and wanted to share some info with you. I am the mother of a 15 yr. old daughter with PDD/NOS. She also has been diagnosed with many other things: Tourette\'s, ADHD, OCD and Anxiety Disorder. She was also very premature and not expected to survive. When she was two years old she was found to be missing part of her cerebellum (the 4th ventricle into the brain is not covered and this compromises motor control over the entire body). This has NOT been an easy road to travel for our family and this is our only child. After extensive research, taking our child to every single doctor and then some available, years of therapy.....etc. etc. etc. we have realized that Autism is a genetic/metabolic disorder. Your child does not get this from watching TV programs or anything remotely related to that. There are many different forms of Autism which makes it very difficult to diagnose. Most physicians are at a loss when it comes to diagnoses. We took our daughter to several neurologists and several psychiatrists for her diagnosis. The key to helping these kids is THERAPY - THERAPY - THERAPY. If you can get this - terrific. I recommend OT and Speech. If your son has sensory problems, I also recommend Sensory Integration treatment. Some people don\'t believe that this works, but trust me it does. There are also many things you can do at home and really work with him. We have worked with our child since she was 6 mos. old. The community at large is not going to help you. They can try to make suggestions, but in fact, no one really knows how to help you. My husband and I went to the Option Institute in Sheffield Massachusetts when our daughter was 2 yrs. old. They have a method for working with your autistic child that we have found really works. Our daughter was non-verbal, not walking, terrible behaviors, head banging, spinning, finger flicking etc. Within 3 mos. she was walking, talking and now has improved so much, you would not believe that this was the same child. The reason your son likes Harry Potter so much is because this is his ISM.....autism produces isms - that is, what that child or autistic person really really likes. I cannot explain it to you.....our daughter has been obsessed since the age of 3 with The Little Mermaid. She just loves it so much, that is all she wants to think about and talk about. Your son, from the way you described him, sounds very high functioning. Please feel free to reply back to me.....I will try to help you as much as I can - been doing this for so long now. I still have my moments of confusion too!!!!!!</P> <P>Susan <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"></P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- newagemom</div>'

'jenkovo my sons teacher said she was told this by a neurologist, not sure who she talked to, she thinks because she has worked with special needs kids for 10 years that she knows what she\'s talking about, most people I have come in contact, professionals and otherwise feel like Autism is becoming a blanket dx and that most children just have little things wrong with them that they feel can be fixed and the child will recover and move on in life. This is just my own personal experiences so far, I of course don\'t believe them, but it\'s still hard to not get upset and angry over, it\'s difficult to try to talk to these people when they don\'t want to see it any other way. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Candy, Mother of 2 wonderful children:    Jade: 8 and NT    Leo: 7 and Autistic</div>'

'In my state, at some point you get the assessment plan to approve/disapprove. I think that at that point in time you could refuse to permit the IQ tests you do not want and suggest the non-verbal ones. There is a chance that they do not own the tests, or do not have the training/qualifications administer it and do not want to pay to have it done. They might be BS\'ing to hide this.<br><br>You could allow the test to go ahead with objections and then ask for an independent educational evaluation since you disagree with the IQ testing, should it turn out badly. (Probably best to get local legal advice to do this properly. There are hoops to jump through if you want the SD to pay and actually consider the results.) This might cost a lot of time, but you could at least get an assessor of your choice who might take into account the non-verbal nature of your child.<br><br>You might find some way to analyze the IQ test in the IEP and show that the verbal part is sufficiently different from the other part(s) of the IQ test that the test as a whole is invalid.

'Every child is different (haven\'t you hear that before, LOL?) However, it\'s typical that kids at any point on the Spectrum score lower on a Vineland than on an IQ test. You should compare a Standard Score on the Vineland to a Standard Score on an IQ test. If the IQ is 100 (the dead average standard score), a score of 100 on the Vineland would mean that your child is totally average in intelligence and also totally average in her ability to APPLY her intelligence (that\'s what an adaptive test like the Vineland measure - functional skill, not academic skill). Typically, though, a child with an ASD who scores 100 on an IQ test will score 70 or below on an adaptive test. This is in the borderline MR range of practical ability. Don\'t panic. This is a good thing in a way because it shows that the school has to step in an focus on helping your child APPLY the academics she\'s learning. I don\'t know how the percentiles correlate with standard scores, but I\'m pretty sure they mean she\'ll be score in the below 60 range, which means her ability to apply her knowledge in life is SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIRED. Very typical, even for Asperger\'s kids. What the school has to explain to you is what subtests she did poorly on and what goals on her IEP could address these issues. That\'s the beauty of testing. It tells you EXACTLY what your child\'s weaknesses are and where the school should put its effort. If most of the low scores are in the communication area or if her speech/language if very impaired, I\'d also ask for a nonverbal IQ test, which will test her INTELLIGENCE, not her LANGUAGE ABILITY.'

'That is SO true. The IEP meeting is supposed to be to DEVELOP the IEP. The district needs to be given a reasonable amount of time to get back to you with the official copy. Say, two weeks. In the meantime, you can send them a letter restating what your take is on what was agreed on and putting in writing any remaining issues. Send this certified mail. That puts in writing YOUR opinion of what the IEP will contain. If that is not THEIR opinion, they need to get back to you in writing. In fact, add to the letter a sentence like, \"This is our take on what our son\'s IEP will contain. If you are not in agreement, please respond to us, in writing, about what you believe the result of our meeting was. Thank you.\"'
'I think you need to visit the school preschool to see what it is like. I\'ve worked at special ed preschools and they are often very language intensive and integrate senory and OT activities throughout the day, not just a hour a week or whaterver. Districts usually won\'t pay to have services delivered in another location if they have a program that addresses the child\'s needs.

And many did a great job. Most all TRIED. I also want to let you know that I know the pressure you are typically under to go along with what the District wants during the IEP Team meetings. I am also married to a teacher (not s ed). I can see how many parents actually stand in the way of their kids\' progress in school. The teacher cannot do everything. The parent has to support the teacher in his or her efforts and the parent has to prioritize. ONe thing that has always driven me nuts about my husband\'s students parents is that they often put school sports practice over sending their kids to extra help sessions. My husband holds these sessions on his own time after school and does not get paid to do them. And the parents often say, \"Why don\'t you do these before school since my child has sports practice (or a job or has to sit for his sister, etc.)\" Before school is 6 a.m. and that means we would have to get up at 4:30. Sometimes we parents can be unreasonable! And we can make excuses for our kids. </P> <P>I just wanted the teachers here to know that I understand the pressure you are sometimes under from your administrations and the lack of cooperation you sometimes get from us parents.

'The right sped placement can be extremely helpful. DD was in mainstream w/support from K-4. In 4th grade, things went downhill quickly as the work got more difficult and other kids were less understanding. It didn\'t help that her case manager since K left. So for 5th, we went to self-contained for reading comprehension, social studies, and math. She goes to the mainstream class for science and reading, along with PE, music, and art. The smaller group really helped cut down on the stress and allowed for more individual attention. In our district, we can really fine-tune the placement between self-contained and mainstream, and in middle school there\'s even more flexibility as there are honors, regular, resource and self-contained for each subject, along with mainstream sections that are co-taught with a sped teacher. I wouldn\'t write off a new placement right away. We have very few behavior problems and the smaller setting also allowed more explicit instruction on social skills. Plus, a sped teacher might be more understanding of autism\'s quirks than a reg ed teacher who may make a big deal about everything out of the norm.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Kathy Schlueter</div>'

'<P>She did not necessarily miss out. simply because she was misclassified. Classification in school is only necessary to get an IEP. If she was classified as Speech and Language Impaired, she had an IEP. Once an IEP is given, it really doesn\'t matter what the classification is. Your daughter has the same needs now that she may be able to be classified under autism as she did when she was simply classified as speech impaired. What, exactly, is on her IEP depends on measureable NEEDS, not on medical diagnosis, although a medical diagnosis can and should point the schools toward WHAT needs ought to be evaluated for. That is the point at which you find yourself now. PUT IN WRITING that you want a full psychoeducational evaluation done on your child. This must include an IQ test and full academic testing using standardized measures, at the very least. It ought to also include an interview with a psychologist. I would also ask for a Functional Behavioral Assessment, ideally conducted by a BCBA. THe psychological observation needs to focus on social skills and that report needs to include goals for the social area of the IEP. All of this should have been done long before you got a medical dx of autism. The IEP Team is, by law, required to \"evaluate in all areas of suspected disability\" upon the WRITTEN REQUEST of the parent. If you asked, verbally, do not be surprised that they ignored you. If you asked, in writing, you can use that paper trail to point out to them that they are out of compliance with regulations and that you don\'t want to have to lodge a state complaint. That ought to get them off the dime.</P> <P>BTW, \"early intervention\" refers to birth to 3 services. Many kids miss that period. The issue now is, is your daughter getting the sort of therapies, placement and other supports that enable her to make \"more than trivial\"<BR>progress each year and is she meeting grade level standards as set forth in No Child Left Behind? Importantly, given that she is 8, NCLB requires that ALL children read at the third grade level by the end of third grade or they must get specialized instruction. Put in writing that, as part of her evaluation, you want them to do a comprehensive reading evaluation. This should include recommendations for how to get her to grade level in all areas of reading (decoding, comprehension, fluency, vocabularly, speed). If she does not get at least a standard score of 84 in each of these areas, ask the IEP Team what researched based reading program they are proposing. Use this reading test as a baseline and ask for the same test one year from now. Ask how they plan on monitoring progress in the meantime. If the tests given during this entire evaluation don\' t meet your standards, ask for an IEE for each one you disagree with (search that here or at <A href=\"http://www.wrightslaw.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.wrightslaw.com</A> for plenty more info).

'<br />Did the school do an evaluation for fine motor skills? If he scores below a certain percentile, then he should qualify for OT. Sensory integration alone is not always recognized on its own unfortunately and it would have to be shown that it affects his education. <br /> <br />Is the therapy center private? Why can\'t he start without a diagnosis? In order for insurance to cover, he usually needs to score low on the fine motor eval. Depends on your policy of course. Sensory integration therapy is considered experimental by most insurance companies, so they don\'t cover it alone.

The teacher is wonderful and he is making amazing progress. <br><br>It is time for his IEP, and the school is telling me they don\'t think the self-contained room is his least restrictive environment. They think he is too high functioning to be in that class, and that he would do better in the mainstream, full-day preschool class, with an aide, speech, OT, picture schedule, etc. The case manager also worries that he will pick up behaviors from the other kids in the self-contained class that he doesn\'t currently have, and that his conversation skills won\'t advance as much because several of the other kids in his class are nonverbal. <br><br>I can see their points, all of them. BUT...<br><br>The teacher and aides in the mainstream class are totally uneducated about PDD, and they just don\'t know what to do with him. He has been in that class a few times to try it out, and when I pick him up, he is just wandering around aimlessly. I recently asked why his paper was blank while the other kids had made drawings, and the teacher just said \"he didn\'t do it\".

'<P>ormomoftwo,</P> <P> </P> <P>I\'m from Oregon too. Do you mind saying which ESD you are receiving services through?

I decided not to send him to the special needs preschool and have kept him home instead. He\'s made a good deal of progress this year, but we\'re looking at private therapy options now. There are a lot of parents around here who are less than happy with the services offered in this state, and I\'m afraid it\'s an uphill battle with the school districts. Ironically, the criteria for autism is much broader with the ESDs than it is medically, so any child with a medical dx should automatically carry an ASD label for educational purposes, but there\'s always more hurdles to jump through.

'Remember that behavior = communication. An FBA is supposed to determine WHAT the child is trying to communicate with his behavior - does he want attention? Is he trying to avoid a task? Is he hungry, thirsty, sick? A BCBA can really get to the bottom of things, but others can do a good FBA, too. Still, make certain the person who does the FBA has training in how to do it properly and also knows how to create an ENTIRELY POSITIVE Behavior Intervention Plan. Make certain the BIP is added to your son\'s IEP so that all the people who deal with him in school follow the exact same plan. Consistency is key. And, speaking of consistency, get Parent Training written into the IEP so that the Behavior Plan can be implemented at home as well, making it totally consistent.

'<br /><strong>Involvement in the General Curriculum <br />There are three requirements in IDEA &#146;97 pertaining to the individualized <br />education program (IEP) that specifically mention involvement in the <br />general curriculum: <br /> <br />&#149; The IEP must include a statement of the child&#146;s present levels of <br />educational performance, including how the child&#146;s disability affects the <br />child&#146;s involvement and progress in the general curriculum. <br />&#149; The IEP must include a statement of measurable annual goals, including <br />benchmarks or short-term objectives, related to meeting the child&#146;s <br />needs that result from the child&#146;s disability to enable the child to be <br />involved in and progress in the general curriculum. <br />&#149; The IEP must include a statement of the special education and related <br />services and supplementary aids and services to be provided to the child, <br />or on behalf of the child, and a statement of the program modifications <br />or supports for school personnel that will be provided for the child to be <br />involved and progress in the general curriculum. (20 U.S.C. <br />&#167;&#167;1414(d)(1)(A)(i)-(iii)) <br /> <br />These three requirements translate into important educational obligations <br />for school districts by laying out specific steps that must be taken by the <br />IEP team in order to enable the student to participate in the general <br />curriculum in a meaningful way. In the past, the IEP team had to state <br />the student&#146;s current levels of educational performance; IDEA &#145;97 adds <br />the inclusion of a statement describing the specific effect of the student&#146;s <br />disability on his/her involvement and progress3 in the general <br />curriculum.

'<P>Nick, whenever we have bad weather - my ds immediately insists upon watching the weather channel and worries that we may have to go down in the basement (we DO live in in area where tornadoes can happen!). So, I think he is afraid of them to some extent.</P> <P>He does have an obsession with Peter Pan and Captain Hook as well - THAT I know is not a fear! It is very different in a lot of ways. He enjoys playing pirates with anyone who will - which is awesome because LOTS of little boys (and girls too - my dd loves playing them as well!) want to play pirates. So, THIS obsession actually helps him interact. But, he does talk about it excessively to the point where there are days when I say, \"You can tell me ONE more thing about Captain Hook or ask ONE more question and then we are done for an hour.\" He doesn\'t like this, but I can only take so much - particularly when I am driving. He knows it\'s a \"safety violation\" to keep talking to the driver (this is from Playhouse Disney\'s \"Lou and Lou\'s Safety Patrol\") so that usually stops it for a bit.</P> <P>I do think he would make a good meteorologist some day and I would encourage that. But, he does some stimming where he pretends to BE a hurricane and runs back and forth and swirls all around. That is okay when he is alone, but when friends are over - well, you can guess they find it a bit strange. I have no problem indulging the obsession to some extent - but when it starts to interfere with his friendships and/or starts to make me crazy (especially when I\'m driving) - then I put limits on it. I\'m guessing this is frustrating for him (because I KNOW the situation is frustrating for ME) when I put limits on, but at times I simply have to. It used to be much more difficult to get him to stop talking on a subject, but since he has gotten older (and we have noticed a huge difference in obsessions since he started taking fish oil - and we forgot to give it to him the last three days - which is when the hurricane talk started escalating) it has gotten easier. </P> <P>I don\'t want to dampen his creativity or his curiosity because he has a ton of both and I LOVE that about him. Any suggestions for how to maintain a healthy balance? Thanks so much! </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS (9 yo) diagnosed with mild PDD-NOS and DD (6 yo) NT - but definitely a challenge!</div>'

I always am so pleased to hear of ASD children and adults who do well! I admire you both very much and will always respect the way that you decided was / is best for your son.

'<P>I did not mean to say that, as parents, we shouldn\'t give our child\'s medical histories to the schools when we think those records are important. In fact, we must if we want them to get proper interventions and help at school. What we SHOULDN\'T do is sign a paper that allows them to have DIRECT access to our children\'s medical records (something that Nowwhat didn\'t do, but I thought she did). We should give them what they want directly from our hands, not give them access to the doctor and the records with no restrictions. Many IEP Committees ask for this. Of course, none of us has anything to hide, be we don\'t know how any of these people might INTERPRET things they find in the records. STAYING the gatekeepers to our children\'s private information ensures that only the relevant info gets into the record. Creative minds in the school district can come up with all KINDS of things from the info they dig up. None of us wants unintended consequences. I certainly am not saying that we should feel ashamed or hide things that are relevant, but I think that WE need to be in the driver\'s seat. If only to make the point that WE are the parents and WE can control when and if the school gets private info. Any spec. adv. would advise the same thing. </P> <P>Nowwhat - Your son does need a clinical judgement, but it needs to be from a physician, especially since he seems to be in a gray area. Only a medical dx will trump the school\'s opinion in a hearing. Perhaps the opinion of a neuropsyche will be accepted, but it still is not a medical diagnosis unless it comes from a medical expert - a doctor.</P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by tzoya on September 19 2006 at 5:29pm</span>'

'I wanted to chime in here about 4 or 5 goals. My son has about 20 goals. The problem we have is the school has set really low goals such as in a year they expect him to sit on the potty for 30 secs where I just started potty training at home and he averages about 7 minutes on the potty for an at home baseline. They have a goal or two for each area of need. If your child has a greater amount needs the amount of goals would most likely be higher. 35 may be too much or may not be. I know when I had a file review by an attorney his assessment was that my son needed more goals. My son is on the severe end. What I am trying to say is I would not worry about how many goals as long as the goals fit the needs to the child. It may take one goal it may take 40 goals.<br><br>Stephanie<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Stephanie and Andy on his way</div>'

'Snoopy does your state have any laws about how many children to adults with autism can be in a classroom? I know in our state there has to be a minimum of three adults to every ten children.

'Since my first posting, I\'ve read my way through most of From Emotions to Advocacy, and I\'m partway through the Special Education Law, second edition- which arrived yesterday. It looks like the State Law book I had was from prior to the IDEA 2004 changes, so I\'m also looking up some of the changes on the state website. <br><br>Few bits of news. There will be a new principal at the public school this fall who I don\'t know. The superintendent, who was the superintendent/principal this year and last, knows me and my son very well. The teacher my child had for the past 2 years was pink slipped earlier this year (lay off notice) and likely will not return. I was told that the \"refusal to take him back\" was because they did not have a classroom for him right now- his previous teacher was no longer willing to have him in her class. (What are they going to do, fire her?) The district is small and only has 1 elementary school, with 3 classes per grade. I\'m not likely to be allowed to go out of district when he has an IEP, unless it is done through the district. There is one teacher in my son\'s grade (for next year) that I know of who has dealt with difficult behavior students before, and done it well, I\'m lobbying for her. <br><br>Besides, I really think that <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">now</span> the district is paying attention and really trying (quoting the law to them a few times has helped). They know I\'m giving it my all as well. I\'m (cautiously) optimistic about our ability to work together on this now that the big crisis has calmed down. (yeah, yeah, I read chapter 21 in Emotions to Advocacy, I\'ve got my paper trail in the event that my Pollyanna view bites me in the behind.)<br><br>This morning, I had a 1 hour meeting with his current NPS classroom teacher to discuss what has been working for him at this new school, so we are on the same page for his IEP meeting. I had written some IEP goals and gave him a copy, and that is what prompted our meeting. Here\'s one sample goal I wrote that doesn\'t get too personal...<br><br>P<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">lacement Goal: By August 2007, [my child] will be placed in a regular education classroom with clear and consistent rules, taught by a teacher with a professional clear multiple subject credential (not a preliminary credential), who has been trained in behavior techniques and interventions by a qualified behaviorist who is familiar with [my child]\'s behavior Responsibility: Principal.</span><br><br>I\'ve written several goals (specific, like the one above) in the area of placement, behavior progress, and academic progress. I also suggested some tweeks to the wording of his behavior intervention plan (I\'m still fuzzy on how to word BIP items- can anyone recommend a book?). The Speech and Language person, and the School Psychologist each gave me 2 proposed goals they came up with at our last meeting. They look ok, based on the SMART IEP model. His teacher, this morning, gave me a few more ideas on how to address the behavior goals. <br><br>I\'m feeling better about this every minute. I think that when I take charge of this, instead of trusting the judgment of the school, good things will happen. When <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">I</span> write his IEP goals I\'m \"steering the ship\". He\'s my kid, and I have had LOTS more time to observe and research this problem than anyone else on that IEP team. I can come up with solutions, and I can back up my recommendations with observational data if they try to shoot them down. Armed with information, I can do this!! Thanks for the referrals to these great books as well as the advice. <br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Ben\'s mom</div>'

'One of the issues with a label is discipline. IF a child violates codes of conduct, he can be suspended just like any other child - but only for up to 10 days. After that, the school has to have a Manifestation Determination Hearing to see if there is a connection between the disability and the misbehavior. If there is, then the suspension has to be erased, the IEP adjusted to help with the behavior and the child can no longer be suspended or punished for that behavior. ALthought the entire IEP is considered at these hearings, I\'ve had experience as an advocate that shows me that many school districts give inordinate weight to the CLASSIFICATION during these proceedings. MR may not cover many of the autistic behaviors that AUTISM will. Don\'t change your child\'s classification. Ask why THEY want to since he DOES have autism and AUTISM is a more correct descriptions of his disability.'
'Ok I have heard all the horror stories about the schools. I had our meeting at the school and they wanted to classify her as dev. delayed which would stay with her untill she is 9. I called the parent information center and they told me all kinds of helpful info. they said that pdd-nos isn;t one of the 16 listed disabalities. ANd because she is so high functiong she wouldn\'t fall under the autisum label. So she is still entled to summer school and school in the fall. They did tell me that her iep should accuratly describe dd, and I could hve them put pdd-nos in parenthesis with her dx. I guess I am wondering about academic performance or an iq test. I had a hard time really hearing their response at the meeting because dd was wild and tearing apart their toys. Not in a bad way just an overexcited way...

'<P>Just an update. The IEP went really well. It took a long time 3 hours but we completely re wrote Corbin\'s IEP. We started with OT Corbin will begin OT and will be allowed 30 minutes for OT once a week. His OT goal is to be able to write a 4-5 word sentance legibly in 36 weeks. milestones are 5-07 all 52 upper and lower case letters, 2 word phrases by 5-07 also, 3 word pharses by 11-07 and 4-5 word sentances by 1-08. This will keep him on track with the rest of his Kindergarten class. </P> <P>SLP was increased to 160 minutes a month baseline on wh was 70-80% acccuracy, irregular past tense verbs 11/20, and irregular plural nouns 8/16. In 32 weeks these should all be at 100%. March wh 80%, grammar structures at 70%. May wh 80-85%, grammar structures 70-80%, October wh 85-90%, grammar structures 80-90%, and december wh 90%+, grammar structures 90%+. SLP continued. Corbin will initiate play and use turn taking skills in age appropriate conversation. Base line is 50%, march 60-70, may 70-80. october 80-90, december 90+. </P> <P>The behavior plan was reviewed and went well. We have chosen a token currency economy to work on behaviors with Corbin. He has been given a set of rules/PECS that is laminated and fixed to his desk in special ed and gen. ed at all times. He begins each hour and 1/2 period with 5 tokens. Every time he breaks a small rule (stomping, growling, crying, shouting, making excuses to not do work, or using mean talk he will lose one token. The token is worth 5 minutes of free time in the special ed room where he will choose an activity he enjoys. For the first few days things will be a bit lenient just to show Corbin if he keeps his tokens he gets to pick his own activity. </P> <P>Serious offenses including hitting, pinching, pushing and kicking will be dealt with a bit differently. These happen rarely at school thank goodness. When it does happen Corbin will be given two PECS pictures to color one that shows an injury and one with a sad crying fact. He will color these pictures and glue them to a sheet of paper. On that paper he will write. I am sorry. I shouldn\'t have \"insert offense here\" you. and his name on the last line. He will then have to present this sheet to whoever he harmed. He will also be given a social story to cut out arrange and paste to a paper and this will be read to him by the teacher. </P> <P>I am pretty happy with this system. While Corbin will be \"being punished\" per se the punishment will help him work on one of his biggest weaknesses which is fine motor skills. Plus him striking or physically harming someone at school is rare so it won\'t be something that happens every day thank goodness. I am THRILLED that we finally have the same set of rules for the entire building and no more these are the outside rules, these are the inside rules, these are the spec. ed room rules, these are the k class rules. That was not working. He also has goals here as to how many tokens he will keep coinciding with the quarters of the year. </P> <P>His writing system will be changed to handwriting without tears. As far as training there will be an inservice held with the AEA Autism Resource Team held for all teachers and paras for K-3rd grade on Autism and characteristics of an individual with Autism and how to deal with behaviors etc. This will also include Phys. Ed. and Music instructors. The Autism Resource Team will also come watch Corbin in his classroom and then speak to teachers on how to deal with certain behaviors when they occur. This will happen both in and out of the classroom setting. They will also be sending Jason and I resources such as videos etc. for our knowledge. </P> <P>He will receive extended school year services for transitioning to first grade. WE will be starting a communication notebook between school and home. He will have a daily schedule in PECS secured to his desk. </P> <P>The only thing we didn\'t really get much done with is the P. E. thing and we all need more information on the specific problem in that situation so I will be contacting his Phys. Ed. teacher tomorrow. I think I got it all but I could be wrong. Dh and I are fairly happy with the outcome of the whole thing. I didn\'t even have to pull out my big guns. Though the principle got pretty crabby when I remembered to bring up the training issue. However, at that point we had been in there nearly 3 hours. I think they thought I would forget about it. I am extremely thrilled though as far as acedemics (aside from handwriting) Corbin is excelling in reading and math and we have chosen to remove those things from his IEP and they will not be put back on unless we begin to see a problem in those areas. </P> <P>And woo hoo after 3 IEP meetings this year I think, hope, we are finally done until next fall where we will regroup with his new instructor! </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>-</div>'

I was informed that my child would have to be retested because his diagnosis is \"Autism Spectrum Disorder\" and not simply \"Autism\". I must disagree and question you as to the reasons why retesting is necessary. It is a well known fact that \"Autism\" is a spectrum disorder, and regardless of where an individual falls along the spectrum, he or she still has AUTISM. Autism by it\'s very nature requires special education services as children with autism are unable to communicate or socialize like typical children can. They also engage in certain ritualistic or repetitive behaviors which vary from child to child. According to the book, \"Educating Children With Autism\" by the National Research Council, eighth printing Oct 2005, page 213, \"Because of their shared continuities and their unique social difficulties, children with any autistic spectrum disorder......., regardless of level of severity or function, should be eligible for special educational services within the category of <EM>autistic spectrum disorders,</EM> as opposed to other terminology used by school systems.....\"</FONT></strong></P> <P><strong><FONT size=3>In addition, I was shocked that a Speech Therapist would feel qualified to make a statement implying that my child \"does not have an educational need\". My son deserves a FAPE, or Free Appropriate Public Education, just like every other child in this school district. As you already know, time is of the essence when it comes to autism, and aggressive early intervention is universally considered to be the best way to help the ever growing numbers of children with autism in this country have their best chance at a successful future.</FONT></strong></P> <P><strong><FONT size=3>Finally, I am including a letter from Dr.-, my son\'s developmental pediatrician, detailing exactly why my child has been diagnosed as having an autism spectrum disorder and outlining the interventions that he/she feels are necessary for my child to receive a FAPE from this school district.</FONT></strong></P> <P><strong><FONT size=3>I will be contacting you within a week to discuss the matter further.

'<P>Thinks have been going much better in school but one of the remaining problems seems to be that the teachers on his school do not talk to each other. At the beginning of the year ds had huge problems in the mainstream class but was doing well in the resource room and the mainstream teacher never bothered to talk to the resource room or me about it. Well, we had a meeting where everyone acknowledged the communication problems and promised to do better. During a part of a meeting where the mainstream teacher was not present it was decided that ds should get pulled into small groups with appropriate kids while in mainstream class and that they should also work on independence skills like ds gathering his own class materials. Well, it is a month later and I just talked to the mainstream teacher and she was not aware of this. Obviously communication has not improved.</P> <P>So whose responsibility is it to pass on information ? Is it the classroom teacher\'s responsibility to find out about things that should happen in her room? Is it the resourceroom teacher\'s job to pass IEP info on to the classroom teacher? It is the SW who calls the meetings, so is it her responsibility to pass team decisions on to everyone? Is it the principales responsibility to make sure his staff has some pre-established communication route?</P> <P>Obviously I can and will from now on summerize every meeting and e-mail it to everyone on ds\'s IEP team but I still need to be reassured that teachers talk amongst each other.

'It\'s a Functional Behavioral Assessment designed to observe the behaviors that are undesirable and to find out the FUNCTION of the behavior. For example, is the child doing the behavior for attention or to escape doing a task? It\'s vital to know WHY a child is behaving in a certain way in order to create a Behavior Intervention Plan that actually works. For more info, go to cecp.air.org and search Functional Behavioral Assessments and Behavior Intervention Plans.'
'<P>Wendy - You\'ve come to the right place for help. Unfortunately, time is not on your side here. </P> <P>Given you have a meeting scheduled tomorrow, you\'re a bit under the gun to learn all you need to learn to deal with this situation. The reality is, there are laws in place to address this type of situation because it\'s recognized that a child with a disability can have behavioral issues that are a MANIFESTATION OF THEIR DISABILITY. However, you need answers now.</P> <P>First thing you need to do is insist they perform a Functional Behavioral Assessment on your son. This needs to be done by someone qualified to perform one....not the teacher. Ideally, someone from the outside with credentials. The FBA will identify the things that are causing the behavior (all behavior from a child with autism has a cause). Once this information is collected and analyzed, a Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP) is established and becomes part of your child\'s IEP. The BIP should consist predominately of positive behavior interventions to address those things that cause a negative reaction in your son. All individuals who work with your child should be trained in how to implement these methods.</P> <P>Secondly, review the Wrightslaw website located at:</P> <P><A href=\"http://www.wrightslaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.wrightslaw.com/</A></P> <P>It has a wealth of information related to advocating for your child. I strongly recommend you purchase and read the book, \"From Emotions to Advocacy\".

Seems to me they have no idea how to handle this situation properly and are probably hoping you\'ll move him to a different school.

'A child by law is allowed all services and help with what ever it takes to be a sucess at school.The diagnoses doesn\'t matter as long as a need can be proven, This is Federal Law.'
'No'
'<P>I would definitely get legal advice on this. The truth is, I wouldn\'t want my son in a school that doesn\'t WANT him. He WON\'T get the proper education there. I have no idea why you opted for a change of schools, but this school is clearly the WRONG school. Kids like ours needs very specialized interventions. It\'s feasible to get them thru 504, but school districts don\'t get reimbursed from the Feds AT ALL for 504 interventions whereas they get reimbursed a small percentage (I believe it averages 17%) for interventions in an IEP. So agreeing to a 504 essentially means \"Yes, my son has a disability, but he only needs accommodations and modifications that won\'t cost you anything.\" Your district is paying tuition to the new district, so your son is a profit center for them. But, clearly, they are only interested in making a profit off kids who are no trouble to them. YOur district is OBLIGATED to pay tuition at the school of your choice, but the receiving school is NOT obligated to take a particular child. If it were me, I\'d hire a lawyer or advocate.

'I asked the speech therapist to move one speech pull out session from an e day to an a day. She agreed, but the superintendent and principal decided that this was not going to work. I requested a written statement with the reason for their refusal to implement the changes, but the response was that the speech therapist does not have to provide me with a written explanation. The principal/CSE chairperson decided she will write a statement, which I am yet to receive. Is is appropriate to request a Written Prior Notification in this case?

'My son goes to a parocial school. (I don\'t know if you are counting this as private) He always has. The classes typically are smaller. There are about 16 kids in his class. This is the largest class he has ever been in so far. The behaviors are usually in check. (He is in the 7th grade.) <strong><FONT size=2>Therapy services are limited. My son did not qualify for any \'services.\' </FONT></strong>The evaluation was done by our public school system. I badly wanted OT for his handwriting!!! Luckily, the school is great with Keith. He has an IP that says he can use a computer for the majority of his work. He also gets a small break durring the day (10 minutes to unwind), and the last hour of the day he goes to the resource room to study and do home work. Currently after school he is in wrestling. So far he is doing ok with it. I think it gives him something to look foreward to since he enjoys being in the group so much!<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley4.gif\" border=\"0\"> I like that he is directly interacting with other kids of different ages.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Janis  Son 16 PDD-nos, Son 16 NT  Daughter 18 NT, Daughter 20 NT  All great!</div>'
'We are in Florida, in South Tampa, and there are a few things that could be better, but overall I am very pleased. Of couse we came from DC that was horrible, they dropped a lot of the services that DC\'s early intervention recommended, and the school psychologist told me flat out they were not autistic. I believed her. they gave me 2 schools to visit then told me they were going to a totally different one, and when I said I had already picked one of the ones they gave me, they told me that this other school would be the school they would attend or they wouldn\'t attend. I didn\'t have to send them to preschool it was voluntary. Actually that isn\'t true, but I believed it at the time. It took me an hour to get them to school everyday, which now I know is actually illegal. So Florida was a Godsend for us. It was actually the school in Florida who brought up autism again, has worked closely with the psychologist for a diagnosis, doubled their speech therapy from the DC IEP and is going to add OT and probably PT. There are too many kids in that class and it is a very mixed class. She definitely needs another aide and is fighting the county to get one, but she is absolutely committed to those children and to learning whatever she needs to help them. She\'s been working very closely with Nikolas lately and he doesn\'t like it at all but his vocabulary has doubled and his relationship with his brother and sister especially has really changed since he started school here in Nov. He initiates hugs and playing together. I\'m not crazy about the speech therapist, if I don\'t stay on top of her they don\'t get the amount of speech in their IEP, so I crack the whip and threaten and she does what she\'s suppose to. So far they have been on the whole very supportive and have worked to get those boys what they need, finally. After we get the DX for autism if that\'s what it is we will talk about an autism school or if they would be better leaving them where they are. But I\'ve been happy on the whole with Tampa.

'I\'m going to a meeting at my childs school with the team that works with my child she is in K. I requested evals to be done like a full eval in all areas of delay and an FBA and sensory eval. Is there anything specific i should ask for, tests for instance? I want them to evaluate her in all areas including social, adaptive, cognitive though i think they did an IQ test on my child before the transition to K. Or do i just ask them to evaluate in all areas of delay and they will just perform the tests? I signed the form already for them to evalute. I want to see how much progress my child is really making, the last eval was 3 years ago.'

'This is a prime example of how the HUMAN interaction in an IEP Team is more important even than the law. Of course, in the end the law will triumph, but it\'s already been nearly a month.

What I don\'t understand is why the school district\'s own lawyer doesn\'t sit down with that Superintendent and explain the Facts of Life under IDEA. Good for you for getting an advocate.

'Hmmm... well snoop, I am not sure how much help I can be eather tho I did learn how to tell time and dates at a very early age I dont feel I was ever obsessed with the things Marty\'s son was obsessed with. <br /> <br />I know like ADHA their are things that can distract an ASD kid, putting them off task. It sounds like its serious if you are considering medication! I know for me I always had a thing with needing to constantly know the time. So like your son I would be looking at the clock pretty frequently, tho only few have noticed it. <br /> <br />As a kid I always enjoyed things with buttons, and always loved using the computer, but of course when I was your sons age computers were much more rair in class, still got to use um tho! <br /> <br />Sounds like he is just a very \'typical\' ASD kid to me. He is just curious and probably wants to learn how to tell time and operate a computer, perhapse you can teach him to satisfy his curiosity. <br /> <br />Their was some different advice from Snoopy and Norway that is also something to look into. My 2 cents is just curiocity, he probably does not like sitting at the desk and being lectured, hes smart and so wants to learn about these things, outa curiousness. <br /> <br />I know in 3rd grade (I was the youngest spec ed kid in this class) the older kids were learning how to do more advanced multyplication. I became pretty obsessed with the times chart and really wanted to be shown how to do these 5th and 6th grade math problems. I was curious and learned earler then my peers how to do it, teacher was awsome and I was a bit ahead of my 3rd grade class in math by a few years at least in multyplication. <br /> <br />The stress/anxiety thing was interesting too. I know I do tend to look at clocks more frequently when stress and anxiety levels are higher then normal, and that does catch the attention of people around me, at least it used too.

'This mom rocks - yes, the old IEP remains in effect until the parent and the District agree UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF THE COMING SCHOOL YEAR - OR - if the parent claims \"pendency\" (\"stay put\") by taking the District to Due Process. That means putting in a Hearing Request. If the parent does not do this, the District takes the lead and puts in place the new IEP. Unless your state REQUIRES a signature to OK the IEP yearly (this is NOT required by IDEA), the District does not have to get the parent\'s officially agreement and the only way the parent can officially DISAGREE is to go to Due Process by putting in a Hearing Request or requesting Mediation. If not, there is no Federal right to keep the old IEP in place. Of course, negotiation on an individual basis (i.e., successful advocacy) can put ANYTHING into agreement.'

She recommended a lawyer who I heard the name of once before (shes supposed to be really good) Well this lady tells me she is like the best of the best and that you even write her name on a piece of paper and set it on the table where the school can see it the schools FEAR her.

'callista <br />have you talked with the colleges special education center for help. do uour professors know what is on your IEP. It will be hard but if you can explain to the professor what is going on with you he/she might be able to accomidate you better. the book i read as somthing like autism and the college dream. I really liked it and it helped me to learn that there are a lot of sevices for disabilities. If you have a hard time taking notes you can have someone make copies of heres. <br /> <br />my son is 4 and as autism. Right mow my focus is to help with with speech, manners, appropiate social interactions. once he goes to middle and high school I plan to help him learn how to do his own IEPS when he is old enough. have you done your own IEP\'s? <br /> <br />? when did you get diagnosed with autism? when did you start to talk with more than one words and get them all together. <br /> <br />my son was on course until he hit 18 months. I realized something is different when he was 2. he has had intencse <br />ABA when he has younger(about a year0 that worked for him and now he has PRT a more play learn type of therapy. I like how things are going so far. I am of course worried about school, college, and life on own, in a facility, etc? I am interested in seeing adult programs to help adults how no longer get all ther services under the age of21. what do you think about all this? <br /> <br />are you comfortable telling your professor that you have autism and you need provisions to help to do your work? <br />meri'
'I guess I should have been more clear. I didn\'t think your daughter\'s group had typically developing children in it. I was just trying to explain why I thought my son\'s group sessions were beneficial; he has those kids as models. If his group session consisted of only other disabled peers whose issues were just as severe as his, I would not be happy with that either.<br><br>Well, lots of schools do 1:1 and consider it educational therapy. I can say I\'ve never heard that one. Would a child working one on one with a teacher on academic goals be getting \"medical tutoring?\" Their definition is flawed. Ask them for the LAW, state or federal, that defines 1:1 as \"medical therapy\" in writing. That\'s where I would start. <br><br>I would also start digging up research that shows it is best practice to teach new skills in an intensive teaching session (i.e. discrete trials one on one) before using a group to generalize those skills.<br><br>Hopefully others will have other advice for you.<br> <br>'

See page 32 in the PDF file (page 140 in the actual book).</P> <P align=left>It\'s not easy to communicate when your head is nothing but chaos, but if the staff reacts appropriately to escalation to meltdown or full-blown meltdown, your son should be able to communicate more quickly, and it sounds like he\'ll be able to use PECS more quickly than finding his words. I hope you can convince the school of that, but at least you seem to have the support and understanding of one teacher.</P> <P>As far as speech goes, I don\'t know that speech therapy will help him communicate during a meltdown, but there are certainly other reasons to push for speech therapy. Even if a child with ASD has a good vocabulary and no articulation problems, s/he will still usually have problems with the social/pragmatic use of speech. Here\'s a checklist for evaluating that type of speech, which might help you specify why you think speech is necessary for your child.</P> <P><A href=\"http://dlserver.samford.edu/eportfolio/Portfolios/ElaineThagard/adaptive_Problem_Solving/checklist_for_SocioPragmatic_Language_Behaviors.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> http://dlserver.samford.edu/eportfolio/Portfolios/ElaineThag ard/adaptive_Problem_Solving/checklist_for_SocioPragmatic_La nguage_Behaviors.pdf</A></P> <P>I think it\'s reasonable for you to ask for an IEP meeting to discuss these issues.</P> <P>Good luck with everything!</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Norway Mom (mother of 2 sons who were born in 1998 and 2001.

'My understanding is that you can only make minor changes <br />to the IEP without holding a team meeting. The info I <br />can find on Wrightslaw states that you can amend the IEP <br />without holding a team meeting. <br /> <br />\"Revising IEP by Agreement, Without an IEP Meeting <br /> <br />IDEA 2004 changed the process by which IEPs can be <br />amended or modified. If the parent and school agree to <br />amend or modify the IEP, they may revise the IEP by <br />agreement without convening an IEP meeting. <br /> <br />The team must create a written document that describes <br />the changes or modifications in the IEP and note that, by <br />agreement of the parties, an IEP meeting was not held. <br />(Section 1414(d)(3)(D))\" <br /> <br />If you\'re meeting to discuss the placement change you\'ve <br />talked about in previous threads, I would not consider <br />that a minor change. Again from Wrightslaw: <br />\" The decision about placement cannot be made until after <br />the IEP team, which includes the parent, reaches <br />consensus about the child&#146;s needs, program, and goals.\" <br /> <br />Both can be found here: <br />http://www.wrightslaw.com/idea/art/iep.roadmap.htm <br /> <br />At any rate, you need to talk with the director and find <br />out if the hold up is b/c they are trying to convene a <br />full team meeting. If you want something different, be <br />explicit about that and find out if it\'s possible to <br />discuss this issue and make a decision without the full <br />team there. They may refuse to discuss the issue without <br />a full team meeting due to perceived liability issues. <br /> <br />'

Or his behavior is really out of anyone\'s control and it\'s time to consider medication or a much more restrictive environment. If your child is having THIS much difficulty, something is sorely wrong. And the fact that he is not like this at home doesn\'t matter. Many kids are very different in school vs home. I think you need the input of the behavioral specialist on this one. Someone who KNOWS autism and can observe your son in his current situation and figure our what to do. Honestly, if he is getting violent, there has to be SOME measure in place to keep him from hurting himself and others. Under the circumstances described by the IEP team, do you have any alternative suggestions for an emergency?'
'<P>Hi everyone,</P> <P>My son is 3 and receives private speech and OT. We gave our school district 3 months and he recieved not one unit of speech. The SD preschool was awful and the teacher quit. He cried his eyes out every morning of the 3 months they made him walk in alone (yes, no parents allowed). I know a lot of people are saying to fight. I have spoken to the State\'s SpEd Attorney and my FIL is an attorney. If we fight, we might get reimbursement in 10 years. Hy husband will never want him back in that preschool again. Our insurance does not cover the expenses yet for speech and OT. He is also in a social speech group for 3 year olds.</P> <P>I digress... He\'s now in Private Preschool (not special needs) and speech and OT. He\'s been diagnosed with Mild ASD to moderate. My question is that he\'s been having behavioural issues - stripping his clothes off, standing on tables at school. And saying he doesn\'t want school. </P> <P>Do I contact a Behavioral Psychologist? I am not sure how to help him with this because he is unable to elaborate on events. I usually have to rely on his teacher to explain what happened that day. For example: yesterday, pouring cups of water on himself at naptime.</P> <P>Any suggestions on Behavioral Health?</P> <P> </P> <P> </P>'

'YOu need to explain to your son that, due to his disability, it may take him up to 4 years longer to get his HS diploma. Get yearly standardized testing that shows whether or not he has made actual progress. It is our job, as parents, to figure out ways to explain this to our kids so that they are not so competitive and aware of their deficits. Teaching them that we ALL progress at our own pace and that each person in this world has different gifts and challenges is one of the \"facts of life\" that all children must learn. Whatever you can do to alleviate the stress and convince your son (and yourself) that \"personal best\" is all we ought to ask will be truly beneficial to him. Good luck.'

'It\'s to bad the pre-k teacher wasn\'t there...from what it sounds like, next to you, she is the biggest advocate for your daughter. I wonder if the pre-k teacher can provide a letter from her detailing your daughter\'s progress and the reasons for moving to regular Kindy. I think things can be attached to the IEP paperwork, but not necessarily considered for the IEP. Someone with more experience on that wold know better.<br><br>Yes, splitting time between two schools as in 1/2 day reg and 1/2 day ABA. A scenario presented to me by the ABA educational services coordinator was, Maybe CJ spends half days at reg. school, and the other half at the ABA school in the age-approriate classroom. They would request a copy of the curriculum from the reg. school so they could work on things with him. Maybe he\'s in this scenario for say, two weeks. Then, he begins to spend one full day at reg. kindy and the rest of his wek remains the same split. Then, once that seems to work, he spends 2 full days at reg kndy and so on until he is completely full day, full week at his reg. kindy and adjusts just fine to it all. She told me in other cases where they\'ve done this, some kids are done in two weeks, some in two months and some in 6. there is no timeline set; it is on the child\'s comfort timetable. <br><br>In my SD, our chairperson never heard of that being done, but in other districts in the neighboring county it has been done successfully. I\'m not sure of transportation, but I\'m thinking I\'ll be driving out and back every day. Whatever it takes<img src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\">.<br><br>Again, CJ already is already a student at the ABA school, so his situtation would be to lessen the shock of going to a regular classroom. However, they have been taking the ABA children to the Campus Preschool which is typical children, to see how well they integrate and see if the child can function in that setting. Staff of the ABA school are always present. Cj spends Tues and Thurs mornings there apparantly (that\'s what I was told he would be doing anyway-he can\'t really tell me what he did there other than he ate apples and cantelope and sang Five Little Monkeys). <br><br>Anyway, I think yes, you should go back for a lengthier, more detailed meeting with the school crew and see what, if anything, can be done to accommodate your daughter.<br><br>The whole won\'t budge thing: that\'s my worry right now. We are mainstreaming our son to a private Catholic School on our own dime (we have a history there). And in my state, he gets the same things as if he was in the public school. But, there will be new SD people at the transition meeting who know nothing about him, and the thought of them weighing in on something (especially when we\'re straying from the norm by going private school) makes me very anxious. <br><br>If you do get another meeting that school, make it very clear your concerns for the social skills and see what they have to say. And don\'t rule out the extracurricular activities like I mentioned before (well, maybe not the exact same ones my son does, but you know what I mean<img src=\"smileys/smiley36.gif\" border=\"0\"> ) Sounds to me like she is ready for kindy.

'First, you probably should request an IEP meeting as soon as possible. In AZ, we have 15 days from the request. The IEP should have a place for parent concerns. Also, the general education teacher should be at your child\'s IEP meeting. If your child is falling behind in general education, perhaps it might be better to have your child return temporarily to the resource room during math, reading, and writing in order to have the special education teacher do more interventions with your child. Additionally, you should consider assisting with creating a behavior intervention plan (BIP) for your child with the IEP team. As a teacher, I go first at the behaviors.

We got everything we wanted and we\'re very comfortable with his placement for next year.</P> <P>He\'s in mainstream kindergarten with a 1:1 aide this year, and next year for 1st grade he\'ll be in a LOP classroom. LOP is \"Learning Opportunities Program\" and classes are max 12 kids with 2 aides. Classmates will be a mix of ASD, mild cognitive impairment and possibly some of the more severe speech/language kids. The kids are all mainstreamed for specials (art, PE, computers) as well as for recess and lunch. While C is making good progress in mainstream K this year, he needs so much support from his aide that he isn\'t really functioning independently at all and he is pulled out so much (speech, ot, social work, learning center) that it is difficult for him to really feel a part of the class and make friends with other kids.</P> <P>We did the observation tour a few weeks ago and did 90 minute observations each of 2 different LOP classrooms (one a K/1 and the other a 1/2), a regular ed 1st grade and C\'s current K class. Prior to the observations, I was stressing out over placement to the point where I couldn\'t eat, sleep, or think/talk about anything else.

'I am fairly sure that MGW\'s book \"Think Social\" has some IEP goals listed in it that correlate to the curriculum. You might want to take a look there. <br /> <br />Social Thinking is not specifically mentioned in my kids\' IEP either. But we discussed using it as one of the methods to achieve their goals (e.g. improving flexibility). Not the only method though. <br /> <br />Good luck. It has been slow going to get this implemented at school (over 2 years). They are not following the curriculum as of yet, but at are starting to used the terminology and behavioral mapping more. Also using the \"social detective\" concept. <br /> <br />We have had Social Thinking at a private social skills group. They start out with a Social Thinking lesson (as a group) for the first half of the session, then break up into smaller groups to play for the second half. <br /> <br /> <br />- <br /> <br />mom to 10 year old boy/girl twins (Asperger\'s/PDD-NOS) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by mbmom on February 03 2010 at 3:54pm</span>'

'I thought I\'d post an update about how things are going with the new school. (kind of a follow up on the question abut laws thread that I started a couple wks ago)<br>The boys had their first day yesterday, and it was a great first day! I love, love love this new district! It\'s the polar opposite of the last one in almost every way! The teacher is very educated in ASD, and also has a daughter that has aspergers. She wasted no time getting things going with the boys. She already has a whole new plan as to what they need, and we\'ll be meeting in a few wks to redo the IEP after she gets to know the both of them better. She also wants to do additional testing on my 5 yo. His speech has exploded in the last few months, so his PLOP is very different now then what it was in May when the other school tested him. She was floored with all that he knows, as he is above average in many academic areas. However his language,and social skills are still very delayed. She has some really good ideas for the both of them, and I can\'t wait to update the IEP. The teacher is very upset about how the other school went about things. They didn\'t even transfer most of the paperwork over. I had to fill out all the enrollment forms, and all that yesterday when I dropped them off. The weird thing is that they also tranferred the aide that was working with my youngest. I was shocked to see her there yesterday, too. They got rid of us like a hot potato. It does seem like they\'re trying to cover up the whole restraint situation. No matter, as things have worked out very well on the boys\' behalf. I\'m very happy with their new placement! I just wanted to share the good news. <img src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"><br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to Chandra(8yrs.) Nathaniel(5 yrs.)ADHD,PDD Ian (3 yrs.)ASD</div>'
'<P> </P> <P>Hi Karolysgirl,</P> <P>I was going to change the term, \"educators\" to \"school officials\" but then I truly believe that too many teachers and other staff members are extremely reticent to speak out about the inappropriate services that so many children on the spectrum receive. In my own district, two teachers confided that their jobs were \"on the line\" if they protested - at least publicly. Needless to say, they did not voice an opinion contrary to the district and would have readily gone against us in a court of law if our case was not settled.</P> <P>This is NOT an unusual circumstance. I have heard this same story (i.e., lack of support from teachers - in terms of speaking out publicly against the powers that be) too many times from so many other parents. There are not as many \"Erin Brockovich\'s\" as you think.</P> <P>And while I commend you for your dedication and commitment to your students, there are too many teachers that are not prepared, motivated and competent to make the proverbial difference in a child\'s life - especially teaching those on the spectrum, particularly when there are too many children in the classroom. There is a high burnout rate, too, especially when educating those who are manifesting extreme behaviors. </P> <P>We often talk about a child\'s program. While acknowledging the importance of a program, I contend that it is equally/perhaps more important WHO the child\'s teacher is and shadow/therapist. </P>'
'The school district is REQUIRED to give you a list. However, you are not required to USE the list. What I do is choose the evaluator and then tell the District. I make them make all the financial arrangements. It\'s true that Districts can put a limit on the amount of money spent, but that limit has to be in line with the usual charges for the sort of evaluation sought, not less. I avoid all this by letting THEM negotiate with the evaluator. I\'ve actually had very few outside evals and have never run into trouble doing this. The districts are allowed and actually even required to make sure that the evaluator you choose has at least the same qualifications as the evaluator they\'ve used (for example, if they\'ve used a certified OT for an eval, you can\'t just go to a chiropractor to get another opinion). HOwever, beyond making sure the qualifications are sound and the price is fair, they cannot restrict the IEE further, although many districts will try. In that case, you can pay for the eval yourself and seek reimbursement through mediation, a resolution session, a hearing or even by submitting a state complaint (tho none of these methods is guaranteed to get you remibursement). One of the choices is to get an independent eval using your own funding (either direct pay or insurance). If course, this costs you money. However, the big advantage is then YOU are in control of the results. When you get an eval paid for by the district, THEY get the results first and the results HAVE to be a part of the official record, just the way the results of the original eval are. If YOU pay, YOU get the report first and you can CHOOSE to share the results or not. You don\'t even have to tell the district you\'re getting your child evaluated unless you CHOOSE to share the results. I am not advocating avoiding an IEE paid for by the district. I\'m just pointing out that there is more than one way to skin a cat and also that there are options based on how much control you need in a given situation.'

'Make certain it\'s utterly clear what the responsibilities of the aide will be. I would want her to be primarily responsible for reinforcing the behvior plan. If the current behavior plan is not working, it\'s the responsibiity of the author(s) of that plan to adjust it until it DOES work. Typically, plans fail because they either do not use reinforcers that are truly reinforcing to the particular child or they have mistaken what the FUNCTION of the behavior is. Address these in your next meeting.'

'<P>Okay, so Blake has been going to a special needs daycare/preschool (created through our County DD) called Calico since he was 2. At the time, he had an IFSP and all his services were granted through the daycare. When he turned 3 or course his services turned over to the local school district. He still has DD eligibility, however the school district is our primary source of services (or lack there of <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley2.gif\" border=\"0\">). For the first year, the school district granted him itinerate services and sent a preschool teacher to Calico 1 day a week. This was great, I was just happy they were willing to do an IEP at all. Then it was recommended that we may want to start sending Blake to the actual preschool half days to start getting him used to transition and the kids he\'ll grow up with. I agreed. Well, he constantly tells me he hates it. He begs me in the mornings to stay at Calico all day. He mostly says he hates the bus (noises he says bother him). We bought him a nice pair of headphones and the school lost them. </P> <P>So Blake has 1.5 years left before he starts kindergarten. My question is, do I continue to force him to go to a school he hates? Which in turn is becoming a safety concerns for the other kids from his outlashs. Byt the time the bus brings him back to Calico, he\'s so aggigated he\'s pretty much intolerable. We have an IEP review session coming up and I\'m thinking about asking for the itinerate services again. I really just want them to grant OT. But they only keep giving me OT, ST and PT <EM>consult </EM>services. They teach the teachers kind of thing. I haven\'t complained much because Calico (the special needs daycare) has on staff OT, PT, ST and his teacher has a son with aspergers by chance. So when at calico he\'s getting everything he needs.</P> <P>I\'m just torn. My mother keeps telling me...most kids don\'t even go to preschool, why does our poor baby boy have to suffer through 2?! I think she has a point. Any opinions? </P> <P>I feel like, if he can keep going to the preschool kids he\'ll grow up with. Since they are so young they see past the arm flapping and social oddness.

'I would ask for a parent handbook about School rules and regulations, I get one every year at registration. If there is a limit on time it should be in handbook. If the School can\'t provide one, call administration office to get one. Or ask them about the time limit, get peoples names you talk to. I would also ask for a sensory diet be added to IEP. If they don\'t want to provide one, and it seems that your son needs one, call a IEP meeting to discuss this issue. Do you have an Autism Specialist that work for the School or that works with your child? If so, start with that person and tell them your concerns. If you request an IEP meeting and it is not granted , send a request for one in writing, make a copy for yourself and date it. Keep this as a paper trail. It sounds like they are not sure how to handle your request, but they should. Be nice but firm. To me it kinda sounds like they don\'t know a lot about Autism. You might want to seek an advocate so you are not the only one telling them what services your child is entitled to. I think you are doing a great job helping your child get what he needs from new School. Our School psych does not know a lot about Autism. The Autism team are the ones that tell Spec Ed Teacher what needs to be implemented in all classrooms, and does behavior plan and tells OT\'s about what kind of sensory diets are needed.'
'My son is in a regular kindergarten right now with his ABA therapist as his <br />shadow aide. His Kindergarten teacher has testified that at this time my <br />son does need hs aide. While he is smart and academically ahead, he has <br />trouble showing or talking about things that he does know. I was lucky <br />that although she is a district employee, her integrity as a teacher was <br />more important than what the SD wanted to do. <br /> <br />My son is not dependent on his aide, she is there to help him facilitate <br />transitions should he need it, keep him on task should he need it, be <br />reminded to sit still and be attentive. The list goes on. There is a number <br />of things that she does which are subtle but go a long way to help my son <br />learn from his teacher. The most important thing she does is to take data <br />on his day so we can adjust his home program to complement the <br />demands of kindergarten. We are taking data on a peer in the same class <br />as well. When the data looks about the same, that is when we will fade <br />out the shadow. <br /> <br />So next time they suggest that your child be placed in a typical <br />Kindergarten reply that you will need 1:1 ABA trained Aide to accompany <br />him to facilate his learning. You also will need an ABA home program to <br />help your child learn some more independent skill so your child will be <br />more sucessful in the school program. This way he can learn more skills <br />so he will not become dependent on the aide. <br /> <br />By the way, dont sign any IEP until you take it home and have a good look <br />at it. I would even have an advocate look at it. Just tell them at the <br />meeting that you need to really give it a lot of thought. My IEP team <br />leader is like a pit bull, any minute I think she is going to bite. Do I get <br />intimidated? Yes! You are not alone!

'That sounds very similiar to my what I did with my dd, however, she was never in special ed preschool. My dd has an October birthday, so I waited until she was turning six to start her in kindergarten. The only drawback I see now (she is in second grade) is she now realizes that she is older than everyone else in her class. Developmentally and socially she is still like 5-year-old, but she is very much aware that she is 8 and all of her classmates are 7. I can\'t say I would do anything different if I could, I just thought I\'d let you know she will probably become aware of the age difference eventually.'

'<P>Sunny, They should have introduced her. My daughter goes to a regular public school with a sp-ed preschool. She is transitioning into kindergarten (at age 4- I know..ridiculous) and they had A kindergarten teacher show up for her IEP..not so much that she will be her teacher, but as input for all the kindergarten teachers. They don\'t decide on teachers until they do testing on all the kindergartners and decide how they will divide up the classes.

'If your child is placed in a typicl preschool at YOUR expense, they do not have to follow the IEP at all. In kindergarten, the school HAS to. Anything done privately (unless it\'s at a private school paid for by the school, because then that\'s part of their contract) is entirely voluntary. It may not be possible to keep your child in preschool once she\'s of age to go to K unless you are willing to have her go without an IEP entirely. In order for a child with an IEP to stay in a preschool setting, that preschool must be certified as also a kindergarten. Otherwise, the school can insist that the child be transferred to the public school K if the parents want to continue the IEP at public expense. There may be individual state laws that say different, though, so check your local rules.'

What you need to do is put in a WRITTEN request for a full, multidisciplinary evaluation for a possible IEP. SEnd this to the Director of Special Education. They will meet with you and try to take you out of the evaluation, but INSIST. Then, they have 60 days from the date you sign consent to the date of an official meeting to determine if your child is eligible for an IEP. One person\'s \"observation\" cannot be the only thing they use to determine eligibilty. THey need to perform lots of standardized tests and then review them and, if you disagree with the results of the tests, you have the right to ask for Independent Educational Evaluations.

I don\'t think I would have been considered hyperlexic, since I was reading with comprehension and didn\'t have the other issues that go along with hyperlexia. <br><br>This is not what\'s going on with your son. They need to be addressing the fact that he doesn\'t know the names or sounds of most letters at age 5 1/2. Especially that he isn\'t able to identify the names of the letters yet.

'<P>Hello, I am so happy that I found tis wonderful resourceful group.<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"> I wanted to ask you guys, due to my financial distress, I am seeking to relocate to Palmdale. I currently live in Montclair, CA (Inland Empire Area) and well... I can no longer afford to stay here. Anyway, my son is 7yrs old and was diagnosed @ age 2 so we\'ve been through our bumpy roads and still more to come. He is in the mild-moderate autism spectrum, but he wasn\'t there until recently. He currently attends a private behavorial school funded through my district, and is doing fairly well, now we will be seeking for mainstreeming and inclusion (lets see how that goes <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley5.gif\" border=\"0\">). I also have another son that is not on the spectrum but is ADHD/ODD and he is also under an IEP and receiving services funded from the district.</P> <P>This leads me to my question: I need your advice on to what area is best for our kiddos? Do you know of schools that are ABA? Any info will help.

And, if that means hiring a speech therapist or reimbursing you for your expenses in speech therapy - don\'t they need to do that?</P> <P>And, if they don\'t have a social skills group - don\'t they need to create one if the need is there?

'<P>Proper eating habits should be on his IEP with at least the ONE goal of taking small bites and chewing. Of course, sending in food that is already cut up is a first step. The aide is not supposed to be like a surrogate mom. She is not there to cut up his food. If it needs to be cut up, it should be sent in cut up. I only say this because you may want to rethink other things if you\'ve been assuming the aide will do as your surrogate in school, which she may not be doing or even be allowed to do. If there is any confusion about her duties, I\'d ask for a written summary of what the aide\'s duties are. Just because she is not supposed to leave your son\'s side doesn\'t mean that she will do what you would normally do for him. Nor should she. If he has deficits, the IEP should be addressing them and she should be supporting him in gaining more independence and in achieving those goals. But not in doing things for him that he should be learning to do for himself (unless he is so far from that goal that the IEP states that she will help him in the interim). </P> <P>Of course, the one basic task of a one-on-one is to make certain the child is safe. My question is, where was SHE while he was choking? Is she trained in the Heimlich? Even waiters and waitresses are, so I would make certain that your son\'s aide is, too, given that he may have other choking incidents in the future. If a child does not yet know how to properly chew his food, that will always be an issue until he learns. Definitely get the OT involved and include that eating goal under the OT\'s responsibilities.</P>'
'It\'s late and I\'ll be brief, but I would document <span style=\"text-decorati&#111;n: underline;\">all</span> of this in writing and copy it to the principal and spec. ed. director. Insist that you will not accept one more day of your child being mistreated in this fashion and that you are happy to suggest alternatives if they are really that challenged in coming up with any. WTH do they think a child will learn by being treated this way?! Sorry, but it makes me really angry. <br><br>Here is my philosophy on interventions/strategies: If it\'s not something you would choose for yourself, don\'t do it to my child. In other words, positive strategies work, the rest don\'t. I really hope you get them to see the light because no one deserves that kind of ignorance. Btw, it sounds like he is really bright, does he really need this aide? Sounds like she is doing more harm than good. I\'d rather see your child\'s team come up with ways to support his teacher(s) than to put the wrong person around your son. Maybe she\'s the reason for his distracting behavior. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to beautiful 10-yr old twin girls,1 w/Autism, 1 NT(w/ speech delays to age 5)</div>'

'<P>Here in north Texas, entry to the schools is a crazy thing. There are two sets of doors, and you must check in with your drivers license and the secretary lets you into the next set of doors. Aside from a few days allowed eating with your child every year (they discourage too much of that), you have to be either an approved volunteer or have an appt. for a meeting. Rarely do they let parents past the double doors, usually having meetings or bringing the child to you instead of letting you go to the classroom. The autism classroom door has a narrow vertical window running along one side of the door on the top half, and half of that is obscured by stickers. </P> <P>I think that they will arrange for a parent to observe a class for a day if a written request is provided and approved, but I can\'t think that I would be witnessing an accurate representation of what actually goes on there on a normal day (when I am not there watching).</P>'

It effects the ability to infer other ppl\'s intentions and understand what other\'s need to know. Communication especially if it breaks down is tremendously difficult for kids with ASD.

Virtually all the children I\'ve had in 26 years wound up loving school. I would hate to think that I somehow damaged any of them. The kids always have an easier time of it than the parents do. I wouldn\'t tolerate teasing or bullying in my classroom and my students are never unsupervised. I am a little upset that someone would feel that \"many\" kids are damaged by their school experience or that \"most\" parents should educate their children at home. Schools were developed because parents weren\'t always able to do the job at home. Many home schooled kids do great and it\'s certainly an option but it takes tremendous commitment and sacrifice to teach your children at home. It\'s not something to be taken up casually or out of fear.

'If your child is not potty trained by school time, they MUST put potty training goals IN THE IEP. There is no guarantee that a child who is not potty trained can be placed in a mainstream class if the district can show why he cannot receive support in this goal in that sort of setting. For example, if the toilet is far from the classroom, training will be next to impossible in that setting. The IEP team MUSt explain why they are recommending a certain placement and they can\'t use just potty training issues as a way to exclude. But my guess is there may be other issues that make a mainstream placement not the least restrictive environment for YOUR child. Still, they have to put him in some sort of kindergarten and THEY have to make every effort to potty train him while he\'s in school and support your efforts at home.'

'Some of what you are asking about depends on your financial recourses. Many folks suggest that if you can, you do an evaluation first so that it is unbiased and your evaluator can do any tests he/she wants to. (Some tests cannot be repeated without waiting long enough that the student forgets the questions.) This sometimes called an independent educational evaluation (lower case letters). You pay for everything (or get your insurance to pay for it), but you can do it anytime you want.<br><br>A second choice is to try and use the law that if you disagree with a school district evaluation you can say so and the school district has to either agree to pay for a second opinion (of your choosing) or file for due process in court to defend their evaluation. In days past folks said that due process costs exceed evaluation costs so that the school districts would not file. That no longer seems to be the case locally (maybe the school district is now figuring in the costs of providing the services it was denying prior), and the school district tries to get parents to withdraw their request using a suitably threatening looking letter, which is not really among the legal options. So it could be very helpful to have some good reasons for finding the school evaluation inappropriate in case the school dsitrict files.<br><br>School districts are required to evaluate every three years, but can do so more often if they want or the parent asks in writing and follows a time line from asking to giving permission. It is likely that if you look in the procedural safeguards handout that they give you in the IEP meetings you will see a discussion about asking for an evaluation. Read it and in your next IEP meeting say something like \"I thought I read in this that I can ask for an evaluation. Could you explain this handout to me?\" (Tape the meeting if legal in your state.) Once the school district starts the evaluation you can take it from there.<br><br>Be aware that there seems to be a lot of gamesmanship about getting evaluations and IEEs since an evaluation can run upto $5000. It is helpful to have someone familar with your local laws and procedures.<br><br><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Dad2Luke&Alan on July 08 2009 at 1:08am</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it - U Sinclair  We choose to go to the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard - JFK</div>'

For the past 6 mos or so, she\'s able to sit in regular chairs. I\'d be extremely opposed to her being placed in such a seat in the classroom (for therapy, sometimes it is helpful, as they are comfy &amp; they have a table for fine motor skills, language activities, etc. IF the child is okay with them, smaller children may feel better in such a seat).<br><br>In our classroom, they have these neat plastic square chairs, all the kids can sit in them (very kid friendly).

'<P>Well...we dropped him off this morning and it really was quite pleasant. The oldest child in the class is 6 years old so that\'s not bad. We came in the room and he was so excited! He was there once before for the IEP meeting (it was held in his class) so he was familiar with it. He ran right for the kids first and said \"HI...I\'m Adam\". THen he ran and went to play with toys he seen on the shelf. The teacher then told us that after a couple of weeks of him getting used to this class they will have to do something for his social other than this particular classroom. SHe mentioned him going to the special ed pre-K room for half a day so that he can be around more social children and then doing the rest of the day in her class. She said that this will be necessary due to the fact that all the children in the class are pretty much non-verbal except one and this one particular child\'s language is not as well developed as Adams. There were a lot of aids in there with the teacher. I told him goodbye and i would be back later to get him. He cried but not like meltdown cry so that is good. I\'m sitting here and I really don\'t know what to do with myself..LOL Big Adam and I decided that we are going about 15 mins early when we pick him up and we are going to peek in the window at him to see how he is doing..LOL Anyway...I will update when I get him back home. </P> <P>Karrie</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to Billy 15 (adhd) Lisa 13 NT Adam 6 (Pdd-nos) Addison (2) Aiden (9 months)</div>'

'<P>We live in a large schooldisrict which has staggered school times so busses pick up and drop off at three schools in a row. Since kids in special ed programs are most often not in their homeschool the routing is one big complicated puzzle. Knowing that extra busses and drivers are really expensive and that funding would come out of classroom resource I understand the problem. But my ds gets picked up 15-20 minutes early from his class every day so the bus can leave early and make it to the next school. That adds up to a week+ of missed instruction every year. My friends son gets dopped off 25 minutes late every day! Really?!</P> <P>If I dropped my kid of late every day I\'d sure hear about it from the school.

'<P><FONT size=2>No child in this district or any district should be refused a special education becasue others are and the school district is having to spend money on them. Out of district or not. The only way your child can be refused a special education is if they do not meet IDEA guidelines in your state for having a disability. Just because the current school district might have to provide thousands of dollars in his edcuation doesn\'t mean that any other child can be denied services on the basis of money. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>Also, I am not sure if I agree with the poster who commented that it is the responsibility of the zoned school to provide services. And that the zone school should be the one to provide services. While this is true to a point, it is confusing the way it is stated. For example, the zoned school does have to provide an appropriate education to the child and family without the parent having to eat the cost of it. According to what I am understanding the district decided the best placement for you son is this current school. This current school took your son and the zoned school has to eat the cost of that. So in some sense, the zoned school is responsible. But when the chosen school takes your son in to educate them, they have to follow the rules and laws Of IDEA. I hope that makes sense, I think I confused myself. lol</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>Anyway, I agree with Tzoya, get some help on this one. Especially if it\'s a loop hole.

The only person suspension punishes is Tom who will spend the day keeping him off video games and entertaining him instead of him getting in actual trouble. Like in school suspension. We discussed it at every meeting since he broke that statue and they threatened suspension. But Tom didn\'t listen, said \"ok\" and then didn\'t TELL me because he didn\'t want to upset me since I\"m not feeling well. Great. So tell me at 4:15pm when I can\'t DO anything because they\'re all gone and I can obsess and be upset all weekend. Thats smart.<br><br>Yes, the kid needs consequences.

'Extended school year is for kids who would have significant regression over the summer w/o services.

'<P>Least Restrictive Environment, in laymens terms, is simply the least restrictive environment in which the child can make progress.</P> <P>Without considering the child, just in general, enviornments from least to most restrictive would be:</P> <P>- Mainstream (no supports)</P> <P>- Mainstream (with in class support / pullouts)</P> <P>- Self-Contained (with mainstream for some classes/actvities)</P> <P>- Self-Contained (no interaction with mainstream at all)</P> <P>So what the team has to ask themselves, would this particular child make expected progress in mainstream with no supports? If the answer is no, than would this child make expected progress in mainstream with in class support / pullouts? If no, go on down the list.

At the annual review, we determined that he was not making expected progress, so this year he is in a Self-Contained class with mainstream for art, music, pe, library, computers, lunch &amp; recess.

Once the educational eval comes back, if it says they don\'t agree with your doctor\'s eval, ask them through a certified letter to pay for an Independent Educational Evaluation. They MUST pay for one or take you to a hearing. They CANNOT simply say no. Remind them of this if they try to say no. Then ask for a \"stay put\" pending the results of the IEE. That means your daughter stays put in her current placement until an IEP meeting is convened to go over the new doctor\'s results. Call the Autism Society for a recommendation of a child psychiatrist or a neuropsychologist they would recommmend. It HAS to be someone who is an expert in Autism.

Today she was trying to talk me into just doing 1 half day session instead of the two. Their loop hole out of the ABA is that everyone on the team agreed he no longer needs discreet trials. I actually agree with them. That said, I told the director what I am looking for is a person with him to encourage appropriate interactions with his peers. Use ABA techniques within his day with his interactions. This is a task that isn\'t feasible for the current teacher and aide in my opinion.

The school on the other hand insisted that the zoloft was causing him suidial thoughts and bad behaviors. The school pycoloist and nurse insisted that I take him off the zoloft and I refused. Their conclusion was that his issues was caused by \"Poor Parenting Skills\".<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley7.gif\" border=\"0\"> so since January they have called Kyles doctor and everything to try and get me to take him off the zoloft and I still refused and the doctor backed my up on it.

'<P>Certainly the District can ignore regulations and laws if they believe they have more money than the parents do for attorneys. They are correct. However, you have low/no cost options at your disposal - mainly State Complaints and Mediation Sessions. I am not saying that these Due Process procedures are going to help you prevail, legally, against the District but I am saying that these things can cost the district and district personnel plenty in time and even money, so use them. No Sped Head wants to spend his/her summer having the state ed auditors investigating your allegations. So negotiate behind the scenes with the district admins and then use these techniques to, basically, harass them into compliance. Of course, the BEST way to get what you need for your child is to maintain cordial relations and NOT use Due Process procedures. Becoming Parent Non Grata is deadly. But if you (or others) already find themselves in that position, you have nothing to lose Remember, KEEP EXCELLENT PAPER TRAILS. Best of luck.</P> <P>Btw, if you have the statement of not performing evals due to money (or any other reason) on tape or in writing, that is a HUGE no-no. It means the District is robbing parents of their most essential IDEA right - full participation. Decisions that are not made individually are presumed to shut out parents, which is Commandment #1 - parents have the right and duty to FULL PARTICIPATION.</P>'

'Interventions are designed to help bring a child from a point of deficit to a point of catching up. IF he didn\'t have deficits, he wouldn\'t need to catch up. So, yes, looking at those miserable numbers is hard, but that is WHY he\'s getting an IEP. YOung kids do make fast progress in many cases. I always found it helpful, when DS was little, to continually bring him into social situations with kids exactly his age - Gymboree, McDonald\'s, playgrounds, birthday parties, Sunday school, team sports, etc. Not only was learning to socialize imperative for him, it kept me real about where his development stood compared to NT kids his exact age. By doing that, I didn\'t need a test score to tell me my son still needed help. I could never fool myself into thinking things were fine. IF that happened, it would have gypped my son of needed interventions. I found it always far better to stare reality in the face.'

'I like to thinks it\'s an advantage. I teach SDC and will have 5 kiddos with autism next year. I think dealing with autism at home helps me be more tolerant and understanding at school. I also can identify with the parents a lot. I think the parents appreciate that I know what it\'s like to live with autism day in and day out. My dd is older than my students so I also have the advantage of \"having been there and done that\" with my child and know what to expect with my students. <br><br>One of our psychologist took my picture at the end of last school year and took it to a student that will be in my class next year to help him transition to my class. I ran into him yesterday at the museum and he seemed to recognize me from the picture. (I knew it was him because I recognized mom from an IEP meeting). Anyway, maybe you can contact someone from the district and see if they know who the aide will be and see if you can get a picture for your son.<br>'

'<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\">okay here\'s my story with brady\'s school system, he\'s 5 yr. old kindergardner at a small school close to home, he was recently dx pdd-nos, adhd, odd. with severe sensory issues. Before he entered kind, i went to the school and talked with them about brady so they know what to expect, at the time I didn\'t have a dx but was working on a offical one before they could test him for sp. education. Well the first day of school he was sitting in the prin. office having a meltdown and they immediately called me in that this kind of behavior was not acceptable. Well I called my mother crying and we went in the prin. office and there he was in a corner drying up his tears and i looked around at people whom i never met. It ended up being the sp. ed. director, sped teacher, his teacher, prin., and sp. teacher. They was wanting to know what all kind of dr.s has he been going to and I told them, and all i was waiting on was he cl. phycholgist to write out a letter about him for the school and I. They went on to say that i need a sec. opin before they can accept him in sp. ed because for one they said they\'ve heard of his phych. dx alot of children with autism which was actually fine. So being me after hearing them (so called educationalist) I listened to them and they actually had me convinced that he don\'t have these disorders maybe just adhd. But in the meantime while i get a sec. opinion they\'ll serv. brady with an aide to help him until sec. dx. So in the meantime, being not educated about asd i started researching while waiting on next dr.s appt.They kept telling me that he\'s to smart and socialable to have these dxs. that maybe he\'s just dd and adhd instead with mod. sp/lang impairments. (And keep in mind this is still his label after a yr of kind. even though they all know he\'s autistic, and after me requesting his label changed they still putting it off until he\'s 8) But back to the beginning, i got the sec. dx about the 2nd month he was in kind. and we had another iep meeting and i had all the requests from dr.s and I. and they said he\'s doing so much better that we can scratch the full time assist., and that he will only go in the sped rm only while undesirable behavior accurs because he\'s kind. teacher says he does fine now as long as she\'s sturn. Ok so i agreed (bad mistake) they agreed on bring in ot for him 1x a wk n sp/lang 3x. But will not do pt because it was not interfering in academics. Ok i agreed (bad mistake) well after a yr of dr.s appts, teacher conf. going back and forth to the school about Brady having iep after iep for other requests like behavior therapist,pt again, and now esy, i have learned so much researching here, reading books, really observing Brady, and just learning on asd and wrights law i have really grown to know that i\'ve got a long battle ahead of me and it\'s so overwhelming. School is out now and i\'m trying to get brady on a schedule at home now and i just one my first school battle!<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley32.gif\" border=\"0\"><IMG src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\">During our first yr. of kind we had battles. it took 4 wks then a call to the superintendant before brady got OT, sp/lang was set in iep also 3 x a wk well brady rarely went. and still no behavior therapist. I knew the esy meeting was coming up soon so i started researching more and preparing for the last iep meeting and i won as far as brady cont. OT services through the summer we decided to hold brady back in kind. due to his immaturaty, and his lack in understanding phonics and math. I won on bringing in the assistant back during transitioning times, and i won on brady having more time in sped rm to give him a break and to work on the skills he\'s behind in. I won on the teachers whom are around Brady to get educated on asd over summer I was so happy!! BUT!! I also lost in the meeting about Brady\'s esy! His sp/lang teacher said that she feels like he will not regress during summer! I was very puzzled! My son cannot even carry a conversation, talks on topics, has echolia, and is sometimes hard for me to understand and she\'s telling me my son don\'t need speech??????? well after me doing alot of thinking and talking to others I fin. called a advocate. I\'m taking Brady myself on outpatient sp/ and ot therapy 1x wk. The school is paying for 1 more ot this summer, instead of a behavior therapist coming to the school there sending us this summer to the clinic which is good but i still feel like they should come in next yr to observe him in the school setting to see if any accomadations should be made. Back to the speech for summer i won!!! After talking to the advocate I found out that all the times he did not go to speech while in school that the school owes this to him rather it be summer or next fall. as well as ot. I was mad and glad at the same time. The school finally accepted my requests to pay for him to go 2 speech therapy during the summer because I got educated!! I feel so good not only winning but for the fact I\'ve helped my son!! Brady has very limited speech and when your not only asd and sens. impairments there behavior is so much worse with the hitting and biting and not knowing what to do. so I\'m so glad he\'s going to get to go more for sp therapy and ot because this helps him so much where he don\'t have to use this undesirable behavior. He\'s came a long way this past yr. but i\'ve noticed his stems n tics or getting worse, and wondering about changing meds. I\'m still fighting on the PT but with the help of everyone I hope to win that one next. Any advice would be appreciated!! I\'m not giving up on my little guy i\'m learning just as well as he is. It\'s really overwhelming seeing him go through hard times and knowing its up to me to get him all the help he needs and i\'m not never giving up! Watch out school system I know more than what u think I know for this coming fall! I\'m learning as I go too!! GOD BLESS!

'<P>FIrst of all, you have until Feb. 12th to keep all the unfinished assignments. Frankly, you are currently rewarding the teacher by doing her work for her in helping your son complete assignments at home. IF you STILL want to do that, make a Xerox copy of the unfinished work (or scan it into your computer and print it out if your printer doesn\'t have a copy feature) and have him complete the XEROX. Keep the originals.</P> <P>The issue is not the aide/no aide thing. It\'s HOW does the school propose to support him in completing his assignments. I HAVE to agree with Wray that a one-on-one is the fastest way to make a child DEPENDENT as opposed to independent (as me how I know). What you REALLY want to know is how the school proposes to address the issue of missed classwork. It may be that he needs an accommodation that says he finishes only half his work (certain kids work well but work at too slow a pace due to processing issues to complete as many items as NT kids can. And, franky, 10 multiplication problems per session will teach him as much as 25). Or it could be that he needs to have his work broken up for him...that seeing ALL that work at once on a page is overwhelming. Or perhaps he\'s being distracted. Does he sit near a window and ends up getting distracted by what\'s outside, for example? A positive behavior intervention plan could work very well here, rewarding him for his pace of work. I\'d get a Functional Behavioral Assessment done to find out WHY his work is not being completed. Having a one-on-one aide will teach him NOTHING good. It will only teach him that someone else will manage his time and be in charge of his world. Even at this tender age, kids need to learn that THEY are responsible. Also, a lot of the benefits of being included will fall away if he gets a one-on-one. Of course, your concerns are totally valid. Do you have standardized testing on your son for his academic abilities? Grades are meaningless. Get them to translate his abilities into percentiles. If his percentiles are below the 25th percentile, he is NOT at grade level, not matter what his grades say. In that case, the school has to hustle to get him caught up because NCLB and IDEA 2004 state that ALL children will reach the goals for NT kids their own age. Obviously, this won\'t happen with some kids, but the school are not left off the hook. They MUST try to bring EVERY child up to grade level, EVERY year. This is a huge change from the pre-NCLB law and gives much more power to parents to demand that their child meet all the grade level standards. The trick is to get VALID, standardized testing on your child to prove where he lands, achievement wise. Do NOT depend on the word of the teacher or anyone else. \"show me the standardized scores\" is, in the spec. ed. world, the equivalent of \"show me the money.\"</P> <P>So, keep all the unfinished classwork sent home between now and the 12th. Present it at the meeting and ask \"What are we going to do about this?\" Let them make some proposals and then make some counter proposals. I would avoid the one-on-one if there is ANY other possible solution. I\'ve also found that the main classroom teachers tend to ignore kids with one-on-ones and then the child ends up being educated by the aide, who is most certainly NOT a \"highly qualified teacher.\" My son has always had a one-on-one, so I KNOW all the drawbacks.</P>'

I mean, who has the power?

That is compared to 3:40-3:45!!!<br>HUGE difference!<br>I have NO idea what she said to the bus company, but it was different than what Malachi\'s teacher must have said though she called twice, I called three times and the principle had called as well!<br><br>So Praise God! he\'s only riding for 2 minutes and he\'s never on their alone, just with a couple other classmates who I think he knows all of. They are all just little peanuts 3-6 years old. <br><br>Also the sub driver that was creeping me out was finally gone &amp; his regular driver back so that helped as well.<br><br>I still didn\'t get the whole skinny on the details, but according to the parent advocate that I talked to the school is legally responsible to give your child the education he needs/deserves ,and if something is getting in the way of that, like something they are not providing etc, they need to find a way for you to get that (which is in your rights) and according to what this woman looked up, legally they might have to even pay for your child to go to a different school , or even get them a in home tutor of some sort if they aren\'t providing what the child needs.<br>Therfore, if the bus can\'t get him to school, they ARE responsible for that (contrary to what the bus co. and principle lead me to believe)<br>interesting..........<br>point is- keep pushing!!!! we have more rights than we know! <br>sad...sad that the schools (&amp; other) would rather keep you in the dark than accomidate everyone.<br><br><br>VICTORY!<img src=\"smileys/smiley32.gif\" border=\"0\"> <br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- mom to Malachi 5 years old (Autistic dx) and Ivan 2+ (NT)</div>'

'<P>The truth is that Hearing Officers will base a decision on whether or not the \"offense\" has a negative affect on the child - you are correct in this. But if it can be shown that the wrong classification has been detrimental, the officer WILL require the change. In NY (where I live) there is an exception to the \"classification does not drive the services\" rule. In NY, children who have the classification of \"autism\" get certain services by regulation. For example, if a child is labeled under \"autism,\" s/he is <U>guaranteed </U>DAILY speech/language therapy. Also, if the child with an autism classification is not placed in a class especially for the autistic, s/he has the right to the services of a professional who has come to be known (colloquially) as an \"autism consultant.\" There are other guarantees, but these are the ones parents are most interested in. Also, a Hearing Officer might order the classification changed if there has erroneously been no Manifestation found due to the misclassification. Each case is different. And each state is different.</P> <P>If your daughter\'s IEP would not change if here classification were \"autism,\" why do you think it should be changed? </P>'

'Our daughter has PDD/NOS and several other disorders. She is 15 yrs old and we currently live in SW Florida. There are no services here, both in school and out. They have a waiting list for the medicaid waiver that is now 9 yrs. long and the State of Florida has cut funding to people with disabilities. I guess that they feel retirees and vacationers are more important than the people who actually live here full time. We were considering relocation to North Carolina (we heard that they may have more services), but I just got an email today from the Autism Society of North Carolina telling us that there is no funding for services or group homes. The only program that seems to be offered is TEACCH, but that is only for school age children. We are concerned about what happens after school ends? What sort of life will our child have? Are there any assisted work programs for people with developmental delays? Are there any group homes? If so, where are they located and are they safe? We really want our daughter to be able to be as independent as possible and just don\'t know where to turn. We would really hate to move back up North because of the bad winters, but if we knew of a place that could help, we would consider it. Any suggestions would be wonderful - we are desperate.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- newagemom</div>'

'<P>I wanted to add that I apologize if the above is sounding like I\'m either in denial or somehow angry that someone would dare suggest my dd has autism. When my ds\' pre-school teacher suggested that he might have Asperger\'s - I did not react this way. I kind of suspected and then when she said it - I ran with it and never looked back. We started private services immediately and went through all the eval stuff. I just don\'t see it with my dd.</P> <P>I want to also apologize to anyone if they are offended by this post. I don\'t want to minimize anyone\'s feelings or trials and challenges that you are going through with your kids. I go through them with my ds all the time as well. This is minor compared to that, I understand. And I probably wouldn\'t be so angry if this teacher didn\'t seem like she wanted my dd out of the program. She told me at the beginning of the year that if my dd had autism that she would probably be better suited for another program. That is when I told her she had been evaluated previously and we were told she did NOT have autism. It seems that telling this teacher the info about my son and that we had had dd evaluated - she just seems to not want her in the program. I have asked if she is a big behavior problem in the classroom - not at all. She has her moments, but no more than any other child. Maybe even less. The other teachers say they really enjoy having her in class. Several parents have approached me for playdates because their child wants to have one with my dd. My dd has friends in this class and she would really miss it if we changed schools. I just don\'t like feeling like my dd isn\'t wanted by the lead teacher. <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"></P> <P>Again, sorry for the length.

'<P>FIrst of all, anything that is not in writing on the IFSP, Colin or you don\'t get. That includes written communication from the teacher. At the next meeting, insist that daily written communication between home and school be included in his IFSP. You can create a form to send in every day with the questions you want answered on it. Make it as easy as possible for the teacher. For example, ask how many times Colin was taken to the bathroom. Put 1,2, 3, 4 on the form so the teacher can circle the right answer. Ask how many times he performed on the potty 1,2, 3, 4. Ask how many minutes he sat in circle time (fill in the blank). Or any number of other questions you regularly have. Ask that the teacher enter any other comments on the back of the sheet. Date these sheets and keep them in a chronological file. If one comes home blank or does not come home at all, put a blank sheet in the file and date it. That way, you also have a record of how compliant the teacher has been. </P> <P>About the autism consultant - can he or she perform and FBA and come up with a BIP for your son? Call this consultant today to ask about the observation. The real truth is that you will have to learn to do all of this supervisory work with ANY school your child goes to. It is still early in the year and there HAS to be a shake-down period. If, after another week or so, there still is little coming back to you that you recognize as typical of your son, call a team meeting and discuss all your issues. Also, if there are goals you don\'t think Colin has achieved which they claim he has, try the exercise at home with him while your husband videotapes them attempt. Keep an ongoing video log of all that concerns you at home. If he doesn\'t show these things at school, ask them to provide you with parent training so that COlin\'s school skills can be tranferred to the home environment. </P>'

'Hi Kristi - I\'m a first time poster, but a parent of an eight year old son with autism and a \"typical\" 14 year old daughter. Since I had been very protective of my eldest daughter - she didn\'t even go to preschool til 4 years of age and even then I stayed with her half the time - I could envision leaving my son who couldn\'t communicate at age TWO. But then I got to know this very special breed of humans called special educators - people who love our kids in spite of and because of their issues. I have never seen such compassion, dedication and energy. I stayed in the school lobby for about a week - he would come out and check on me occasionally - but I eventually was able to leave - confident that he was with people far better equipped to help him than I. But I must add that this was a highly regarded school for autism and speech disorders that specialized in ABA. Being able to sit for two, five, ten, fifteen minutes at a time is usually one of the first objectives and ABA is the old stand by approach that seems to work on this. These teachers will know what to do. Find a place that has a good reputation and then have faith. Southern California has a great track record on good schools. Good Luck! We\'re all behind you!'

I will always be glad that I made this decision and they agreed. He was the youngest in his classroom (a late Nov.birth) and he was already immature for hie age. So one more year in KG (which he did not even understand when it happeneed), helped reinforce the basics and also helped him mature. Nowhe is just a few months older than the older ones in his class and few months dont count at all looking at a lifetime, and the strong foothold retention gave him I strongly beleieve.

'I did not mean to imply in my post that the boy\'s parents do not care <br />about education or their kid.

'Our experience: About an hour to cover 5 miles. The bus was so late in getting to school that the school began to call us to see where son was. First time we freaked out. I hike, so I put my smallest GPS unit into his backpack to see what was happening. We went through a lot of batteries since I could not turn it off until the end of the day when I got home.<br><br>As far as I could tell from the tracks, the bus would stop places and wait 5-15 minutes before proceeding. If every kid needed to be picked up (and it only seemed like it was 5 or so kids) the bus took a bit more than an hour and most of the time it was not moving. It also seemed that if some kids early in the route were not being picked up, the bus just sat someplace so it would not be too early at the later stops. I had one track where my son must have been the only one on the bus and they drove on the freeway and were home in 5 minutes.<br><br>We did not see any way to improve things given the realities of how the bus must operate.

You can then talk with him about what he thinks his new teacher should know about him. I have always written letters to the teachers at the beginning of the year.

Second one didnt think anything was wrong with dd only she said she has great language and only needs to work on answering questions that she will be asked in preschool. Yeah ok dd does label all the flash cards she did with her but other than that and her talking about only what she wants to talk about and almost 1/2 of that I still cant understand she cant not tell you what she wants or needs, 1/2 of her day is spent quiet on the couch with her blanket and bottle and only says something when she needs a refill on her bottle or sippy cup of juice and when she does talk it usually isnt towards anyone its usually her just chatting. When she is hungry she knows a few food words but these are not always what she wants. The therapists only concern was getting to answer how old are you, whats you name and teaching her the word NO which OMG is driving me insane now bc everything you ask her is NO even if she means yes and can understand why you dont know what she means by it. So right now we are without a speech therapist and I think I have done more work myself if finding what will work with her than either of these therapist have tried to do.

I honestly think it is the reason he is doing so well this year. Now, I should add he was hyper-verbal and if your child is not very verbal it might not be the best choice. His issues are mainly social and having kids who did not require him to carry on a lengthy conversation helped him really progress in terms of play skills.

It gave my son the courage to try to play with other kids with little risk of getting rejected or teased. </P> <P>However, for a child with moderate autism I don\'t know that it would be a good placement. I used to work at Head Start and they didn\'t have any training on autism at all at that time. I am guessing that has changed to SOME extent, but not much. We made sure his teacher had some experience (it helped that I had worked there and knew the staff). At our Head Start, we did have one-on-ones that we could pull in if we had a child that needed it.

'We currently live in NC and have a five year old. Our family is considering moving to TX or some other state that has a school that would assist my son next year for kindegarten. His speech and language is delayed along with social skills. Does anyone know of any good schools? NC is defintely not a state that has any interest ( my experience) in helping children with special needs. All it is concerned about is saving money and being able to qualify for federal money.'
'<font size=\"2\">I had a long thread on inclusion vs sped for preschoolers a while ago.<br>I was in this huge dilemma about sending my son to a special day<br>class vs a regular preschool (where he did fine, except did not interact<br>as much as we wanted). Anyway, I did opt for the special day class,<br>a new one the SD is starting, with an SLP as a teacher. I was excited.<br>Fast Forward to Sept. My son made tremendous gains in language and<br>social skills in 4 months since that decision. The class started with <br>4 kids (including my son), 2 of them are non-English speakers and the<br>third is not very verbal. Teacher said my son is a great role model in<br>the class. Well, what about his role models? The SD has \"plans\" to <br>incorporate some typical kids (Kinders) but no guarantees. So, to get<br>some typical peer interaction I enrolled my son into a day care next<br>door to the school. He goes there 9am-12pm and then goes to his<br>special day class, forgoing a nap. The day care is big, 25+ kids<br>and it is all free play, in a noisy environment. My son is actually<br>interacting with kids much more than before, initiates and holds<br>some conversation during lunch and other activities, but I think he<br>doesn\'t do a whole lot in the 3 hours except play with cars with a few<br>kids who also likes cars. He is also exhausted by the time he gets to<br>his special day class. <br><br>So, here I am again, thinking : <br>a) Is the special day class with no peers at his level the LRE for him?<br>He does benefit from it and likes it ( he is the star, so of course), but<br>how does it help his language growth since there are no peers at or<br>higher than his level?<br><br>b)Is it better to give him help to generalize his skills in a mainstream<br>environment since he seems ready for it?<br><br>I know that kids on the spectrum are all different, and some people<br>say ASD kids do not learn from peers unless someone drills them,<br>but my son does seem to learn from peers, according to my <br>observation of his interaction with typical peers. He has trouble <br>playing with children in a big group. <br><br>Anyway, would like to hear any advice and what other parents and<br>teachers think about the importance of role models and typical peer<br>interaction. <br><br>Thanks!<br></font>'

'<SPAN =bold>tzoya, the problem is that my state does not have regulations regarding seclusions in schools, only in a psychiatric/hospital setting. Schools aren\'t required to abide by those restrictions. This is the premise of the legal action the advocacy attorney is pursuing. He wants to establish laws/regulations for all schools in my state. Until now, nobody has come across something as severe as this, so there\'s never had to be an official ruling. The attorney said this case is very unique, but it raises a lot of concerns with the lack of laws and regulations. Most schools use real rooms for seclusions and they don\'t abuse other aspects such as length of time a child is kept in there and other such things. </SPAN>'

'I am a teacher and have used Everyday Math for years. I\'ve taught Kindergarten, first and second grade.<br>I have to tell you that Everyday Math can be difficult for children with learning disabilites. At many schools, children with lower cognitive scores (below 80) and processing difficulties use an alternate program.<br>My son who is 6 and in a school that uses Everyday Math (and many, many schools do) is fine. He is a smart boy and the games part of it is phenomenal for his social skill goals. Everyday Math is really a fantastic math program, the best one I\'ve seen, and I\'ve been teaching for 2 decades. The results are outstanding and I have to tell you that these kids are doing math that you would not believe. I mean my 2nd grader already understands multiplication and division even though she doesn\'t know all of the facts. My first grade students are doing pre-algebra. This is where our country lags behind other countries so it is great to have this resource. All of my students ( and I have one on the spectrum) are excelling with this curriculum.<br>The tricky thing is that it teaches something and that may not be what you practice with paper and pencil. Also, it introduces items that are not a secure goal until the end of the year or even the following year. For some kids, that can be difficult b/c they don\'t practice something until mastery. I think that probably benefits my son b/c if he doesn\'t get it, it is ok. I think the \"spiral\" is an ingenous idea and I know many educators are doing spirals in other curricula areas now b/c of the results.<br>So go in with an open mind and see if it will work for your child. If he is smart, as many as our kiddos are, it may be fine. But I think the school needs to have a basic skill math program as a back up for kids that cannot handle the challenge of this program.<br>Cecelia<br>'
'<P>Hi, like I said, I spoke with the State\'s Attorney and she is working on having the district that he attends preschool potentially be responsible for his speech and OT. No case was ever won against our local home distrist and they do not outsource any services, meaning he\'d have to attend their preschool and I can\'t bear to put him through that again. Hopefully the locale of his preschool will actually help us.</P> <P>Money of course is an issue. Our insurance covers nothing and we pay for Private Preschool out of pocket and wrack up the bills for speech and OT</P> <P>I guess my question was really do I consult a behaviorist regarding the issues brought up from his teacher because I have no experience with this and sometimes I get caught up in the advocacy fight (countless letters, calls, complaints to my insurance and also countless letters to the State Dept of SpEd and attorneys) and forget that I need to concentrate on my son\'s needs NOW in order to progress later. </P> <P>We plan to move from our district, sadly.</P>'

'Having just gone through this and every school district is different, the <br />assessment meeting was to assess my child and in my SD it was actually <br />two meetings about an hour each, with a ST, OT, teacher, nurse, <br />psychologist, and PE teacher present. Plus I had many forms to fill out in <br />between meetings- around 20 pages of questions about my child. After <br />the assessment, we all met again to go over their reports and at that <br />point I added a few concerns and stated my agreements and <br />disagreements with their reports. With the info from these reports and <br />my knowledge of my child, I made a list of things that needed to be <br />addressed in my child\'s IEP. I brought this list with me to the IEP meeting <br />and whatever was on my list that was not addressed in the meeting, I <br />brought it up. <br /> <br />I am just thinking that perhaps many of the things you are presently <br />concerned about they will already ask you about or observe in you child <br />during the assessment. They should also be obtaining reports from any <br />speech therapists, OTs and teachers your child currently has plus hearing <br />tests and vision tests results if you have them. I also gave them copies of <br />his diagnostic reports for autism when I got them from the hospital. <br /> <br />It can\'t hurt to have a list of concerns at the assessment, in case they do a <br />brief assessment but in my case the SD gave a pretty good assessment of <br />my child in many different areas.<span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by momtowill on November 13 2006 at 10:49pm</span>'

'OK - we\'re done with our meeting. He qualified for a program for fall placement(which means he is in a program for at least the next 2 school years). He will be in a blended setting (NT kids and kids who have IEPs for various reasons). There will be an early childhood teacher, special ed early childhood teacher and an aide. 20 kids per class (6 or 7 with IEPs and the rest NT). He will get 1 hr speech therapy a week, 30 minutes OT per week and 30 minutes with social worker per month. We do not know what school he will be going to yet, though he will qualify for transporation services if need be. They have to send him to the closest school with an opening.

Doesn\'t understand you just can\'t do that. Then begrudgingly he changed his clothes. Oh yeah but first he had to throw a fit and throw the alarm clock on the floor. See he was trying to stay home so he too could come with me to Jeffrey\'s school meeting. As Gabe was getting on the bus he told me \"I don\'t like you!!!\" Fine, not suppose to like the parent all the time. At least he got on the bus.

Well first off the bus driver said the bus aide quit. Okay so here we go again. Jeffrey says \"no bus aid? Man I can\'t ride the bus then.\" I also noticed he is not the last one picked up. Now I did notice on his ride to school you do pass all of his favorite landmarks. So that was nice, lol.</FONT></strong></P> <P><strong><FONT color=#003399>So I get to his school and he can be so shy when greeting strangers. Quite cute actually. He bows his head and is grinning from ear to ear and says hi. Before the meeting officially started we talked about the transportation issue again. The social worker said she emailed someone in transportation and they might switch him to a different bus. </FONT></strong></P> <P><strong><FONT color=#003399>First off we have to start doing the transition paperwork since he is almost, gasp, 14. Wow they grow up so fast. That has to be done by his birthday. He is mainstreamed in reading, social studies, and science. They started mainstreaming him for science this year. He is scoring in the middle for reading compared to nt kids. Which is pretty good for his class. His reading teacher said he is the most polite student in his class and that includes nt kids. So great points for politeness, which Jeffrey is really great at. They are starting him on a computer reading program, which he seems to like. And his reading has improved. In the winter they will introduce him to a typing program, which he shows an interest in doing at home. They are testing him on reading with the NALT test. He seems to have problems with reading comprehension. I suggested that we see if it is more of a short term memory thing and have him read something today and ask him questions on it tomorrow.</FONT></strong></P> <P><strong><FONT color=#003399>His math is too inconsistent at this point, along with the telling time. He still has issues with the counting of money. He can count it out if using dimes but once you add quarters it confuses him. They do a coffee cart at school where they go around asking people if they want coffee, hot chocolate or tea. And they give the change out. Which he loves doing.</FONT></strong></P> <P><strong><FONT color=#003399>His speech is increased on one to one to 60 minutes a week, which is max allowed by state law. Had to correct the speech therapist on one thing she said. She suggested that when it comes to his landmarks just tell him he won\'t see them today. I wish!!! I told her that I disagreed with her, that that is part of the ocd type behaviours. I did suggest that very clear language be put in the IEP in regards to the ocd type behaviours. Like when you see him going from subject to subject, that is the trigger that the ocd type behaviour is increasing. He is getting agitated. On the weighted blanket his teacher has said he has never asked for it even when she offered it.</FONT></strong></P> <P><strong><FONT color=#003399>Summer school was briefly discussed. His advocate from ARC was there and she asked if summer school was held at his current school. And she was basically told the district holds it where the district sees fit to save money. But in Jeffrey\'s case we could have him have his summer school sessions at a different place like the park or the library. Now if Jeffrey has any say on it, you know where he will have it at. The University of Minnesota. </FONT></strong></P> <P><strong><FONT color=#003399>Next fall is his time for his three year review but we will do it in the spring since we don\'t know if he will have some of the same teachers next fall or not.

'I think school staff need education on all disorders and the symptoms. Some think everything is adhd or add.'
'<P>Tammy - make a list of all that is happening in school that YOU know of. And ask the teacher to make a similar list of \"complaints.\" Definitely get the behavioral specialist in. Also, request a visit to view the self-contained class. While all the adults in Bailey\'s life are getting their acts together about this behavior thing, Bailey is suffering. It seems quite clear to me that the teachers/staff in his current class are incompetent when it comes to autism. If there cannot be an autism consultant who comes in regularly to give them constant recommendations, I think Bailey will lose this year. When my son was in elementary school, we had the autism consultant come in once a week, every week. She tried to see him at various times of day and with every adult who was in his life. She made all kinds of recommendations and was a terrific resource for the teachers (there usually was a different consultant each year, which had its cons but also its pros). She also came to our home and gave me direct parent training a couple of times a month. Speak to a spec. ed. advocate to see if this sort of service is available in your area (the school is not going to let on because it costs them bigtime - but an advocate will know if this sort of services exists in your area). </P> <P>IMHO, the school is using a spoon to bail out a flood. It doesn\'t seem to me, based on all your posts, that anyone is really trying to keep Bailey\'s best interests at the forefront. If he were my son, I\'d look to other placements.</P>'
'<P>Personally, I have seen them all come into play together. The OT has helped Taylor with writing, mostly. Because she couldn\'t grip a pencil or crayon correctly, they devices a special type of \"brace\", usiing..not kidding, a hair tie.

She used to talk and sing, but regressed. But, they taught her to communicate through pecs..and now, in 5th grade she is on an electronic speaking machine that talks in full sentences. She can communicate quite well with this. </P> <P>In may area back home at that age, special instruction was simply, play and learn. It involved things like, shape devices, letter devices..playskool type of toys that were for learning. It was fun for my kids and when they got bored with it, and had enough of the encouragement, the worker simply moved on to something else. Many times, she would let my kids choose what to do next out of her bag.</P> <P>I can\'t pick which is better because, any and all fall into place with each other. My kids also needed PT.

'Ok....we have had lots of talk about schools providing an appropriate education to kids and that frequently the schools fall far short of what they should be doing. I have a situation right now in the program I teach where we have an excellent program and provide the best program in the area, but have a family in my class that refuses to write to school in a communication notebook (and every checklist and form I have created to encourage it), refuse to attend team meetings, refuse to schedule parent trainings, and have openly admitted they doing nothing with their child at home and don\'t intend to. Now we provide a service that school districts \"buy\" as a program placement at a cost of about $95,000 a year per child. There are other programs in the area that cost significantly less, and do have people trained in children with autism. The CSE committee at this child\'s meeting stated that unless the family gets on board with the school\'s program by getting involved they will place him in a less expensive autism program. We are going to meet in a few months to review the situation. Just wondered what people thought about that. There is a waiting list for our program and many familes like the ones here who would do anything and work hard for their child in our program. Is it fair to keep a child whose family has admitted they won\'t do anything and we are essentially babysitting him, versus taking a family who will play an active role?<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Tricia - NY  Mom to John 10 -ASD & Paige - 6 (but going on 20)  A BCBA creating an autism program from the ground up!!</div>'

'<P>Just an update.</P> <P>We met with a psychoeducational therapist at TEACCH and explained the problems at school-issues with transitions, some meltdowns, social issues, etc. She saw that Trevor was very involved with us and observed him briefly playing with toys. Even with everything I explained about school, she said he just doesn\'t seem autistic. She recommended that we have him checked for possible ADD or ADHD as well as anxiety issues. Of course I would be very happy if this is the case, but it just doesn\'t seem to explain everything. (?) I know that kids with ADD often have social problems but it seems like it is due to impulsivity, etc. Trevor is not impulsive with other kids. He just doesn\'t seem to \'get\' them too well and doesn\'t have too much interest in joining in with them (in a typical way). He seems so much like many of the kids mentioned on here.</P> <P>She recommended a behavioral pediatrician (knowledgeable about autism) and we will hopefully be able to get in to see him within two months. The school is going to have an autism specialist come in to observe Trevor in class in a couple of weeks as well, so we will see what comes of that. I guess it is just so confusing now, but I am reading Emotions to Advocacy and trying to get ready for the IEP meeting. Trevor\'s (young twit) teacher has said twice to me that it\'s just not working for him in her class-I haven\'t seen her make any efforts like writing down his routines (as I recommended at the beginning of the year). She just seems like she doesn\'t want to deal with him. Maybe she is not aware of LRE and thinks he will just be sent to some room somewhere out of her hair.

'<P>504 is a way to officially record that your child has a disability, even if it is not currently affecting his or her educational progress. I don\'t know much more about it, but I do know that it comes with a plan of sorts. HOWEVER (and this is a BIG however) no one on the autism spectrum will EVER be free of educational issues. That\'s because PDD-NOS and other autism spectrum disorders cause a permanent inability to deal with social and communication issues in the same way a NT does. This will NEVER go away. It may become better, but it will always cause difficulty in school. Perhaps not in scores on tests,but in practice. That\'s called pragmatics. In any event, your child is way, way too young for anyone to be able to predict how your daughter will react as she gets older. Don\'t let them take away her IEP.</P> <P>I only know how special education law is applied in New York State, but our regulations are based on the Federal law - IDEA. Go to <A href=\"http://www.wrightslaw.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.wrightslaw.com</A> and check out IDEA. I believe they have a link on their site but this is also an awesome site to find out all kinds of special ed things. In NY, there is a whole section written into the law that applies only to students classified as autistic (any child on the autism spectrum, including those dx\'d with PDD-NOS and Asperger\'s Syndrome). You might want to go to the part of THIS site that includes resources, state by state, and see if there\'s a link to your state\'s special education regulation of IDEA. Also, research locally how to get an advocate to help you. Take advantage of every opportunity to go to meetings and lectures that help you learn to advocate for your daughter. You are at the very beginning of a long school journey. Learn to be your daughter\'s best advocate now and you will be doing her the biggest favor of her life. Don\'t allow the bureaucracy to determine her future. You are a taxpayer and your daughter has the right to a free and APPROPRIATE education. You are her key to that appropriate education.</P>'

'Mama, this IEP goes into effect when you sign it, or two weeks from the date it is written. This means they are planning if February for what his needs in February- not next September. This is why I like the middle of the school year better than May. In May, they are not planning for September, they are planning for May, June, July, August, then September. The thing is - I can guarantee they won\'t work on those goals all through the summer even if he got ESY.'
'What I mean is that Asperger\'s Syndrome DOES fit into this definition for educational purposes. There is no classification for Asperger\'s Syndrome separately in educational law. All ASD dx\'s fall under autism, educationally. I know that some parents have been forced to classify their Asperger\'s children under Emotionally Disabled, but that is NOT the case. Asperger\'s is NOT an emotional disability, it is a pervasive developmental disability and, therefore, it falls under Autism, educationally. All AS kids fit the definition I quoted above. Don\'t let them talk you into ED or any other spec. ed. classification under which your child will get fewer protections.'
'<P>My dd\'s IEP was yesterday and although not as contentious as last year, still a struggle. We didn\'t want big changes..just keep everything the same. The principal is brand new, the SSC (student services coordinator) was on maternity leave. So they agreed to reduce OT by 1/2 (which is o.k..she is doing good), keep speech the same (60 minutes a week), keep the one:one support with a reduction to 60 minutes a day on ABA drills in pull out. I agreed to all of this. What surprised me was the fight I had on placement!! I wanted to keep my dd in kindergarten for another year. She started kindergarten at age 4!!! The cut off here is Dec 31 and just this year they started a jr. k and sr. K with the jr. kindergarten being for children born after August. My dd\'s birthday is Sept 25. The reg ed K teacher and the speech therapist and o.t. all wanted to promote her to 1st grade. I was like \"why?\". Eventually I got the principal to agree with me and she will be retained in Kindergarten for one more year. I got the impression that the people wanting to promote her didn\'t understand that autism is a DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY. I should add here that my daughter is verbal, but not very. She isn\'t conversational and she has trouble with abstract concepts. I think that in the FAll I will call another meeting and ask that everyone who works with my daughter get autism training. I guess this is just a warning that people may just see your child\'s improvement and not realize how far they have to go. I don\'t think they realize that everything dd knows, she had to be taught. So if your child is in general education..make sure that they understand kids on the autism spectrum!!!</P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> </P>'

'Hmmm... ya I have read several accounts of this occuring and am not too sure what to think about it. <br /> <br />I mean... granted it is a lawsuit happy society that causes this, nobody wants to be liable, so these days cops are called when a student acts up in a self or others threating manner. <br /> <br />I will say when I was growing up I never got any special treatment, and Thank God it was a different world back then. I never would expect society to make changes to suit me personally, but I think society needs to be more accepting and try to make life for kids with ASD easier, afterall their are many more cases every day. <br /> <br />Unfortunatly I dont think society is or should be required to make all sorts of changes and consessions because thats not how the world works, sucks but its just the way it is. <br /> <br />Society can make life easier thru acceptance and understanding, but no special rules or other accomodations should be made, I dont think anyways. Its just when I was a kid and the incidence of ASD was about 1:10,000 nobody would spend the time and money just for a few cases, setting up escape rooms and such. <br /> <br />I think perhapse it may be important to try and help these kids adjust to society a bit more, my God I had too. Never could I walk up too my boss for any reason and attack him, and then say afterwards sorry... but I have ASD and you didnt set up a special room for me to escape too. Id be fired or laughed at for even saying something like that, its complety unrealistic in the adult world for people like me to ask for special accomodations, as hard as it was as a child, I was expected to conform to society, and not the other way around. <br /> <br />Now, with the incidence of ASD at about 1:166 perhapse schools should make some changes to defuse situations, but for Gods sakes, as rediculous as it is this kid attacked someone, and these days whether we like it or not police will come and arrest you for it, and a judge will decide what happens. <br /> <br />These kids are going to grow up expecting special treatments as adults from society, but that ends after school it seems. If kids with ASD receive no consiquence for their actions, and expect special rooms and $hit, and constantly meltdown without consiquence, as adults they are not going to cut it at the job, or in life, whatever. <br /> <br />Their is alot more understanding now about ASD, and we have more of a way to go, but we cant go too far. My God if I melted down and flipped out at home when I was a kid I would get my ass kicked by dad, their are plenty of times at work or where ever I would feel very overwelmed and wanna flip out, or go to a special room or whatever, but ASD kids gotta learn to maintain somehow, control, get a grip, maby take a step back or whatever, because you melt down in the adult world and the only special room you get has bars and concrete in it. I can say that with experience. <br /> <br />So we gotta find a healthy balance, and so far we have made progress, but it just cant go too far. Thats my opinion anyways, maby I grew up in different times.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- DX\'ed with HFA as a child. Nowdays what I have would be called AS.</div>'

'Well, I would question their reasoning since the diagnostic center\'s evaluation was done at SD request, not yours. Since if they did it (w/o your request) then its not an IEE. But you\'d need proof.<br><br>Recollection is (and I\'m not a lawyer, I just have had to learn the laws) is that you can request an Independent Educational Evaluation for every evaluation that they have done (or decided was unnecessary). I would think that you <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">could</span> have asked for an IEE in response to the diagnostic center\'s evaluation. But you should be able to do that in response to the early triannual w/o reference to earlier evaluations.<br><br>However, locally the school district seems to hate IEEs. We are trying to get reimbursed for an IEE that they approved and they are fighting it every way possible. Sadly, the state dept of education is helping them. In another IEE they simply refuse to respond to anything all our mails go down a back hole. So it would not surprise me that the SD came up with an excuse to try and deny you the IEE.<br><br> <span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Dad2Luke&Alan on April 30 2009 at 8:32pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it - U Sinclair  We choose to go to the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard - JFK</div>'
'I am curious how others have been communicating with their child\'s teacher. I have read that some parents record specific routines (daily journals, weekly e-mails, meetings, etc.) in their IEPs, and I was wondering what others have found worked best. Has anyone created a form that they have provided for the teacher, or that the teacher has provided you with, that works? Communication, or lack thereof, in my son\'s private preschool has been very frustrating (i.e., we usually only hear about issues when they have reached a critical point), and we would like to improve going forward as he begins Kindergarten.

'I have done parent trainings on this and I strongly recommend using a large 3-ring binder that can hold two years of school records (there is a 2-year look-back in Hearings, in case you ever have to have one). I put the date I\'ve received a document IN PENCIL in the upper right-hand corner and then punch 3 holes in it and put it in the binder IN REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. I DO NOT separate certain types of documents and put them in separate sections. By using the reverse chronological system, you can oftentimes get a better idea of how things are progressing because the mix of documents paints a picture of how things are going at any point in TIME. Time is critical for Due Process, too. If I need copies of anything to bring to a meeting, I can find these things because I know ABOUT when they arrived (for example, report cards ALWAYS come quarterly as do the Progress Toward Goals reports, IEPs generally come once a year at the end of the current school year, etc.) If I need this year\'s and last year\'s IEPs to compare, I take them out and MAKE COPIES for the meeting and then put the originals back in the chronological system. I keep OFFICAL school records in this binder. Any hard copies of email correspondence, I keep in a separate binder and I keep a basket with copies of school work. At the end of the year, I take out the info older than 2 years and store it in the attic. I put schoolwork in the attic, too. I may or may not keep the correspondence past the current school year, depending on its importance.'

That being said, she knows her alphabet. She can say her entire alphabet clearly and she can recognize all of her letters.</P> <P>For Christmas Santa brought her a leapfrog refrigerator magnet alphabet tool. It is a small box where dd can insert individual letter magnets in. Once she inserts the letter in the box it will sing \"A - A says \"aaaa\" and A says \"ahh\", Every letter makes a sound and A says \"aaa\"\" (I hope thats understandable, in other words once you put the letter inside the box it tells you the letter and the sounds the letter says.) My dd plays with this many times a day. I didn\'t think much of it until I was reading her a book. I asked her what color the stop sign was and she said S-T-O-P. When I knew she was recognizing her letters I really encouraged her. I got her the foam letters for the tub and now she will pick one up and say the letter and its sound, she will even arrange them in alphabetical order.</P> <P>So, without an education background - I can\'t tell you how she learned it, but she did and I am amazed.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>-   Mom of 9 y/o ds with Cystic Fibrosis and 4 y/o dd with PDD-NOS</div>'

'<P>According to IDEA, there is NO requirement of getting a medical diagnosis of any autism spectrum disorder for your child to be considered educationally autistic. For school purposes, your child just has to meet the following definition.

Also, \"adversely affecting education\" includes poor social skills. Here\'s the current definition FYI:</P> <P><strong><EM>AUTISM (as defined in IDEA)</EM></strong></P> <P><strong><EM>Autism means a developmental disability significantly affecting verbal and nonverbal communication evident before age 3, that adversely affects a child\'s educational performance. Other characteristics often associated with autism are engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped movements, resistence to environmental change, a change in daily routines and unusual responses to sensory experiences.</EM></strong></P> <P><strong><EM>(i) Autism does not apply if a child\'s educational performace is adversely affected primarily because the child has an emotional disabiltiy.</EM></strong></P> <P><strong><EM>(ii) A child who manifests the characteristics of autism after age 3 could be identified as having autism if the other criteria are satisfied.</EM></strong></P>'

'<P>Taylor HATED the bus here. I didn\'t have a problem back home but I think it is because, Colin and her had separate buses for some reason and, she has behavioral issuees with him. Also, we had a new bus driver (she had the same one for years that knew her) and a new her well. </P> <P>I started following the bus, to see what might be happening. In her case, they were arriving at the school, 10 minutes early. paras do not arrive until 8 am. Taylor is very routined. She knows that, once the bus pulls up, you get off and go into the school to meet the para. The routine change by just 10 minutes threw her completely off, by making her wait at the school. So, we had to deal with the bus company, as well as making sure the schedule went back to the way she is used to. If he arrives early now, he drives around for 10 minutes so she doesn\'t have to sit and wait (they wanted to put her in restraints-I refused. I knew the problem wasnt behavior as it was routine being disrupted).</P> <P>Another issue I have is her terrible issues with noise. The buses here have fans that are put on where the driver sits, because they have no ac and the weather here can get into a heat index (and humidity high) of 110 degrees. Between being overheated as well the sound of the fan going, she couldnt deal with it. So, we had to ask for them to shut fan off until she is dropped off-and now they drop her off first so they can put the fan on when she leaves.</P> <P>Unfortunately, my only other alternative when I had problems with bullying by both the bus driver (she called my oldest the SLOW, FAT KID in front of whole class) was to drive them every day. I made arrangements for the sped paras to meet me at the back door, so they didn\'t have to wait in front and deal with the crowds of children fooling around before school. If the bus thing had persisted here, I would have done the same. It\'s hard enough with all we go through now-the last thing I want is the trauma for her to start from bus ride on.</P> <P>Have you asked if you can ride along to see maybe what it is that is bothering her, and then weaning yourself off-maybe telling her you will meet her at the school, then just weaning that down until she is comfy on the bus? It\'s just a suggestion. We seem to each have to do things in our own way.</P> <P> </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Colin/Taylor ASD, Molly, Sean(SD)/Ryan</div>'

'You can ask the school district to pay for Independent Educational Evaluations for each evaluation they did. That way, you pick the outside evaluator and they pay for it. They MUST agree to this or they must IMMEDIATELY take you to an expedited hearing to show a hearing officer why their own evaluation is valid. That will cost them far more than just paying for the evaluation. FROM EMOTIONS TO ADVOCACY gives you instructions on how to do all of this, including sample letters.'

'Call and IEP meeting and ask the Team to address your concerns. Being in a huge class like that, in and of itself, can cause great distress. See if they come up with a different sort of placement. For example, if a nearby district has another sort of class that is smaller. Or perhaps there is a special education school that he can be sent to instead of the local HS. The reality is that HS is HS. Lots of kids, lots of commotion, not much individual attention, great expectations of maturity and a high academic bar. Many kids who do well in the lower grades in typical placements can\'t hack a typical HS placement because of just what you point out. And it\'s hard to change the stripes on a zebra. HS is what HS is. Some accommodations might be able to be made - see what those might be.'

'<P>What does your child receive? And what if you do not like the speech therapist? </P> <P>My child is not going to receive any one on one speech therapy from what the speech therapist at the ARD said. She said speech therapy is offered as a group. When she described speech therapy, it sounded like she just reads a book to the kids every day in a group (of 10-18 kids 1/2 are NT). This is a PPCD class. I feel like this a joke. They say it is important for social and that is why they are not doing 1:1. I can see if it was 2 or 3 kids but 10-18? </P> <P>Also, seperate issue but I do not like this speech therapist. She has appeared cold and stand offish from the get go.

'My daughter attends a private school which may be a diservice to her due to lack of school Psycholigist or proper channels for testing and diagnosis. In first grade she struggled, we had to work extra hard with her every night on homework to grasp pretty basic concepts. Definately a hands on learner. I\'m afraid as she goes on the hurdls will only get more difficult. My reason for wanting a diagnosis is to get her the approraite therapy and also to kind of understand more where her \"odd\" behaviors come from. Perhaps I will have more patience with her and have the appropraite tools to help her in her social and academic life. her diagnosis will also help me deal with signs of adult Autism I believe I have. ANy thoughts on where to go for help if we\'re not in the public school district. I think it\'s going to be more difficult to diagnose her because she is high functioning. She could very easily fall through the cracks. Thanks for the input so far!'

'My thought is based on my local school district and how they have treated my sons. I hope that yours is better...<br><br>The medical profession gives a medical diagnosis, and the schools give an educational diagnosis. While they probably ought to be similar, in my case the school has ignored any medical diagnosis we have had when they are deciding on their educational diagnosis for services. And for some reason the educational diagnosis has always pointed to a service that is somewhat cheaper than what the medical diagnosis recommends. Or no service at all.<br><br>Depending on your financial situation I would be tempted to suggest an outside evaluation so that you can get an evaluation that is free of biases of trying to save money. I don\'t believe that school districts would classify as autism to get federal dollars, my experience is that we have had an on-going fight for a year now to get the classification so that we can get services. And if what I read is correct, the federal dollars to not come anyplace close to reimbursing the local school districts.<br> <span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Dad2Luke&Alan on July 14 2008 at 8:43pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it - U Sinclair  We choose to go to the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard - JFK</div>'

I agree-the label is something our kids need today-even with SSI, you now have to have specific dx\'s in many state to get help.</P> <P>As long as your child has symptoms on the spectrum, I hope he keeps the dx of autism.

'\"... your own body.\"<br><br>That is apparently what the autism teacher has been telling my son about motor breaks and why SHE must choose what he does during them. <br><br>This is a long-term sub (who has been there the whole year) and she is telling him that he doesn\'t know his own body to know what he should do on motor breaks. He used to get choices as to what activities he could do during his scheduled motor breaks. Now, she gives him 3 cards (face down so he can\'t see what\'s on them) and he gets to pick one. And then he has to do whatever is on the card. I guess it is a way of helping him feel he is \"choosing\" what to do. This does not fool my son - he is NOT happy about this.<br><br>This and a bunch more all came out tonight. I had a meeting with his mainstream teacher and principal earlier today because I\'ve been unhappy with the lack of communication from the autism teacher, among other things. His mainstream teacher called me today with some concerns (about the teacher, not so much about my ds, except about how he is reacting to her - which is negatively). And then I decided to ask to meet with her and with the principal. I wish I would have had this information that my ds told me before the meeting.<br><br>She (the autism teacher) is also trying to put a weighted lap pad on him during reading and he HATES it (this is in a mainstream classroom by the way and I had NO IDEA this was going on). He told me that and said he pushes it off and then she puts it right back on him. It\'s like she\'s been told to do something (by the OT, I\'m assuming) and she just keeps pushing it without regard to how it is affecting my ds. It\'s like she\'s treating him like he\'s subhuman and his opinions don\'t count. Now, I get it that he\'s a kid and he doesn\'t always know what\'s best for him. But to SHUT HIM DOWN and tell him he doesn\'t know his own body? My dh\'s reaction was that this teacher should no longer have any contact with ds whatsoever - he is really ticked off at that. I agree that what she said is a horrible message to send to a child. Not to mention that I have found that he generally DOES know his own body and what he needs. HE is the one who asked to be taken out of his classroom during inside recess (when they sit and watch TV) because he felt like he needed to get his energy out. But, I know we need to work within the system (my dh tends to over-react in situations like this, which is ironic as it is usually ME doing that. I guess we balance each other!).<br><br>I told my ds I was very proud of him for telling me and that I do trust him and think he often knows what\'s best for his body. I\'m walking a very fine line because I don\'t want him to get the idea that he knows better than teachers (although in this case he does). But, I did tell him that I can never do anything to help unless he tells me these things and that I can\'t promise him that things will change - but I would promise that I will talk to the teacher and try to clear up any misunderstandings.<br><br>I am just FURIOUS and trying to calm myself down here. This teacher is new and has almost no experience in autism and I was not happy when they hired her as the sub. I have tried and tried to give her the benefit of the doubt - but I am way beyond that now. The principal was very upset about things she learned during our meeting today and she said to me, \"You know in teaching kids with autism - you either get it or you don\'t.\" She didn\'t say anything more - she didn\'t need to. Clearly, this teacher does NOT get it. And this principal does (she used to be an autism teacher).<br><br>We don\'t know if the old autism teacher is coming back or not - but it was clear from the meeting today that this sub will NOT be asked to stay on if the old teacher does not come back. The principal asked me today if I had my license or if I could get it quick! I laughed and said no. <br><br>Anyway, I haven\'t had issues with a school about my ds in so long (major ones at least) and I guess I just needed to vent about it. I am just worried that she is doing damage to my son\'s self-esteem. Although I was happy to hear him say, \"But mom - she\'s WRONG. I DO know my body and I usually know what I need to do to calm myself down.\" And he is totally right - he usually does. The old autism teacher would tell me how impressed she was with his self-awareness about that and she always wanted to encourage that (which is what you\'re SUPPOSED to do - not SQUASH it down!).<br><br>Wow, sorry for the long post. I\'m glad at least I have the administration on my side - I\'m probably going to call a team meeting to discuss several issues. This is the same teacher who last week let him get away with not doing his math work during class and sent it home for us to do at home. NOT okay!

'Try to get a full day with K. If they refused ask to pay for a full day but if the refuse after you asked to pay, the child becomes more behind at the end of the school year and they offer full day K to other students (with out IEP\'s) of free. They can get sued. It does not help them when the IEP was not done right in the first place..<br><br>My daughter was sposed to have a full day of K in FL but we moved to CO and they removed it from her IEP. They won\'t give her a full day of K and I even would of paid for it. She went 2 hrs and some mins but she became more behind bec. she had ot, speech, behavorial and could not get her reg. ed in 2 hrs. The IEP was not written right and she became more behind in her goals and ob. <br><br> At the end of the school year they wanted to hold her back AND GIVE HER A FULL DAY OF K. I told them why should my daughter suffer more by your SCREW-UPS. I found out from another resousce teacher in another district in the same county. The schools here are sposed to give IEP kids first choice!!!!!! I also found out I could sue them but I want results instead. My district got sued last year by another parents and the year before on and on...!<br> <br> This year they have backed off on there little tricks. They still nit pick but that\'s all so far.

'Karolysgirl - These words searches are really just time fillers that are easy for the teachers. If it\'s going to involve work on their parts, that negates the reason they are used. I am not dissing my son\'s teachers. I know they are pretty overwhelmed and need ways of keeping kids who get done with their work early engaged. My son would probably just put his head on the desk and nap if he didn\'t have some sort of work to do. During the school year, not that many word searches come home. During the summer is when I got a PILE of them sent home at the end of the program. I\'ve got to figure out something better for next summer. In my son\'s case, I think he enjoys them a bit, but gets obsessive with them. I also don\'t want him doing them for homework anymore. We have lots to do at home, so we don\'t need filler paperwork. I think using word searches to help reinforce important words that appear in current lessons is a good idea. That\'s not how I\'ve seen any teachers around here use them. I don\'t want you to think we have incompetent teaches. They use lots of other creative ways to get lessons across. It\' just this word search thing is busywork, so I don\'t feel as though I have to push it at home. Thanks for your input on this. It\'s great to hear from a teacher who is also dealing with this as a mom.'

'Is there another SLP in the district who might do the pragmatic eval??? Nothing wrong w/private SLPs but it can be hard to identify subtle pragmatic language deficits in a private clinic setting where the SLP can\'t really observe interaction between your daughter and her peers. In addition, the school district is under no obligation to pay heed to the private SLPs report. As far as the classroom idea, the classroom is actually a great place for social language skills to be practiced but make sure there is an actual program in place, not the assumption that simply by being present in class your daughter will automatically pick up skills. Mabey your SLP could consult with the classroom teacher re: ways to facilitate social skills in the class or the SLP could teach formal language skills programs within the class. I think that might be more beneficial than pull out therapy anyways. Michelle Garcia Winner has wonderful programs that can be taught in the class. Good luck!'

'Just before my son turned 3, I met with the school and two of the first things that were said to me was <br />1.

I will tell you what we have and you tell me if you are even interested in it. <br />Of course, I can not PROVE this, but it is almost text book perfect for \'breaking in\' a new family.

Of course, it\'s feasible that it can be done differently in your distirct, but doing it this way will always get results.</P> <P>I DON\'T get why are REAL mirror is necessary. If it\'s for speech issues, that mirror should be with the speech teacher in the speech room. If children, for some reason, need to see themselves clearly in a real mirror, what about one that can be affixed to the wall? I believe that is the sort of mirror that was available in the classrooms my son went to when he was little.</P> <P>There are two issues here. 1. Getting a real mirror out of the hands of the kids. 2. Addressing the aggression issues between the two boys. I think you probably have to address them separately.</P>'

'Ditto to what MosesJr-Mommy said. Early intervention can be a very key <br />part in helping our kids & it is important. For us, we started w/ private <br />therapy while we waited for EI. Then did a mix of private PT, EI OT & <br />ST...then went completely private for all therapies...then back to EI for OT, <br />behavioral therapy and private ST & PT. It had a lot to do with the <br />therapist\'s personalities & also the dedication & progress we saw in the <br />private sector. Our dd now attends spec ed preschool, and the teacher/ <br />staff are all amazing! So, trust your gut when it comes to the <br />professionals in your child\'s life-switch until you find the ones that you <br />click with and your child does well with. <br /> <br />Your child is VERY young & that is great with regard to early intervention, <br />but please be aware that all the therapy in the world may not help your <br />child completely overcome those PDD signs you see. There are a lot of <br />variables for our children, they are all individuals and what works for one <br />may not help another at all. Follow your heart & remember, your child is <br />your child, a diagnosis of autism doesn\'t change that.

'I think you are making a good decision. Since your daughter is already <br />modeling the social behavoirs of peers, why not expose her to typical <br />peers whose behaviors are better developed. She will have the <br />oppurtunity to interact with peers who will be more fluent than her. My <br />son is at typical preschool with a 1:1 shadow aide. We are doing the <br />following to make sure that things are going as smoothly as possible. <br /> <br />1. The 1:1 shadow is a behavioral aide. She is there to help him with task <br />diection; redirecting him to task when he is noncomplient/distracted; <br />maintaining clear and firm limits and managing behaviors when he tests <br />that;supporting him as he expresses is idea;guiding him through <br />transitions; and facilitating social interactions through modeling and <br />coaching. <br /> <br />He did not start out doing well at circle time(story time) he worked at it. <br />He did not start out well with playing with others, he worked on that as <br />well. The one thing that my son had was well developed pre-academic <br />skills. EVerything else he worked at. It has been over a year and he is a <br />different kid.

'<P>An FBA is an EVALUATION. As such, it is subject to Independent Educational Evaluation rules. Go to Wrightslaw to find out about IEEs if you need to. I\'d ask, in writing, for an IEE. Then have them pay to bring in YOUR choice of evaluator - preferably a BCBA. Yes, your child may be \"defiant\" (i.e., noncompiant) but an FBA is supposed to discover the FUNCTION of his \"definance\" and use that info to put together a positive behavior intervention plan. If you think the current placement\'s academic levels are appropriate, I\'d hold my ground and insist that they bring in a consultant to help them figure out how to manage your son\'s behavior in class.</P>'

Count them the second time. etc. It really sounds like he is playing the same game my son plays where he will do things at school but by the time he gets home he is so sensory overloaded that it is a battle to get him to do anything.

'<P>Riegelbeagle</P> <P>I am in NC and understand completely. We are just over the limit for Health Choice Insurance and way over for medicaid. I teach school and my husband is diabled. Our insurance does cover OT, but that is it. We have been trying to go through an agency to get some respite or a worker to help at school. We will most likely be turned down because we do not get medicaid. I have considered just quitting work and let the government support us. Not really I have too much pride, but it is not fair that ASD children can not get help in NC!</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Lori</div>'
'<P>In the current issue of Time, there\'s an article called \"The Health Care Crisis Hits Home\" by Karen Tumulty.

'My son had an IEP, was exited from Special Ed, and now has a 504 plan.<br><br>So in my state PPD/NOS can qualify you for services - at least temporarily. But they are right - PDD/NOS is not listed as a qualifying condition. The law (if memory serves) is something like autism and autism-like conditions, and PDD/NOS is definiately autism-like. So you are being jerked around somewhat about the PDD/NOS never qualifying. On the other hand, we have been fighting for 2 years now to get our son re-qualified since we now know what services he needs that the SD is failing to provide. We have been through a round of evaluations, a round of IEEs, and then a round of re-evaluations and are about to start a second round of IEEs. We have a well know lawyer guiding us through the process. So I do understand about being jerked around about PDD/NOS qualifying (or not). There is probably a nasty due process hearing in our future. There have been several nasty IEP meetings. And total loss of faith in the special education system.<br><br>But getting back to your question. In a nut shell IEPs are about customised instruction to help you child. 504\'s are about accomodations to allow you child to access the existing curriculum. For the IEP think speech therapists, psychologists and the like. For the 504 think preferrential seating, modified classwork, extra time for reading problems in class, and similar. If your child is so distruptive that he cannot attend class, or needs so much 1:1 instruction that the teacher cannot provide it, then a 504 will not fix it.<link rel=\"colorSchemeMapping\"

'<P>HI Cindy.</P> <P>For fund-raising, our homeschool support group gets together with our local pizza place (New Orleans Pizza here in Canada) and we have these cards made for our group, New Orleans pays all printing costs of these so no expenses for us. On each card, it says that the bearer of the card is entitled to a free 3rd pizza of their choice when purchasing 2 other pizzas at regular cost. This card is valid for 10 months from time of purchase and can be re-used as often as people wish. Each card is sold for $10.00 with ALL profits going to our homeschool support group (so if we sell 50 cards to friends, neighbors and relatives, that\'s $500.00 profit, we sell 100, $1000.00, etc.)</P> <P>Now this doesn\'t sound like much of a deal but a typical family who does pizza night once per week will save approximately (40 weeks x $20.00 for an average pizza = $800.00 Adds up quickly!!)</P> <P>We never have any trouble selling these cards each year and we then have money to pay for field trips and other activities. Our support group also asks each family to pay yearly fees for things such as insurance (when we get together as a group) and library books which we buy for the entire group to share.</P> <P>Best of luck.</P> <P>Claire </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to 4 children, oldest age 24 and youngest age 14 ASD, 2 NT teens in between</div>'
'<P>DYSLEXIA means \"inability to read.\" That is what the term actually means. It involves visual processing problems. It\'s possible that someone has used the term \"dyslexia\" casually to describe what auditory processing is. Yes, it is like dyslexia of the ears. But it is NOT dyslexia, which technically ONLY refers to reading. Just as \"dysgraphia\" means inability to write (as in handwriting). LEX is the root word for read. </P> <P>Auditory processing disorder is analogous to Visual processing disorder. IT\'s just that the first is all about hearing and the second is all about seeing. SInce lack of ability to read is a visual processing issue, CAPD is NOT about reading. It\'s about processing hearing properly, although there IS some research that shows that CAPD CAN interfere with phonics. However, plenty of people with no visual processing issues learn to read using method other than phonics. That is what every multisensory reading program is all about (Orton-Gillingham, Wilson, etc.)</P>'

'I am SOOOO proud of my son this morning and myself, lol. I must fill you guys in.<br><br>Last week, after all of these things were brought to my attention, I decided to sit down and write a letter to the teacher. The bullying was talked about first, the PALS thing was addressed second.<br><br>The teacher called me within an hour of school starting to find out what is going on and I talked to her.<br><br>The bullying has since stopped-she knew that the 2 were fighting a lot, but did not know that the little girl was going out of her way to make his life miserable in school every day. So she talked to the girl and Zack both, and they have an understanding to just stay away from one another, and the little girl was talked to about being a bully and what that means and all.<br><br>The PALS thing, however, the teacher said she was going to put him into a group, and I was happy.<br><br>So the other night, Zack comes home, horrendous behavior once again, and he had picked this Star Wars book out to read. I asked him if he got it from the library and he said he had, and that it was for silent reading time. But he didn\'t seem too happy about it, which is odd, because he LOVES STAR WARS! <br><br>So I pushed a little more to find out he was a floater again that day, so he sat alone and read during class.<br><br>This morning he brought up the being a floater thing, once again, and kept saying it doesn\'t bother him, which sometimes I accept as him just venting or talking about something, but he had this odd tone about it, and he seemed... exasperated by it.<br><br>So I was brave... I\'ve never met the principal before, and wasn\'t really sure what to expect... I also rarely drive him to school because there are so many crowds and all these people walking around and it\'s kind of like watching people walk past from a vehicle-everyone comes up and you see them clearly, but they pass in a blur, and after a while, they are all blurs. It\'s quite overwhelming. So I started kind of rocking back and forth, but still made it to the office.<br><br>I went in there and told them that I needed to talk to someone about something going on in his class and wanted to make sure I was informing the correct person, so they had me sit at a desk and wait for the principal to come back. Which, was really hard to just sit there and deal with when people were still walking past and all, lol, but I managed.<br><br>The principal came out finally (after about 10 minutes probably), and asked what I wanted to talk to her about. I addressed several things and had something ready every time she said something, lol.<br><br>Her: Zachary... what grade is he in?<br><br>Me: He\'s in 3rd, I don\'t know if you remember or not, but he was suspended for punching someone in the stomach last year and everyone kept commenting how out of character that was for him to be violent like that to someone else.<br><br>Her: Ah, yes, I know him. What is going on in the class?<br><br>Me: Well, first it was bullying but that was addressed... sort of. See they have the PALS program, and when the bullying was going on he was in a group with his bully and couldn\'t deal with the harrassment and started acting up. He was removed from the group and was made a \"floater\". Now, I don\'t know if you realize this or not, but that is one of the worst ideas possible for an Aspie kid. He NEEDS routine and structure, and when he walks into class on PALS days, he does not know whether or not he will be participating, who he will work with, etc.<br><br>Her: (obviously knowing NOTHING about autism alone) Do they put kids like him on medication (pause, sorting thoughts most likely to word it properly), is he on any medication or does he have any other diagnoses besides Asperger\'s?<br><br>Me: No, and he doesn\'t need it. Kids with just autism generally just need a lot of structure and consistency, as well as routine, and they do much better. Sometimes co-morbids can develop which can need medication, but that is not in all cases. He is not one that needs it.<br><br>Her: Well his behavior-<br><br>Me: I know about his behavior. I live with him. I also know most of the time it is purely situational, and he isn\'t doing it to act out. If he is doing a behavior to cope and gets in trouble for it, that is just telling him he is not allowed to cope rather than providing another way for him to cope with stress. I asked about him being in a class with a teacher who understands how to work with this stuff, because he is not just like every other kid, but it was refused.<br><br>Her: He is so high functioning though that we wouldn\'t want to do that to him.<br><br>Me: yes, I understand that, but because of it, he is encountering problems with this over and over and his behavior is not being treated properly because the teachers don\'t know much about it. That is why I need to be involved in decision making based on these things.<br><br>Her: Well let\'s call him up here...<br>-<br>Okay, first I must apologize for that long-winded version of what went on. I am just so proud of myself for actually standing up to her and not just backing down like I have in the past when anyone seen as an authority figure starts talking to me about these things. Now, I will go onto why I am so darn proud of him-he NEVER speaks his mind, or very rarely does when anything is directly asked. He clams up, cannot decide things, and just has a hard time with telling how he feels... of course, you guys all know this about our kiddos, so here goes.<br>-<br>Her: Zachary, I understand you are a \"floater\" in the PALS program. Do you understand what a floater is?<br><br>Him: Yes.<br><br>Her: Can you explain it to me?<br><br>Him: I fill in when other people are gone, and the rest of the time I read by myself.<br><br>Her: (trying to confuse him and make it sound like it is his idea to do it) Well Zachary, would you like to be a \"coach\" instead? Then you could fill in for other people who are gone, and read to yourself during the other time.<br><br>Him: No. I do that already.<br><br>Her: Well what do you think about this?<br><br>Him: It\'s hard to understand what PALS is supposed to be all about when you are left by yourself all of the time. <br><br>Her: (pause) Well I have to agree there.<br><br>Him: It doesn\'t make much sense to me.<br><br>Her: Well, do you want a partner or do you want to be by yourself?<br><br>Him: I would like a permanent partner every time, every week, every day we do PALS.<br>-<br><br>We left with her saying she was going to talk to the teacher. I will be keeping my fingers crossed.<br><br>Her reasoning originally after he walked back to class, is that they usually make the kids who are advanced in reading be \"floaters\" and they help the other kids read and all. I told her he was originally in a group and feels like he got in trouble and was excluded due to it. She didn\'t have much else to say after that.<br><br>If you have read all of this, then thank you very much. If not, lol, I understand too, as it was quite a bit of typing. I just needed to throw it out there, as I\'m just so happy about it. All of the words imprinted themselves in my brain and I had to spill it out somewhere, lol.<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- 29 year old adult Aspie/HFA, with 8 year old son with Asperger\'s as well, and NT 5 year old daughter.</div>'

'Jaysdad - If this is a PUBLIC school, I have no idea. Connecticut should have very good special education laws. google IDEA, Conn. and see if you can bring up your state\'s regulation of the Federal law, IDEA. There also should be a special education resource for your area, paid for by public funds. Ask around in your specific area. Try to search your State Education Dept. site for special education. Check out their publications. You can find a lot of info in what the state publishes for public consumption. If necessary, pay for an hour of an education lawyer\'s time. Not only will it be cheaper than $500, but it will show your District that you are serious about your child\'s educational rights. They won\'t mess with you in the future. I have absolutely NO IDEA why they would ask you, a taxpayer, to pay twice for a school program.'

His IEp done in may reccommended him for a 12to 1 to 1 class and they also gave him a para to help him with transitions and staying on task. Anyway he got invited into a special ctt class also of 12 kids. There is one special ed and one reg. teacher. 8 mainstream kids and 4 on the spectrum. They put my son throught alot of tests to get into this class. I went to a meeting over the summer and the told me they would draft a new iep to tweak it. He was not going to have the same goals. Especially any daily living skills since his new class expects him to be able to do alot. I never received anything because they needed to evaulate him in sept for any additional therapy sessions. I had my new Iep meeting last week. I signed that I attended the meeting. He was given additional indiv. therapy sessions. They said they will send me a new Iep. Anyway my son is having a hard time adjusting. I am thinking about not signing my Iep when I receive it , so I can try to get him additional therapy. He has been stimming alot at home and just acting in class not well. New behaviors that he has never done before. Can I ask for more therapy? Also should I be getting some information from his physical therapist. At the meeting last week when he was already approved from the summer for indiv. physical therapy. He hasnt even been evaulated yet. Should I be asking for the name of his p.t.? He hasnt gotten pt for 3 weeks of school so far. </P> <P>Thanks, Im very confused. The cse process is so different from cpse</P> <P> </P> <P>Sharmyn</P>'
'Try MY FIRST WORD BOOK by DK publishing (it\'s available on Amazon and in just about every store that sells books). It\'s used often by autism teachers when the need photos instead of icons. There is a whole series of books like it. I think you\'ll find lots of uses for it. Plus, it\'s a great book to start using with your child to get him used to \"reading\" with you.'

'Once the school district conducts its evaluation, you always have the right to disagree and get an independent educational evaluation at public expense. Go to <A href=\"http://www.wrightslaw.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.wrightslaw.com</A> (as the pp mentioned) and search IEE. Once you present the results of your IEE at the meeting, the Team only has to \"consider\" it, not necessarily implement its recommendations (which is even true for their OWN evals). But if they reject your eval, they have to give you Prior Written Notice. They have to have given you a copy of your Procedural Safeguards. Most parents simply ignore this document, but that is at your peril. Find it. Read it. And if you don\'t have it anymore, request a new copy, which they HAVE to give you. These are your legal rights to disagree with the Team\'s decision.'

'The IEP Team is required to evaluate a child \"in all areas of suspected disability.\" If you suspect your child is having difficulty and that assessments in certain areas can enlighten the Team, definitely ask for evals in those areas. YOu can ask for evals as often as once a year. The 3 year evaluation is the minimum. Also, an IEP cannot be discontinued without the parent\'s written consent, so simply \"doing well\" on evaluations won\'t necessarily take away and IEP.'

'Put it in writing in his IEP to get his FBA done. I called a group meeting with the principal and all the specialist in our school to have mine done and had it put in the IEP with a month time for it to be completed and set up a meeting for a month later. Another thing in your situation I would look at is talking to a Special Ed lawyer because it sounds like the school is not acting the way they should. If he is autistic and in kindergarten and biting that happens. My son has done it and has never been suspended. I usual get a call from the teacher at the end of the day explaining what happened and what they did as punishment which is usually time out of some form or loss of an activity that he likes. Another option is can you get him a chewy to take to school with him so if he\'s nervous or upset he can chew on that. I honestly don\'t have any other suggestions then that.

'What WIMomOf2 said. FERPA is a FEDERAL law and covers all state, tho your state might even have stricter regulations (meaning the school would have to respond faster). They CAN charge 25 cents a page for the cost of copying, but if you ask to do a \"records review\" IN SCHOOL, they have to let you see the records in person for free. You can bring your own portable scanner or you can take digital photos of stuff for free. The school is likely to just send you the reports rather than have to devote the services of one of their employees to sitting with you, going over the reports in person. Another tactic would be to write to the Special Education Chairperson and say that you want to be able to fullly participate in the meeting and that by not seeing the reports ahead of time, your parental right to participation is being infringed. Offer to come to the school for a pre-meeting meeting so that they can go over the reports WITH you, if this is what they\'d like to do. But you MUST get those reports AND understand them BEFORE the official IEP meeting.'

'You need input from an Autism specialist, a positive behavior plan needs to be in place for these children. visual charts, rewards,sensory issues need to be addressed social skills need to be introduced, and you probably need an Aid just for those children ,that is educated in ASD. Try to find a local support group for help to understand these children. Ask for training from the school about Autism. Ask the parents for help about where you can find information about Autism, and listen to them if they have ideas that night help you in the classroom. Good Luck, I am sure others on this forum will have ideas too.'
'I started last year and spent so much money and found I couldn\'t pull it together between my one sons problems he wouldn\'t sit for the book work and that is when I searched the internet for some other ideas and found time 4 learning. It was a blessing to have him so interested in a program and then when my other son stopped going to school he began the program. Now we use a little of both, books and time 4 learning. I find the time 4 learning is so much fun, I really like watching them do it. My 9 year old didn\'t read until he started that program. That is why I still use it to help keep him in the mode of wanting to learn to read. Home schooling does get easier when you find what works and what is a good fit for your child.

You could talk to the sp ed secretary but I would just send in a letter because im sure you have mentioned it to the others on her IEP team already and in the letter specifically request each eval. she needs to show that she doesnt need those goals/accomodations. Tzoya said when asking for things in IEP you should focus on asking for concrete testing to show that your child needs what you would want to ask for, that way it makes things easier. Then if u disagree u can always request an IEE. But im confused as to why they even think they can drop all this from her IEP unless they are hoping you dont do anything about it and they can get away with it.

So monday when the bus pulled in the drive way I was already outside waiting and I noticed as she was nearing the drive way she was yelling his name over and over I could actually hear her with the windows down, she was waking him from his nap (he always falls asleep on the way home) she then was yelling for him to hurry up and get his seatbelt off and get his back pack on she kept saying come on hurry your home. Well now I figured out the problem his old bus driver who I loved dearly would park the bus get out of her seat gently wake him unbuckle his seat belt for him help him with his back pack and walk him to the steps into my care. The new bus driver will not get her rear out of her seat at all......which is fine but do not scream for him to wake up let me get on the bus and wake him so I do not have to deal with him having melt down tantrums because he is mad at his bus driver. I called her boss and put a bug in his ear and he informed me that within the next week she will be assigned to a new route and his old driver will be back due to other parents who complained about her. I find this so disturbing I know that it is not her job to coddle my son but it is common sense when you have a five year old with special needs you do not scream at the top of your lungs saying comeon hurry up!!!!!! I do not believe that she has had any proper training for her job......are bus drivers required to be trained for special needs children?? His transportation is not through the school district due to the fact that he is going to a school outside of the area the school district contracted a bus service to transport him rather than send someone all that way for one child. Should I request he have an aide?? This transportation stuff is all new to me and so frustrating I don\'t even yell at him like that and in no way will I tollerate a bus driver doing it either. </FONT></strong></P> <P><strong><FONT face=Arial size=2> But on a good note he came home from school on Monday and we were playing and talking about his day ,and he said to his sister, who was saying she wanted to go to sleep.....\"you have to wake up it is monday\" I have never heard him say a day of the week and it was the correct one!!! I know they have been working on it at school and it must be sinking in with him Finally!!!

'<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=3>We just had our transition meeting last month and it went really well. I had thought it might be a problem to get them to take my dd for 5 days a week rather than pt in a normal setting w/ aids. They said they WANT the children in there 5 days a week ( the ones that qualify) and it is usually the parents that want their child in a \"normal\" setting...I know that my dd will do much better with the reg. routine of 5 days.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Arial size=3>As for the eval process..........I just don\'t know what to tell you, we\'re in the same boat. I have recently had her evaluated by a dev. ped. and did a follow-up just today with her ped neuro that originally dx\'d her. I figure the more dr\'s I have backing me up the better it may go. I was honest with both docs and told them that I would be expecting them to write letters for me to the school district when it came to getting her IEP and qualifying. They were both very helpful and offered to do whatever we needed when the time comes.</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Arial size=3>I actually am not really concerned, though, that she won\'t qualify.

'<P>I\'m very glad you got the reports but it\'s VERY important that you KNOW that the ultimate LEGAL responsibility for an IEP is with the District. BOCES is a service provider. The District contracts with BOCES so that it can get your child\'s IEP met, but if BOCES can\'t meet the criteria in the IEP for some reason, the DISTRICT is still responsible. A common problem with some BOCES programs is that they come up short on therapists, often speech therapists. So they\'ll give only part of the number of therapies a particular student has on his IEP. The DISTRICT is then responsible for giving the extras thru a service or by some other means. The problem is that you may not FIND OUT. Make SURE all your child\'s therapists are doing all their sessions with your child. If not, contact the District, in writing, and get \"compensatory services.\" This is a BIG problems across the state. Let us know how the CSE goes.</P>'

'<P>Okay, I have to say (having been on the other side) that I THOUGHT it didn\'t matter that I didn\'t have kids (when I did in-home family therapy), but you truly can\'t understand what it\'s like until you\'ve been there as a parent. I had this said to me TONS of times and I would always get insulted - but I look back now and think, \"Wow, they were RIGHT!\" I don\'t think it made me ineffective as a therapist - actually, it probably gave me some needed professional distance. But, I really didn\'t understand what the parent was going through. There was just no way I could - I hadn\'t held them in my arms all night while they were throwing up or agonized over whether my child would ever be able to pedal a bike - or whether or not my child was \"different\" enough to have a disability like autism.</P> <P>But, you can still be an awesome teacher and not have kids - in fact, I was EXCITED when my ds\' ECSE teacher was young and just out of school. She had lots of energy and a willingness to listen to the parents. She was probably the best preschool teacher my ds had. </P> <P>I guess what this thread shows is that every parent and every teacher is different. I would wager that most of the parents and teachers on this board AREN\'T who are the problems! </P> <P>Teachers should know that parents have often not been taken seriously and had to fight for EVERYTHING for their child. When they actually encounter a teacher who CARES, it is almost hard to believe and we may be mistrustful at first. Please understand that we have been hurt (as has our child) so many times before that we have to be guarded and tread lightly.</P> <P>But some parents can be just plain jerks as well. Teachers are but one person and if parents don\'t communicate and cooperate - well, teachers just can\'t do their jobs as well. Did I mention I used to work at Head Start as well? A child needs both parents and teachers talking and working together - not fighting and avoiding each other. No one wins in that last scenario!</P> <P>I have encountered a lot of teachers (and parents too!) who are the opposite of what we see on this board. Teachers who don\'t care, who see our children as problems and would like them out of their classroom, who won\'t make any accommodations even though it is stated in the IEP, etc. I have seen parents who expect everything from the teachers, but don\'t work with the child at home one bit, who don\'t communicate with the teachers to let them know if their child is having an \"off\" day for whatever reason - or even that they MAY have an off day (for instance, I have called my ds\' teacher if he didn\'t get much sleep the night before to warn her he may have an \"off\" day). The more info a teacher has - the better prepared they are. Or parents who hound the teacher daily making all sorts of demands - not remembering that their child is not the only one in the classroom that the teacher is working with. </P> <P>If I call the teacher to let them know my ds may be having an \"off\" day - I keep it short and sweet. Sometimes I might e-mail before he leaves (I know they check their e-mails before school starts) or enclose a note in his folder he turns in. I don\'t want to become a pain, so I try to respect their time and be concise but give them the info they need for the day. It\'s a fine line, but from my experience as both teacher and therapist - I would prefer to know some info as opposed to nothing. But, I also had a limited amount of time - so being concise is important (which I am clearly not able to do in my posts but am better at with the teachers! <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley36.gif\" border=\"0\">)</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS (9 yo) diagnosed with mild PDD-NOS and DD (6 yo) NT - but definitely a challenge!</div>'

He prefers to be off by himself.</P> <P>This year an EXCELLENT SPED teacher did one and what a DIFFERENCE! She identified several causes of his behavior including task avoidance (frustration because he couldn\'t do it), control of the environment, too much stimulation, someone looking at him head on and directing him, and a few others including one where it seems internal and there is no antecedent that could be determined at that time (although over time we feel confident we\'ll figure it out). </P> <P>This resulted in a BIP that is JUST wonderful! Some of the strategies they use now include the use of visual schedules all over the place, a choice board, an IF/THEN board, NOT directing him head on but slightly off to the side-and NOT requiring direct eye contact when they direct him, allowing him a quiet place right outside the classroom door if he is over stimulated (its a different set up because they have their own little campus so he can\'t get away and they assign an aide to stand away from him and keep an eye), using some of the Collaborative problem solving techniques (The Explosive Child booK), He is also on a token economy with a \"store\"-although this doesn\'t work the greatest. </P> <P>When the other teacher/school said it was all about attention ALL they did was time out.

'<P>I do a mixture - 2 of my children attend school, and two are homeschooled. All are different in their needs and requirements. I deal with dyslexia and Aspergers (those two are homeschooled) and ADHD/anxiety issues and a preschooler who is autistic (those two are in school, with one in a developmental preschool and other therapies provided through an autism center here). </P> <P>We use a very eclectic approach for homeschooling since the needs of each child is different. Because my children vary in ages (17, 12, 9 and 4), we use a lot of unit studies where they can all work together as well as independently on multiple levels. Although my dyslexic can read, it takes her twice as long to learn the information - once to read it, and once to process its content. So...we\'ve used Switched on Schoolhouse, which allows for a narrator and multimedia presentations, classical literature taught via a course that included movies and indepth discussions of the plot, etc., manipulatives for math (Yea Math-U-See!), and hands-on for science. She\'s now working at college-level on many subjects, and scheduled to \"graduate\" from her remaining high school studies this year. She\'s also maintains a job.</P> <P>My daughter with Aspergers we\'ve done the same way, determining which study method works best for what subject for her. She\'s excelling in science, and working toward being a veterinarian, so we also have her working with a farrier and small animal vet for practical experience.</P> <P>My youngest daughter, who is in the school system, will more than likely be pulled out at the end of next year. I homeschooled her for a year, but found that she created major distractions for my other two, and required a more structured environment than we had at home, so she went back into public school. She\'s continued to work on material at home, however, so is working ahead of her peers at school. My son I\'ll bring home within the next two years if it is determined he thrives and learns more at home than he is in the system (which will probably be the case). Right now, however, he is in a terrific program which has helped him progress enormously with his language and social skills, and uses a variety of therapies, so he is better attending there than us attempting it all at home.</P> <P>And yes, I like homeschoolblogger!

Teachers in most private schools do not have to hold a state teaching liscence. So I am curious as to what kind of sp ed teaching she has done in the past. That being said, you are right, no one at that school probably has any knowledge in anything that is appropriate for your son.

In my opinion, other than sending your child to a special school that specializes in ASD, your best option for getting the educational services your son needs is public education. I know you say you pay your own therapist. And I think it\'s great you have the money to do so. But I would at least visit your public school that he would attend, see what they have to offer, listen to them, and then make the decesion. Don\'t make the decesion not to utilize public education only because you know they are in a financial upset right now. I know sometimes it does, but it should not have anything to do with your son getting his free and APPROPRIATE public educaiton. You might be surprised at what they can offer. But good luck no matter what you decide. And please understand that I am in no way trying to persuade you one way or the other.

'<P>In IL, when kids are put into self containted classrooms, the ED kids are kept completely separate from the ASD kids because of very different needs. My son is in a mixed class (the mix being mild ASD, severe ADHD, severe speech language impairment &amp; mild MR).

(A child who manifests the characteristics of autism after age 3 could be diagnosed as having autism if the other criteria of this Section are satisfied.) Other characteristics often associated with autism are engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped movements, resistance to environmental change or change in daily routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences. The term does not apply if a child&#146;s educational performance is adversely affected primarily because the child has an emotional disturbance.</P> <P><strong>Emotional Disturbance</strong> (includes schizophrenia but does not apply to children who are socially maladjusted, unless it is determined that they have an emotional disturbance) means a condition exhibiting one or more of the following characteristics over a long period of time and to a marked degree that adversely affects a child&#146;s educational performance: </P> <UL> <LI>An inability to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory, or health factors; <LI>An inability to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships with peers and teachers; <LI>Inappropriate types of behavior or feelings under normal circumstances; <LI>A general pervasive mood of anxiety or unhappiness or depression; or <LI>A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated with personal or school problems. </LI></UL> <P>In our school district the specific services are definitely individualized toward the child, but when it comes to class makeup, the disability category your child has would definitely determine which classroom your child would be in. And as we know, classroom = peer group = role models = potential friends.</P> <P>I think it can only be in your best interest to assure that your child\'s disability category is accurate.</P> <P> </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Kristy  Mom to 10 year old twin boys (1 PDD-NOS, 1 ADHD)</div>'

A risk of homogeneous age grouping is that some children will become acutely aware of failing to live up to normative expectations for behavior and achievement for their age. Risks of mixedage grouping are those of younger children becoming burdens to older ones and being overwhelmed by more competent classmates. Teachers must keep in mind the risk of overlooking older and more experienced children\'s need for challenge, but this is the case in every class, even when student age is not a factor. Research on mixedage grouping suggests that in spite of its risks, its potential advantages outweigh its disadvantages (Katz et al.,1990).</P> <P>This publication was funded by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement, U.S. Department of Education, under contract no.

'The opposite. Mas flourished in ABA.

It is temporary until he adjusts to the change. He also pushes therapist MUCH more than he will me. I feel terrible for some of them. Not all, but some. <img src=\"smileys/smiley2.gif\" border=\"0\"> The difference is, the good ones know what is going on and accept it and roll with it, the not so great ones act like I have a demon child and that working with him is an ordeal, those are the ones I don\'t mind him showing his stubborn side to, it is a good lesson for them.... I am certain that my son isn\'t the only child on the spectrum that is going to behave this way!<br>'
'<P>Yes. Get an advocate. Each state is required to give parents advocacy help. I states CLEARLY in Federal law that each child has a right to LRE - that means the LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT. Your son is currently in a very restrictive environment. If the only thing that is standing between him and accessing a higher functioning classroom, the District is REQUIRED to provide a one-on-one aide as part of his \"support services.\" If you want to find out more about special ed law, go to <A href=\"http://www.wrightslaw.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.wrightslaw.com</A> and click on IDEA. That is the Federal law that gives your son rights. Each state also must have a law that protects your son, but IDEA determines the MINIMUM each state MUST provide. Individual states can choose to provide more, so try to access your state\'s law through your Education Dept.</P> <P>You and your husband are totally correct. If the school refused to put an aide on your son\'s IEP, threaten to take them to a hearing. The will lose and spend more money on the hearing than they would have spent on a year\'s salary for the aide.</P>'
'<P>Nikolas is in an autism program at school and out of the 30 kids only 2 are being held back. One should be in kinder next year but his mom decided to keep him preschool one more year, he has a summer birthday, and the other should be in the 2nd grade and he is being held back with the 1st graders. Both of these boys are completely nonverbal and have a lot of physical issues, they are severaly effected by autism along with other things. So the parents along with the IEP team made the decision. Alot of that was also based on wanting to keep them with their same teachers one more year. It sounds to me like he is where he should be for kindergarten, I wouldn\'t hold him back just because everyone else does or because others think that is the right thing to do, I agree with woodsman, its a decision to be made by you and the school. He will adjust to the full day, my boys were definitely ready for it their last year of preschool. No I don\'t think its the norm, at least it isn\'t in my school. </P> <P>ETA: Nikolas is actually going to be put in with the ADS 1st graders next year although he should be in kindergarten. This was to keep him with the same teacher one more year (they are redoing the program, getting more kids and more teachers) who already knows him, keep him and his brother in seperate classes, and because he is in a pre-k/kinder class now and is academically the highest in the class, so he is academically ahead of the kids that will be 1st graders next year. He is also emotionally and socially equal to these kids, he wouldn\'t be to neurotypical kids, but to these kids he is even though he is younger. Behaviorally he is the best behaved in the class, although I wouldn\'t be saying that if he was in a mainstream kinder calss. So in his case not only is he not being held back, he is being moved up a grade.</P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Linda11567 on June 10 2008 at 5:14pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Linda, Mommy to 7 y.o. twins, Nikolas pdd-nos and Andrew, SID and apraxia and Ember, NT, 5 years old</div>'

'i think they know they are different and need to be told why. can be told about autism very simply depending on age. hard for them if they are aware they are different and they don\'t understand why.'
'The proof is in the pudding. If our children are meeting their IEP goals and the IEP goals are appropriate, then the setting is appropriate. Of course, in order to get our children into the right placement, it\'s probably critical to go LOOK at the class while it\'s in session. We parents can figure out a lot about how appropriate a particular class is based on our intimate understanding of our children and how they react to certain environments. If a child is not learning or if a child is having meltdowns because of the stress, that environment is most likely not appropriate. I\'ve been visiting each new class for my DS for the past 10 years. And my instincts have never failed me.'
'Sorry - I thought you did - I was reading this early, before my caffeine hit. If you have any feeling that your child is on the spectrum (add/adhd is almost universal in kids on the spectrum, but that dx can stand alone, too), my advice to do the assessment at childbriain stands.'
'My ds is in a public school wich supposedly means a \'free and <br />appropriate\' education. I got a letter yesterday saying that they request a <br />minimum $50 \'pledge\' per month from every family. People not being <br />able to pledge were told to contact the school ! Apart from they also <br />hold a number of fundraisers. <br />While I realize that schools are hurting (a whole nother topic) I was really <br />put off by this pressure tactic. We do not have extra money laying around <br />but we will cough up the extra $50 because as a parent of a special ed <br />kid there is more pressure to be a \'team player parent\' as it is. <br />I complained about this to a friend in CA and she said her public school <br />requests a monthly pledge of $200.

'Let me just say that an ED classroom is the worst possible placement for your daughter. Are you happy with the school, in general? Have you asked for a new IEP, now that you have an Asperger\'s diagnosis? You need to find a school for her where the IEP team, and teachers are willing to work \"outside the box\", in order to create the best possible program. Aspies are tricky to educate: Usually of gifted intelligence, but learning and socially disabled, with more than a few quirks thrown in for good measure. Does she have an aide? If not, this would be something to bring up at the IEP, because I\'m sure that she has organizational issues that will only get worse once she starts middle school without the proper support in place.

It can\'t just be an ED placement - there has to be something else! I too feel that is not an appropriate placement for kids on the spectrum - the kids in ED have different issues. But, like tzoya said - you can\'t get water out of stone and I just think from what you have said - they\'re just not capable of giving much more. They just don\'t \"get it\" or just don\'t want to.

'maybe convince them that this behavior is due to ASD. It has been documented children with ASD have problems with transition, and are capable to do something one day and not another. for instance \" how was her morning going, was your DD upset about anything before school that day. did something happen after at school in the morning, someting even small can play havic with an ASD child\'s mood and feelings about what they can do that day. Even if you cannot pin point to something that put her a litlle off that day, she might of just needed to have that person for comfort reasons (fears about halllway that certain day) There is so much that could have triggered a child to do something one day and not another, but the fact remaines this is a ASD thing. I think you need a plan with a goal of her doing it by herself in the future. I would ask for a meeting to discuss her transistional plans thought her day. Transition\'s for us have been someting we have had to make plan for and then slowley wean him off of them, using rewards and certain people for him to contact with. Does she get any reward for doing something that is very difficult for a child with ASD. Also I think she needs someone all the time during transitions until a plan for weaning her form that person is in place, for safty reasons also. rewards can be something she likes, it does not have to be a candy treat just something that will motavate her. They could also every so often have her and a peer or aide take a note to the office or run an errand so she will have time to get used to being in hallways with someone with her for now, built up her confidance about being in hallway, so she knows it\'s an okay place to be. Your meeting does not have to be an IEP meeting unless you want this included in her IEP goal\'s which sometimes is a good idea. Have some information with you to explain why ASD can cause problems with transitions, and you would like to come up with a plan to follow and see if it helps. Share your idea\'s on what you think would or could help, and see what they say. Sometimes I ask if we can try someting for a decient amout of time, like 6 weeks before we have another meeting to discuss how the plan is working. unless they have concerns before that time to call you, your always open to new ideas. One other thing does she like the class she is transitioning to? This could also be a trigger, if she is having anxiety about other class this is also a reason to have a plan, or a person until it is figured out why she can sometimes and not others. She is so young and has ASD I think you have valid reasons why this is not manipulation. <br><br>If you remember my son was refusing to go to school this year. <br>we worked out a plan with school and have progress, it has taken some time, but it is working. Forcing my son to change has never worked, there is always more to it than meets the eye with a child that ASD especially the eyes at school. Also when we use a method that works for children with Autism we have sucess. <br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- mom to 13 year old boy with aspergers</div>'

I would use the information that they gave you and <br />agree that he is not progressing and that placement was not appropriate <br />for him as he did not have adequate supports in class. Just tell them that <br />he needs 1:1 ABA so he can learn the skills and be able to generalize in <br />the classroom. TEll them that putting him a more affected classroom <br />would be the most restrictive placement for your son. ( check on this but <br />by law, they need to offer the least restrictive placement for your son) <br /> <br />As for your little guy, what can I say.

I can understand his father\'s worrying about your ds\'s self-confidence, but his confidence may be low anyway if he\'s feeling bad about not fitting in with the crowd (especially as he approaches his teen years) and it may help to give him a reason why... and take the opportunity to tell him how special he is as well! <img src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Kellie  Mommy to Luke (autism, 7 yrs) & Andrew (5 yr) & Alyssa (3 yrs)</div>'
'Also, something VERY important. If a school district can show that parents have not gone to an IEP meeting, they are able to claim (in front of the Hearing Office, should there be a Hearing) that \"the parent didn\'t cooperate.\" You NEVER want that to happen. If you want to see data, it is your right to have that data printed out and sent to you (under FERPA - search that here and on Wrightslaw). They can charge you up to 25 cents a page, but they HAVE to give it to you - no meeting necessary. However, they may legitimately want to explain the data to you. That\'s fine. Call and ask if the meeting is only to go over the data. If they say yes, then tell them to just send it to you or arrange a meeting with the people who TOOK the data so that they can explain it to you privately. Do all of this in writing so that they cannot say you didn\'t cooperate.'
'I\'ve thought about that after learning about the possibility in that training I attended. Only problem is I still have a little one at home, which would make it hard to attend meetings (having to make arrangements for him). It\'s a definite possibility for when he enters full day pre-k in two years. I think my other son will be part of special education for a long time yet, so I just may be sitting in those meetings some day learning and sharing with others.

I did not want to get you anymore upset than you already are with my post. This is so beyond being wicked and unprofessional. If what the teachers and prinicipal say is true. That is so uncalled for. I definitely would do all the suggested actions. And in addition find a way to let Mason understand that mom will protect him and not let that happen again. How has the Sp Ed teacher been with him before? Does she collaborate with him or antagonize him? My ds acts different with people depending on how they treat him. He can tell when someone does not like him so his ugly side comes out more. This is part of what scares me the most about autism. Being misunderstood by law enforcement is a big danger to our kids.

'Duration and frequency are separate issues. One whole hour does not necessarily equal two half hours. Most kids do better with shorter duration and more frequency. Whatever speech your daughter gets, make certain her present levels of performance are measured NOW, using a standardized test of some kind. Then ask for another such test at the end of the year. If she has not made at least one year\'s progress, the school needs to give her more speech.'

'<P>They HAVE denied him FAPE if they are not following his IEP. ALso, they are in direct violation of Federal law if they have not included the parents in the decision for placement. Period. You can keep your child in ANY placement by claiming pendency (stay put) and taking your district to a hearing. If your child is on half days, they are denying him and education and ANY hearing officer in ANY state will come down HARD on the District for this. If you cannot afford an attorney or an advocate, go to the hearing yourself. The Hearing Officer will most likely feel some sympathy that you are not represented and give you leeway to present as a lay person would. </P> <P>In the meantime, ask for all kinds of evaluations on your son. The district cannot refuse to do them. Once they come back, refuse to accept their results and demand an Independent Educational Evaluation for each test. The district HAS to pay for all these tests given by the professional of your choice. This will start to cost them TONS because if they don\'t choose to pay, the law requires that THEY bring you to a hearing. Once THEY are the ones who call the hearing (which they are required to do if they deny you even one IEE) THEY will be the ones who will have to PROVE that they are in the right. Not you. You will then at least get in front of a Hearing Officer and be able to tell your story and have the HEARING OFFICER order the school district to fix this illegal situation. </P> <P>If you think your son is getting gypped, you are RIGHT. But the ONLY way to fight such gross misconduct is through the legal system. District who behave this way do not have the child\'s best interest in mind, only their own. And their own best interests are threatened when they get into the legal system. Perhaps someone in Ohio can point you in the direction of getting the free advocacy advice that EVERY state is required to offer. Or you can study up on the law yourself and figure out how to put the District\'s feet to the fire. All I can tell you at this point is what you already know. The District is behaving illegally (just the fact that they have kept you out of the loop and unilaterally placed your son in a situation you don\'t want him in and also have denied him half a day\'s education is WAY bad) and the ONLY way to get them to behave legally is to take them to a hearing. There really is no other solution with a District that clearly does NOT want to do the right thing.</P>'

I am not sure what your childs needs are - all of our kids have social skills needs and higher functioning kids can often proffit from having some or full inclusion in a mainstream program. If your kid is working on functional skills and would be too stressed in a mainstream program it is more important to look what each school offers in their settings. Where I live for example, the asd resource room does not have access to an academic curriculum, meaning that the child will only work on functional skills or whatever skills are on the IEPduring their time in there even if they could follow the mainstream academic curriculum.

They will fight and buck like there was no tomorow, because they no longer have control of the situation. This program SAVED our son\'s life, under similar if not worse circumstances. The district cannot oppose the recommendation of a private psychiatrist in this matter, and the placement will be good until your doctor indicates otherwise. Assuming your laws are similar in this regards to our\'s here in San Diego.</P> <P>IMO your son is in grave danger. Do not wait like we did until it\'s too late. I see a lot of Cody in Jared, and one of the most striking and common features, is Anxiety related stresses, which are punished, thus creating an unstable and dangerous downward spiral. Get your son into the home hospital program and out of that hell hole they call a school. After that, you will know your son is safe, and they can no longer abuse the daylights out of him. Their strategy is almost certainly to force you to remove him from school so they don\'t have to pay. </P> <P>If you want to see where this kind of abuse can lead, take a gander at what happened to our son.

'I don\'t have time to respond in detail right now, but if I were you, I\'d call an IEP meeting and request an autism consultant. Also, request ABA hours. The parents can object to all of this, but at least you will have gotten the two most important supports on the table. Also, ask that teacher training be formally included in the IEP. What state do you teach in? Each state has different laws covering special education, but EVERY state has to follow Federal Law (IDEA).

ETA: Meaning we not only didn\'t get the extra services (speech) we were hoping to, but we were not longer even allowed to stay in the class. (It was actually all the other parents in the class who were panicking at the time, as the SLP was no longer going to be teaching the class-how ironic, *I* was the calm one, and *we* got booted... <img src=\"smileys/smiley2.gif\" border=\"0\"> )<br><br>It was probably partly a coincidence for you-your son was ready-plus of course, being calm and non-defensive can only help. I find services run much more on a funds-available basis than a \"this parent did her homework\" basis. But either way, huge congratulations to you guys-this is a great step for your little guy! Let us know how his first day went.<br><br>(Edit) Let me add...I\'m not discounting the work you\'ve done or saying that it hasn\'t had any influence. But the fact that your son and others started getting these services at the same time might mean that these parents whom you see as underinvolved or undereducated on their resources might not actually be. It\'s just as likely that they have been fighting for their children\'s rights and for services as well, just maybe quietly, and without discussing it with others. I definitely don\'t discuss all my research and the details of my IEPs with other parents. So I\'m just saying...don\'t be too quick to judge other parents. And at the same time, yes, it\'s great that you\'re keeping up with things-everything we as parents do and know helps bit by bit. From the amount of parents I\'ve met IRL and online, I think there might be more educated parents than you think. ;)<br><br>Again, congratulations to you guys and let us know how it goes. <br><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by MyDearColin on January 29 2008 at 1:36pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>-    C: 5; autism  E: 2; very mild speech delay</div>'

'<P>If I am reading your post correctly, </P> <P>Basically your child is considered a typical peer and a placement decision is not required to be placed into an inclusion or general ed classroom. Do you think that they asked all the parents of \"typical\" children if they wanted to be in the inclusion class? I doubt they did. The school probably just assigned the children as they would for any class. Parents are typically not involved in class assignment. Do you know any of the students who have this class this year? I find out the best info from other parents. </P> <P> I would request again to see the class and even offer to volunteer. Talk to the principal. I would want to know how many students with disabilities will be in the class and will the special ed teacher be in the room full time. Remember that the class will be different next year as this group of students is promoted to the next grade. My son is in an inclusion class and the sped teacher helps all students even if the students are not formally identified. My son is NOT singled out and nobody knows he is one of the reasons the SPED teacher comes to the class. In our case the SPED teacher is only in the room for writing ( my son weakness).</P> <P>I think you actually need to request an IEE (independent educational eval) because it sounds like from your prior posts the school psychologist does not know her head from 1st base. Your DD should have an IEP if only for social/emotional reasons.</P> <P>I am so sorry you are having such a problem with the school.</P>'
'JanisA-<br><br>RE: the tour of the building. Did you call the principal of the school directly and ask if you could \"introduce yourself and your child\" and take a look around the building? Most principals can\'t rationally say no to meeting a child and parent. You can also say you will be on vacation during orientation and don\'t want your son to start school w/o getting his bearings. Our school has an amazing knack for planning summer orientations while we are out of town. The more hardcore approach is to call the director of special ed. and request a tour, but if you don\'t want to emphasize your son\'s classification, that\'s not a good plan.<br><br>As for getting him off to a good start, I call a meeting with my son\'s teachers every year to discuss his learning style, strengths and weaknesses. Any parent should be permitted to do that whether their kid is ASD or NT. You might feel better if you do that and the teachers would start off with good information-always an advantage. High school teachers tend to be more product than process oriented because they have to get the kids ready to pass so many standardized tests. At a meeting, they can communicate their expectations to you and you can see if they are realistic for Keith and watch throughout the school year to see if he is meeting them. (Suppose you have a teacher who takes off for sloppy handwriting, for example?) In having a dialogue with the teachers, you can bring up the IEP just to reinforce it, briefly. Legally, they have to follow it and will be informed of it anyway. Where I teach, you are not supposed to have any instructional contact with a classified child until after you are made aware of the IEP on the first day of school. Teachers should not mention a kid\'s classification to other children and your son certainly doesn\'t have to bring it up to his peers. Some kids will figure it out anyway just because they will notice that certain people get certain services or have interaction with a certain special ed teacher.<br><br>Jake starts high school this year, too.

'<P>A medical diagnosis gives your son one part of what\'s required for an IEP and all that is required for a 504 - a disability. A classification under an IEP is only possible if his disability is preventing him from accessing an education. And the school district is right - he has to meet the definition under the law. You might want to access California\'s definition (you can do this online or write to your State Ed Dept. for it) and ask that the doctor write a report that includes the sort of language in the definition to describe his diagnosis. </P> <P>If your son is having difficulty with academics, functional skills or behaviors, there are ways to test for these things and to show that he needs an IEP. It\'s then incumbent on the IEP Team to see WHICH DEFINITION fits the symptoms. Oftentimes, parents are successful if there\'s a comorbit diagnosis of ADHD because that can qualify him for a classification of Other Health Impaired. Once he\'s classified, the definition matters much less. The IEP must address his INDIVIDUAL needs.</P> <P>Go to <A href=\"http://www.wrightslaw.coma\" target=\"_blank\">www.wrightslaw.coma</A> and search \"definition of autism\" and you\'ll get the Federal definition.

'It is my understanding, that every time the school district does a formal assessment such as a triennial, the parent may request an IEE if they disagree with the results. Last school year, my dd\'s school district sent her to the Diagnostic Center, which is a division of the office of education. This was the the district\'s idea not mine. I did not agree with the Dx Center\'s Eval and took my dd to a private assessment at my own expense. This school year when I presented my assessment results to the school IEP team they decided they wanted to do her triennial a year early and do their own pscyhoeducation evaluation. <br><br>Their psychoeducation evaluation says my dd is only language delayed and not on the spectrum. Of course I disagree with their evaluation and requested an IEE. They denied my request for an IEE, in part citing that evaluation they had done by the DX center last year. I don\'t think they should be able to cite that as a reason for denial, as that was last year and had nothing to do with their triennial evaluation they did this year? <br><br>Is my line of reasoning correct? <br>'

'I know that ABA programs can be really strict about what they will do and what they won\'t do. Do they have a school psycholgist? Speak to that person about this. You might also want to ask for an FBA to make SURE of what the reason for the outbursts are. Write a letter to the adminstrator outlining your feelings and your proposed solution. If you are definitely against medication at this point, state that. If they KNOW you will not medicate your son right now, they may be more willing to try your other solutions. BTW, anti anxiety meds (and there are many) CAN work wonders. Your son is pretty young yet, but when he gets older and the hormones kick in, sometimes the anxiety can come from nothing apparent and the meds can work wonders. If you can\'t convince the school to do things your way, let them do things THEIR way and live with the consequences unless you see DS bringing this frustration home. Then call a team meeting and tape record it.'
'I am wondering what you all would do in this situation. We have moved <br />to a new state and district and things have gone downhill very quickly. <br /> <br />The school put my dd in a self-contained \'autism program\', which she <br />has not like from day one. She asks all the time to leave and knows she <br />does not belong there. The school interpreted her IEP that stated she was <br />in a self-contained environment and this was closest they could come, <br />though she does not fit the profile. <br /> <br />It took an emergency meeting with me and an advocate to get the school <br />to give her a 2nd grade teacher (as was required in her IEP and grade <br />level work). They also did not have her FBA and BIP and didn\'t even <br />realize until questioned by the advocate. They also underestimated her <br />minutes in gen. ed. <br /> <br />I will say the school was cooperative once we realized the minutes were <br />under, and they also put her in at a better time (in the am to start <br />instead of the afternoon in the middle of a lesson). <br /> <br />However, I don\'t find her gen. ed classroom teacher to be that enthused <br />about having her in class, and her teaching style is pretty traditional with <br />lots of seatwork. There are 7 second grade classes, I don\'t know if the <br />school would let me observe them all but I don\'t believe her method fits <br />Sarah\'s learning style. <br /> <br />Now I\'ve seen some of her tests scores and they are not great. I\'ve asked <br />that instead of the autism room (where most of the time she won\'t work), <br />that she be sent to the resource room to get extra help. No more autism <br />room. I\'m not sure if they will go for that. They didn\'t even show me the <br />tests until I asked. <br /> <br />My question is, I just don\'t know if it\'s worth fighting to fix all this. She <br />really thrived in her last school and here it\'s just not the same. There is <br />less of an open and collaborative ethic. <br /> <br />I\'m thinking maybe I should home school, and stop fighting. She really <br />doesn\'t like school anymore (partly because she misses her old teachers <br />with whom she had a really great relationship. Thanks if you\'ve read this <br />far.

'<P>About four months ago our neighbors decided to get a pitbull. When it was a puppy we didn\'t have a concern, but then the dog got bigger and was able to leap above the 4 ft fence. My H is extremely afraid of dogs because he was attacked by one at a young age. I was also attacked by a collie when I was 6, but I had dogs my whole life and new how to deal with them. Anyways, I initially spoke with my neighbor (she\'s hispanic, so she has limited english)and told her how the majority of our summer has been spent indoors because the kids can\'t even go in the backyard to play anymore. She said the dog wouldn\'t hurt the kids, and that we are just being \"afraid\" for nothing. SURE, like you don\'t see hundreds of stories in the newspaper and on tv about Pitbull attacks. Sorry, but my children\'s safety comes first. It got so bad that my husband started to go to and from the garage with tools in his hand in fear that he\'d be attacked. Anyways, I spoke with the village and they did come out and told them they needed a higher fence, which they are \"slowly\" building on their own. Now this morning I see under their \"Beware of dog \" sign , it now has another sign attached that says \"beware of humans...signed lola\", the name of the dog. </P> <P>Why do neighbors have to be so stupid sometimes??

'<P>tzoya - thanks for the info. we are trying to move. we\'ve had the house on the market for 18 months now.</P> <P>i also spoke to one of the attorneys you listed today. Very knowledgeable. The lastest is that the school district has now retained counsel. The school district is now trying to force me to have another IEP - we just had one 4 weeks ago. It was determined at that time that my son did not need special ed services - everyone agreed that he would be better served with 504. I signed IEP refusing services in lue of 504 accommodations. School district screwed up because since my son is 504 they do not have grounds to dismiss him without facing a discrimination suit. But now they are telling me that they now have new IEP forms for me to sign and asked me to come in asap for emergency IEP meeting. I declined because I said I was happy with current accommodations. Special ed director calls me back and states that she was told to call me and insist that I choose one of the first three days back after the holidays for an IEP meeting. This was msg left on my answering machine. I know that what they are trying to do is say that he needs services so they have grounds to dismiss. But I\'m being told that I can still reject the services, opt for the continuation of his 504 and if necessary request an IDEA meeting to determine that he does not need special services and therefore not under IDEA. At the very least it would stop the dismissal process and get my son through his school year. The new teacher he is suppose to begin with in new year is great and I see no reason to change that -this is my barometer for continuing, as long as this does not affect my son and he is happy I intend to fight for him to stay - if he is not then he\'s out.</P> <P>Any thoughts?</P> <P> </P>'

'<P>The other states DO have nearly the same services as NY does, starting at age 3. There are two things unique to NY, but they don\'t kick in until a child is classified Autistic, which can\'t happen in NY until kindergarten (before that ALL preschool kids are classified \"a preschool child with a disability\") If your child has an educational label of Autism, in NYS that child is guaranteed DAILY speech therapy. ALso, if he is being educated in a classroom that is not SPECIFICALLY for autistic kids, the services of an Autism Consultant can be written into his IEP. Also, parents are guaranteed parent training. But, otherwise, kids in NYS get just what kids get everywhere. What a particular child gets is in direct proportion to how well his parents can advocate. And the deck is getting more and more stacked against parents because of recent US Supreme Court decisions. That means it\'s more and more important to know how to advocate for our kids - or to pay someone to do it for us. One of the greatest forces that stop good advocacy is the feeling that so many of us moms have that we have to be NICE. Of course, it\'s always vital to act professionally, but to tell the District EXACTLY what our children need, who is helping our kids - and who isn\'t - and learning every single thing we can about the law is not \"not being nice.\" It\'s being an excellent advocate. So, if you advocate properly, all the things we get in NYS CAN be gotten elsewhere. </P> <P>One thing that is now different in NY is that insurance companies HAVE to provide services for autism. Some other states have this, too. But no one is every REQUIRED to use their health insurance to cover services that ought to be provided by the schools. </P>'

God my parents had to fight my school quite a bit, i remember the battles, districts can be difficult to deal with and I certainly learned at a very early age that the school admins dont always have what is best for the kids in mind, at least some kids anyways. They can be extreamly self centered and I definatly think whether they try or not target certain kids and just wont deal with them and I feel I was certainly one of those kids back in the day. <br /> <br />I can tell you a few stories that were terribly corrupt on their part. Granted my behavior was not exactly that of a model student, but it seemed the admin almost retaliated against me and my parents, to a degree. Basicly to try and do what they could to get rid of me, suspend me or even send me to another school, they failed only cause mom and dad fought hard, and I definatly feel while a punishment was warrented towards me for my bad behavior (and fortunatly I had an awsome spec ed teacher who stepped in as a kinda lawyer so I had help whenever I was in trouble) but the punishment they dished out was completly unfair, mom and dad settled on that punishment in exchange for no suspension only because they lied and their was nothing I could do. <br /> <br />This is the world we live in, and I know you have had difficulties with schools in the past. Perhapse like I did when I was 9-10 Mason also has a kinda reputation with them. Now they dont want to deal with him or you and so their punishments will be extream for anything he does and I would not be surprised if they lie about things. <br /> <br />I really wish ya the best of luck with these people, and I think you may have a battle to fight with these people. Seems they are going a little overboard with punishments as is thats a fact right?! I just hope its not something more deeper like them screweing with ya. <br /> <br />I would be upset if I was Mason too, and back in the day I was when things were happening. Mason and I both have a reputation, but the reasons why we have a reputation with the school are very different. These are different times, and I think Mason has it much tougher then I ever did at that age, and even older. Good luck!!<div class=\'post_sig\'>- DX\'ed with HFA as a child.

'<P>Lila,</P> <P>The \"who works on goals\" question you posed is a good one.</P> <P>My son sees, throughout the week, the following folks: his 1:1 aide, speech therapist, occupational therapist, social worker, school psychologist and learning specialist. The learning specialist is also known as the \"resource room\" person. All of them work on his goals with him.</P> <P>Each Monday morning from 8:00 - 8:30, this entire group meets, plus the classroom teacher, plus me &amp; hubby when he can. At least 50% of the time the principal sits in as well. The whole purpose of the meeting is to talk about C: what\'s working, what\'s not working, what\'s coming up this week that might need a social story or an adaptation. I also let them know of anything at home that might impact C\'s performance at school (i.e. dh being out of town for work, a cold, etc.) While the classroom teacher is aware of C\'s goals, she does not specifically work on them with him, though she does provide input as to his performance in the classroom and how she sees him doing against the standard kindergarten benchmarks.</P> <P>Last year, when we made the decision (we being the entire team, which is everyone mentioned above) to put C in mainstream K with all of these supports, we also discussed the self-contained option. At that time we all agreed this would be the best placement. For next year, we all agree a self-contained placement would be better for a variety of reasons.</P> <P>One thing to note is that while services such as minutes of speech/month and minutes of OT/month should not vary whether a child is in a special class or a mainstream class, the delivery of those services may vary. In a mainstream class, all services tend to be \"pull out\" - i.e., your child is taken out of the room, away from his peers, to meet with a SLP in a separate room. The benefit is the 1:1 attention, the drawback is that everytime your child is taken out of the classroom he loses opportunities to work on social skills, which are equally critical. In a special education classroom, many of the services tend to be \"push in.\" For example, in the class C will be in next year, the SLP comes into the classroom and works with groups of kids together and the speech is more tightly integrated into the curriculum.</P> <P>On the aide issue, I\'m glad we tried it this year but my son definitely gets too dependent on his aide to keep him on task. He\'s also pulled out a lot for his services, which is a lot of transitions. This is why we\'re going self-contained class (w/ mainstream for art, PE, recess &amp; lunch) for 1st grade - we want to see a greater level of independent functioning. We all agree that the self-contained class is actually less restrictive than the mainstream at this time.</P> <P>I know it\'s alot to think about. Getting the book Tzoya recommends helps alot. Unfortunately, we\'re the only ones that we can be sure are putting our child\'s needs first, and we\'re forced to become advocates whether it\'s what we think is right or not. I agree that I\'d hire a pro since time is of the essence.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Kristy  Mom to 10 year old twin boys (1 PDD-NOS, 1 ADHD)</div>'

His IQ score was 88, a little lower than i expected (hes so smart, mainly in science), but thats fine .it was the DX of auditory processing disorder and semantic-pragmatic disorder im confused about.

'<P>I dont know what a core evaluation is?</P> <P>DS has a preschool evaluation done that tested language, social emotional and not sure about academics but probably,? I asked them for it right after he was dxed (with pdd-nos at the time) and they did it no problem and my son cooperated very well.</P> <P>His developmental pedi did his iq test and he cooperated extremely well. In kindergarten i had to fight to get any testing done it was literally a nightmare and thats an understatement. We finally got testing in academics, social emotional, autism, OT, speech, adaptive behaviors, fba etc. and it showed he needed an iep and related services. He did ok with the testing tho he doesnt test well with someone he doesnt know so they took thier time letting him warm up or spending time with him first.</P> <P>He got more autism testing and speech testing just recently in 1st grade and were awaiting the results. They didnt resist testing him very much because they were having problems in class. As far as i know he did well tho his teachers have said he needs too much prompting to do normal everyday things and attnetion span is very small and hes phasing out all day or tired falls asleep in class so testing was alitle harder. </P> <P>He got testing from ss last month and fell asleep twice and i havnt seen the results of it yet but it was a cognitive/iq test and academic testing as well. </P> <P>i didnt know if the question was if we have trouble getting the tests from the school or having our kids cooperate with the testing so i said both!

'You can have a COMMUNICATION BOOK written into your child\'s IEP if necessary. The LAW says that parent of special ed student MUST be informed about their progress as often as the parents of general ed kids are. That usually means every 6 to 10 weeks, at report card time. It means that your child should be getting both a typical report card and a report that tells you about his progress toward his IEP goals. A COMMUNICATION BOOK is a book that you send in every day in his backpack. You can write things there you want teachers and staff to know about and they can write you back. I have dozens of these notebooks saved from 1993 when my son entered preschool. He\'s in HS now and we STILL do this (he\'s in a special ed vocational HS, so there is no embarassment involved). An alternative to a notebook is to send in daily (or weekly) checklists of what your child does or doesn\'t do. You can also ask the teachers and therapists for a phone number at which they can be contacted or an email address. You DEFINITELY need to be in close touch.'
'SO glad to hear this. And, yes, anger can be an excellent tool. In fact, I used that today with a school on behalf of one of the families I help. VERY quickly, the school made up for their shenanigans. I got angry privately, with the IEP Chairperson and it worked. Righteous anger can work wonders when it\'s used sparingly. Hope the sped head rights things for your son. And remember that IF IT IS NOT IN WRITING, IT WASN\'T SAID.'
'<font size=\"2\"> <br />OK, I think I have posted this before, but I really feel the need to do it again tonight so bear with me. I suspect that at the very least someone will see this tonight who has not seen it yet... <br /> <br />THE SOCIAL PUZZLE <br /> <br />One of the signature characteristics of autism is that of social delay. As mentioned before I took a long time &#150; as in nearly 25 years &#150; to iron out the whole social thing. In fact, I am still learning. Unfortunately, I hear of many autistic adults dealing with depression because of their lack of socialization, myself included. I&#146;ve also talked to people who have turned to drugs in order to escape from their problems. Fortunately I have managed to remain drug free, but only out of fear. I doubt I would pass up the opportunity to escape if it weren&#146;t for all the horror stories I&#146;ve heard. Plus, now that I&#146;ve studied science, I can see that the horror stories have merit, so therefore my repulsion from these substances is increased. <br /> <br />The main thing that has kept me off of mind-altering substances, though, is fear of the unknown. I remain stable by staying in control of my \"world,\" which means being alert enough to stimuli that I can go into my \"mental database\" and pick the appropriate script fast enough to avoid looking dumb, getting injured, being in the wrong place at the wrong time, offending the people I\'m with, etc., etc.. Street drugs would take that alertness away from me and I would no longer be in control of my world, and thus no longer in control of my actions. The less in touch I am with my environment (due to prolonged stress/overload, some medications, or whatever), the more prominent my autistic tendencies become. I experience a lot of stress when I do something \"wrong,\" especially when I did not intend to do it. So it stands to reason that if I were on any kind of mind-altering drug, I would be even more out of touch, which means I would inadvertently do more wrong things, which means I would have even more guilt and anxiety around other people. Aside from that it could put me in trouble with the law, and since law enforcement procedures go on without allowing the suspect to know what\'s happening, it would add a perpetual \"unknown\" environmental condition that I would continuously stress over in addition to everything else. So looking at it from that angle it seems to me like turning to drugs will only magnify my current problem many times over. <br /> <br />I think my main crutch is that I have mainly \"acquaintances,\" not \"friends.\" In other words, I have certain protective barriers (\"firewalls\" if you will) about me that most people just can\'t get through. I never stay in social situations for very long, and I only go out often enough that people will see that I am willing to go out. All I really have to do is focus on not doing anything offensive, and then if I don\'t make much conversation the people around me seem to absorb the \"blame\" somewhat for not getting to know me in the brief time that they saw me. I have the ability to \"mimic\" the people around me and quickly learn to do enough to not appear the odd man out, provided I only make brief appearances. I usually do this by mimicking behaviors that I observe from members of the group. I just use my mental store of scripts to anticipate certain moments, then inject the scripted response when the opportune moment arrives. It\'s not always easy to do, but I only have to do that successfully a couple of times in order to appear \"normal\" to them, albeit quiet and reserved. Thus I am simply camouflaged or disguised from a social standpoint, rather than actually a genuine member of the clique. As long as I leave with a reputation something to the effect of \"that one guy Nick, I didn\'t get to talk to him much, and he didn\'t stay long, but he seemed cool....\" it puts the responsibility of being social on the other people, rather than me, because it makes them curious about me and interested in me. All I have to do then is not let them get quite close enough to see me up close, and I can hang with a group for a while. <br /> <br />Eventually, however, my quirks and oddities will begin to show up, people will stop greeting me, and the responsibility of being social will start to shift back to me. Once this happens I begin to withdraw, and at a certain point I will feel out of place enough that I will detach from that group of friends, be reclusive and collect my thoughts for a short period of time, and then when I feel ready or the opportunity presents itself, find another group to latch onto so that I can once again have a social \"luster\" about me. This cycle repeats about every 12-18 months. It sort of makes me a camouflaged social \"parasite,\" but it\'s the best I can do. <br /> <br />WHY IS THIS SYSTEM NECESSARY? OR IS IT? <br /> <br />It would be unfair of me to assume that the system I have described is necessary for anyone with my condition. However, the sacrifices that I have to make by using it are not as stressful to me as the anxiety that comes with messing up. I am not able to move past any kind of social \"unknown\" unless the person I encounter it in front of can be addressed in a way that brings closure to the issue. That closure usually involves some sort of conversation about what the person thinks of the \"unknown\" incident that has me hung up, so that I can enter it in my mental database and use it for further reference. When I use the word \"unknown\" here, what I am actually referring to is a social situation that I do not have a script for. When the situation is over, I am unsure of whether or not I handled it in an acceptable manner, and I cannot stop my mind from racing until I have found the answer. It becomes a mini-obsession for me and I can find it difficult to function until I can find a way to resolve the question. Because it can be difficult to resolve these types of questions without directly coming out and asking someone (generally considered a no-no), it can take a lot of time for me to manipulate conversations until I get the input that I need. This stress can be overwhelming to me, especially if the incident involves someone I happen to care a lot about. Thus, the most effective method I can come up with to minimize these episodes is to limit how dependent I am on social groups as well as keep my number of loved ones to a minimum. It\'s ironic that as badly as I want acceptance, I usually cannot accept acceptance because I cannot read the unwritten messages that other people convey, and thus I often cannot confirm acceptance to myself, even when it is present. <br /> <br />I think the main problem with autism in general, concerning this issue, is that we (I\'m going to say \"we\" instead of \"I\" because I have found this to be true with several other autistics, but these are my own experiences here) do not understand, or at best have difficulty understanding, the way people interact with us. There is a popular stereotype that goes something like \"they stay in their own little bubble and don\'t respond to the world around them.\" While it may be true that we appear to be in our own bubble, we certainly do respond to the environment around us. What we\'re missing is the ability to respond to the people around us. We are more than willing to love anyone who will devote their time to us. The problem is that the way people interact with one another does not make sense to us. We don\'t get it at all. But we want to be loved and understood, so it is very frustrating to say the wrong thing or do the wrong thing because it turns people away. And often, because inappropriate actions or words tend to come at the onset of a panic attack or meltdown (which is a very scary and stressful occurrence), it usually turns them away right when we need them the most. Thus, I personally do not have many close friends simply because I do not want to count on them for emotional support only have them leave me hanging because of something I accidentally caused. It\'s not that I don\'t want to be close to other people, it\'s just that it\'s obvious to me that it takes a certain kind of person to read what\'s going on with me, and it\'s not worth what I go through when I offend someone who can\'t. So I appear not to care, and I appear not to like being close to people, and I appear not to like being touched, hugged, and all that. Truth is that I do actually want all of those things, but it seems people can only get those things by correctly playing the social game, and since I am more or less inept in that department, I simply can\'t get involved without eventually looking inappropriate or strange to at least a few people &#150; usually more. <br /> <br />It wouldn\'t be so important to stay on the defensive if it weren\'t for the fact that people talk behind backs. And what they say about a person when he is not around will often affect the way they treat him afterward. When this treatment changes, NT people seem to be able to discern the reason simply by reading others. I figured that out as soon as I began to branch out on my own, and I\'ve been very quick to become reserved ever since. Problem is, I cannot read other people to discern the problem; I have to see it in black and white, which is not only a rare occurrence, but when it does happen, it usually does so with devastating consequences. That\'s because the \"black-and-white\" revelation usually comes as a culmination of me not getting the message over what is usually a long series of missed hints. In this case it is important to note that among NTs, missed hints often fuel the figurative fire. That means that when I do finally get the message, it usually comes with a bombardment of attached messages and/or consequences that I never would have anticipated. So once I sense that something is wrong, I will shut down because as long as I can tell that I\'m missing hints, all really I know is that I have no idea what will ultimately spew out when the issue finally does come to a head. And the last thing I want to do is make things worse than they are already perceived to be. <br /> <br />The bottom line is that if I am not aware of the factor that has caused others to change the way they treat me, I can\'t evaluate where I stand with them and so I am unable to open up. This is because I can quickly sense when the boundaries have suddenly changed (or become clearly defined) but I am often unable to discreetly become aware of where these boundaries are and why they have suddenly changed or solidified. Out of fear of unwittingly crossing these boundaries (or straying even farther outside of an unseen boundary that I have already crossed), I find myself afraid to move at all, and so I appear very closed off and reserved. I can and will come out of my shell if I feel safe (ask anyone who knows me well), but at the slightest sign of mistrust I withdraw, and won\'t open up again until the perceived \"threat\" is gone. And if I can\'t clearly communicate or discern what the perceived threat is without causing a scene, then I stay withdrawn until either A) someone gains my trust back or B) I am frightened away or forced away from the group. <br /> <br />Scenario B tends to happen more often than scenario A, because people assume that when I am withdrawn it is because of a personal grudge of some sort (i.e. an extension of whatever incident set them off to begin with). So rather than get attached to people or depend on people (to do things they don\'t realize I expect them to do) and consequently have my hopes crushed over and over, it seems better for everyone if I simply keep as many things as possible under my own control, and unfortunately that means not letting too many other people factor into my life. <br /> <br />As a side note to that, if I don\'t let anyone get too close, it has the added effect of not allowing me to get emotionally attached to anyone (I can easily become emotionally attached if I am not careful because of my need for acceptance). That means that by keeping my barriers firm, I make it easier to detach from people when the time comes. <br /> <br />I have a few people who know that I am autistic, and whom I feel comfortable enough to welcome myself around. These certain people are my social and emotional lifeline when my contact with the rest of the world breaks down. They are aware of my quirks, know how to read my shut down process, and quickly show forgiveness and support if and when there is a meltdown or social blunder. And it is usually through them in one way or another that I periodically find new avenues into the rest of the NT world. <br /> <br />As a result of having to deal with unexpected consequences on a fairly regular basis, I now make a concerted effort to be prepared for failure and loss at all times. To help accomplish this, I have put a number of pre-meditated measures in place to cushion myself emotionally when it happens. The only times I really go off the deep end is when I have several falls in quick succession, in which case I exhaust my emotional reserves before I am able to extinguish all of the problems that incur themselves. In these cases if it were not for my core of \"close\" friends, not to mention my Christian faith, I would be a very real danger to myself. There have been a few times when I have doubted that even those two safety nets would be enough to save me. <br /> <br />With all that having been said, there are some social skills that many autistic people simply cannot learn. It\'s just not wired into us. I can\'t tell you how many times I have been able to logically dissect the way I should approach a particular interaction with another person, what I should say, how I should say it, and how I should hold my posture, and be totally ready mentally, only to panic and shut down when the conversation takes a turn that I hadn\'t foreseen or my words were misconstrued. It\'s extremely discouraging to know exactly what you need to do and still not be able to do it. <br /> <br />SO WHAT CAN BE DONE? <br /> <br />Simply put, be clear about expectations. Be sure that the rules are not only clearly understood, but clarify why they are in place as well. Try to take the guesswork out of correcting things that look bad in the public\'s eye, or irritate other people. Even things that cannot be improved on can sometimes be curbed to a degree in public. The thing is, it\'s terrifying to be in a situation in which you know you are not acting right, but you don\'t know the correct way to act. Anything that can be done to alleviate this uncertainty will be welcome to someone who cannot garner the information from mere intuition. <br /> <br />Aside from that, each individual person who exhibits social delays will have to find the method that works best for him, whether that means never socializing at all or socializing to some personal limit. Just remember that social rules that are common sense to the NT are often completely invisible to the individual with autism, so if you really want to help, you would do well to fill in as many pieces to the puzzle as you can. Try to find real-life examples that can be watched and observed. Believe it or not, I learned a lot by watching movies and TV shows, then asking questions about why a character acted in a certain way. If I got an answer that made sense to me, I would look for a real life example to observe, compare it with the input I got from the TV example, and enter it into my mental database to be tried out, used, and perfected. <br /> <br />In any event, social rules will be learned at a gradual pace, and patience will be of the utmost importance. It will vary greatly from person to person which rules can be learned, how long it will take to learn them, and to what degree they can be learned. As long as the caring party does not show too much outward frustration, the autistic individual is likely to remain inclined to try. <br /> <br /> <br />A LITTLE ON DEPRESSION &#150; HOLD THE VALIUM, PLEASE <br /> <br />I have battled depression on and off since I was about 10. It comes and goes, but it can be very severe at times. I\'ve found that the more I feel \"accepted\" the less severe my depression bouts are, but they can and do occur to some extent even when I am in a good environment. During severe bouts I can be extremely withdrawn and difficult to reach. I feel a very intense lack of self worth, and have trouble comprehending that anyone is willing to have me around. Consequently, I have been known to feel like no one would miss me if I were no longer present - a concept that frightens me on regular basis. <br /> <br />Medications have never helped me with this. It\'s almost entirely environmental. <br /> <br />SO WHAT CAN BE DONE? <br /> <br />First of all, I am no expert on this subject, nor do I pretend to be. However, I can tell you this much: depression, if it is going to show up, usually begins to do so in the preteen to adolescent years, when identity and self worth begin to become major players. It can be serious and even become life threatening in some cases (I have pre-meditated and come up with a plan for my own death on at least a dozen occasions since the age of 20). Therefore, I would have to say that it is highly adviseable that professional help is reached if you suspect depression. <br /> <br />Aside from that, I think that constant praise and support does wonders. Remember that autistic people want to be accepted and tend to fear rejection, so reassurance is key to erasing some of the feelings of inferiority that come with not being able to keep up. I tend to repeatedly forget that I am accepted, even around friends, and I need to be constantly reminded or else I will unconsciously convince myself I am no longer wanted and become withdrawn, especially when I have made a mistake. So I think that as someone who is seeing this develop from the outside, it\'s important that you remember to remind your child, friend, or relative on a regular basis that you accept him and that he has your support. And also let him know every time he does a job well and try not to focus too much on his mistakes. Of course mistakes should be corrected, but it is better to focus on what can be done next time, rather than what should have been done the last time. If you use the latter too often, any analytical person (a common trait among autism) with a fair degree of intelligence will become stricken with remorse and will slack off in performance out of fear of messing up again. I have always found that I function a lot better when people are focusing on what I\'m doing right, or what I have the possibility to do, rather than what I\'m doing wrong. If a lot of emphasis gets put on my mistakes, even in a joking manner, I tend to shut down and things go from bad to worse because I feel like I can\'t redeem myself. That feeds the monster known as depression, and once it begins it is a self-feeding cycle. <br /> <br /><div class=\'post_sig\'>-   ~Nick   Still in touch with my inner child ;)</div>'

'DH and I are disagreeing about something.<br> <br> Neel goes to an integrated preschool. He started about 2 months ago. In his classroom there are 10 kids- 6 typical and 4 special needs. There are 2 teachers- one for the typical kids and one spec ed teacher for the 4 special needs kids. There are often therapist in the room working with the kids too- ST, OT, PT, so usually there are 3 adults for the 10 kids.. He goes 3 days/week.<br> <br> So for the past 3 weeks Neel has been in \"stimming mode\".<img src=\"smileys/smiley6.gif\" border=\"0\">.

'<P>I have to agree that the teachers, by and large, have great expertise and usually a genuine desire to help their students and individual children. However, teachers in IEP meetings are not always free to express their honest opinions and they are not in charge of spending the District\'s money. The administrators are. Many a teacher is told to keep her mouth shut. Teachers who don\'t have tenure have their jobs in the balance. Teachers who DO have tenure can be retaliated against in other, unpleasant ways (ask me how I know). My strategy is to learn as much from the teacher ahead of time that I can. As a parent, I have GREAT respect for most teachers who work with my child. I also believe that most teachers who don\'t HAVE expertise in autism welcome consultation and other forms of information. However, teachers have far less power in an IEP meeting than parents do. Parents have legal procedural safeguards that they can access. Teachers don\'t. I don\'t think this thread is about teacher bashing at all. Frankly, the teachers in an IEP meeting are just Exhibit A in the evidence gathering part of the IEP meeting. The teacher is encouraged to give factual input and even her opinion. The Chairperson of the Committee can treat that info any way she wants. The two parties who have actual power in an IEP meeting are the Chairperson, who is authorized to commit District funds, and the parents, who can dispute the decision of the IEP meeting legally. The written testing and reports and any other information that the other members of the IEP Committee present are the evidence. If those members (and this will include you) have the trust and respect of the Chairperson, that evidence can be very powerful in convincing her that the decision should go one way or another. But the bottom line lies with the parents. We parents have to negotiate with the District and the Chairperson, psychologist, teachers and therapists all represent the District. The only person in the IEP meeting who represents ONLY the child is the parent (even if the parent brings an advocate or lawyer, the PARENT is the final arbiter since those folks are not considered in consensus - they are the PARENT\'s evidence, if you will). Also, many, many times, the teachers who come to the IEP table are REGULAR ed teachers. I know that a special ed teacher has to a part of the committee, but often that teacher doesn\'t really know that child and doesn\'t have to bear responsibility for that child\'s IEP (or test scores at the end of the year). The person who does is a regular ed teacher who doesn\'t have a lot of experience with autism since mainstreaming autistic kids is fairly new. The political truth is that teacher have very little official power in an IEP meeting. That is not to say that SOME teachers don\'t have LOTS of power. That depends on the individual dynamics between the teacher and the other members of the Committee. But isn\'t that always true in any human interaction? Some people are more effective than others. We, as parents, have to figure out ways to be as effective as <U>we</U> can be. The truth is that if the IEP Committee thinks that a particular parent is a dummy but gives the child an excellent IEP anyway, that parent has been successful. As a tactic, some parents day the \"dummy approach.\" It\'s not unlike playing Columbo. Using ignorance to lead the Committee down the primrose path to giving your child what he needs. However, that\'s a pretty sophisticated tactic and I wouldn\'t recommend it for most. </P> <P>I think virtually all the people on this board would sing the praises of the teachers here. But I\'ve seen too many teachers and adminstrators dis what the parents know. This is not only not fair but it cuts off a VERY important resource for the District to use. In this situation, the old ad phrase applies - \"A mind is a terrible thing to waste.\" We parents have minds, and a smart IEP Committee MINES our minds. We ought to mine theirs, too. You are clearly a very committed, knowledgable and dedicated teacher. I\'ve certainly learned lots from your posts over time. But not every teacher is like you and not every teacher is even required to learn what you have learned or is even given the opportunity. </P>'

'<P>Yeah, I agree. Cut her out of the loop. She doesn\'t even need to be part of the loop unless those that test need some professional input from her. Other than that, she\'s not important on the testing bit. I would go straight to the admins. Just keep all requests, in writing, to them. And, I wouldn\'t go back and forth with her. Your phone is your phone, your son is your son, you do what\'s best for him. I would maybe say, if you want to address it, \"thank you for your input on our situation\" and drop it.

'<P>I posted this elsewhere and haven\'t gotten any response, so I thought I might post it again. I have a situation with a child at school who does not have a dx of anything and is not sp ed. I only see this child because I do intervention with him. Without giving away too much info, I will try to explain the help I am looking for. </P> <P>This is his 2nd year in K, he will be 7 next month, he has the same K teacher this year as he did last year. About the last 2 months of school last year, his behavior got really bad. School didn\'t start well this year. He spent the first hour of the day in my room on Friday trying to calm down from being upset for having to come in the school building. I was the third person to get to him that morning, he threw his backpack at the principal, was up running around waiting on the bell to ring, and another teacher told him to sit down and he said \"NO\". When I found him, he was just sitting and screaming. He told me he didn\'t like school, it scares him, there are too many people at school. Things escalated although I was ignoring him, he didn\'t like this. I told him I was going to call his mother and he said \"you don\'t know my momma\'s phone number, hahahaha, and kept saying it until he was finally screaming it. </P> <P>He was able to get his worksheet done that i went and got from his K teacher, but to begin with he told me he didn\' t like worksheets and threw it on the floor. After about 15 mins of him just yelling, i calmly told him that it was his choice to get the worksheet done and go to class or sit where he was. He finally did it, and was able to return to class. We talked about the morning events and I used a social story. His K teahcer reported to me that he was good in the classroom the rest of the day. However, there was a major safetly issue at PE.</P> <P>I talked to his mother after school and she said she will come in and talk with us. The problem is, she told us last year that she had never taken him out of the house, he had no pre-k. We chalked it up to maturity and had him repeat, but things are not better. I don\'t want to refer him to be tested for sp ed b/c I don\'t think he has Autism and I don\'t want to label him ED at the age of 6. </P> <P>I am working on a classroom behavior management plan for the regular ed teacher to be able to follow. And of course I will stay involved as intervention.</P> <P>I guess I would like advice as to what you guys think this might be. And, what are some BIP things that you have seen work for your children. Since he is not in sp ed, there are no \"related services\" that he can be offered. The reason I don\'t think he has Autism is because he is very very verbal, and I don\'t think his IQ would be exceptionally high, so no Asperger\'s. </P> <P>I guess I am just at a loss for deciding to test or not. I don\'t want to lable him ED at the age of 6. The other sp ed teacher that actually would \"serve\" him if he placed in sp ed doesn\'t want him tested because she doesn\'t want to deal with him. So she is of no help. I am just at a loss. </P> <P>Sorry this is so long, but it\'s just on my mind, as I want to help this little boy so much.</P>'

So they dont think the Autism supports are nec-kwim? That is his official diagnosis from a Childrens Hospital-by a psychiatrist. He stressed that the anxiety and ODD fell UNDER the PDD-NOS-which is what the school isnt recognising etc. </P> <P> As far as the IQ-thanks for clarifying things abt that. Since he scored so low they -the psychologist at school says there isnt a gap to show his potential, and his PDD-NOs-so he is doing as best is expected etc. Hence he did have a bit of a problem classifying him educationally eligible, yet I showed him the dsm and asked him witch ones did Bailey not posess and he conceded to agree with me-as Bailey showed many behaviors on there etc. Baileys teacher came to me after the meeting and said that she just didnt agree with the IQ findings at all-which was nice to hear. ......So he was finally found eligible-mind you this whole process took well over 60 days-all year we all struggled with this and it finally got resolved 3 months before school got out!!! I didnt know the time requirement at the time-so yes they walked all over me on that:(</P> <P> Thank you for letting me know not to let them take away this label that I have fought so hard for-this is what I have been struggling with.

'J failed math last quarter and is on his way to failing it this quarter and not getting credit for the course. I hired a tutor twice a week, made him stay after school for help and curtailed his video gaming. Nothing is helping. J has a well above average performance IQ and usually excels in math. This year, it\'s been different. Today, he told his tutor that he has not been sent to the testing center for his math tests and that no one has read the tests to him all year. Apparently, no classified kids from the math class are getting their test accommodations. I\'ve had multiple meetings with teachers about these stinky math grades and no one said EVER told me that he was being made to take the tests with the rest of the class and that the tests were not being read to him. I am livid. I have emailed the math teacher, spec. ed, teacher, psychologist, principal and guidance counselor, instructing them that he needs his test mods! J is easily distracted and makes sloppy, inattentive errors when he doesn\'t focus. Does anyone have anyone advice as to what else I should do? Can he still fail math in light of this? What to do?

'I am back from the IEP/placement meeting. The district had wanted to <br />move my ds to a self-contained program which in principel I have nothing <br />against but in this case and at this time I did not feel it was the most <br />appropriate action for my ds. I was told that this district does hardly ever <br />okay part-time aides and does not usually provide asd specific training <br />for teachers in mainstream. <br />I prepared for this meeting more than I ever did for any college final and I <br />gave them a long speech about why I was not agreeing with the district <br />and what I felt my son needed and why. I could quote district policy by <br />heart, kew the histroy of every program proposed and threw in quotes <br />from asd studies and the WHO for good measure. They just looked at <br />each other and I got every single thing I requested and more. My ds can <br />stay in his current placement, he will get a full-time aide and the whole <br />school will get an inservice on asd, his aide and teachers will get training <br />and the new IEP looks pretty good and comprehensive. Best of all, it did <br />not feel like I won the battle and lost the war - all was very respectful and <br />I\'ll be happy to work with the same team again next year. <br />I am dealing with a financially strapped but reasonable district (which <br />never hurts) but I just wanted to put out there: If you do your homework <br />and can make a good case of why your kid needs what he needs districts <br />might find a way to give it to you.

'Can you go visit? Unlike visiting some public schools, charter school (although they are fully public) often run more like private schools and THEY decide who can come visit and who can\'t - without getting your current school district\'s permission. There is a charter school near me that is very much like the one you describe. Whether or not a child on the spectrum does well depends A LOT on whether that child fits in with the particular school\'s focus. There are two charter schools near me. One is not doing too well. One apparently is. The one that is not doing too well has historically accepted kids who don\'t have IEPs but should. However, their parents don\'t want their kids \"lableled\" or the school disticts have not approved classifcation for some reason. From what I understand, most of the kids in this school have reading issues but are not on the spectrum. The other school acknowledges that they accept ASD kids. However, these are ASD kids who are close to grade level in academics and mostly need small classes and people who understand the issues of kids on the spectrum. This charter school is newer. I\'ve heard (tho don\'t know) that the children who are closer to the Asperger end of the spectrum do well there but those ASD kids who struggle, academically, do not. All of this is just rumor. I have never gone to visit either school. Seeing tells a lot. Go visit. Each charter school is different.'
'Could you explain this post a little more, I don\'t really understand what is meant by it!!

'<br><br>After we adopted 3 children on the spectrum who were in Public school, we also saw the working of 4 districts in 2 states and the level of our involvement in fighting for the children\'s public education was exhausting. I realized I was wasting so much time at the schools fighting for the whole special education of my children that I was losing what I believe my main focus should be (to educate my children). It\'s one thing to fight for it but if your child isn\'t being educated in the mean time, what has the child gained? Nothing, but it was time lost. We only have 1 shot at our children\'s education. What the schools had to offer only drove us further away from them.<br><br>Our 6yo dd was kicked out (behavior) of 4 schools and had not met one goal on her IEP in 2 years- she does not do well in large typical classroom environments.<br>Our 5yo dd was non verbal and had never met a goal.<br>Our 4yo son is non verbal and he had never met a goal through his Early education programs nor the public school preschool programs.<br><br> In our home school, we now \"live\" a therapy sort of lifestyle. I am with my children helping guide them daily, hourly, sometimes by the minute. We have converted our living room to a fully functional and stocked classroom . There is not any negativity, bad behaviors, etc. allowed. My children are not picking up on bullying, teasing, etc. from other children. They are interactive in a positive way with the community when daily we get together with other families for home school co-op, music, PE, serving neighbors and volunteering.<br><br><br><br> Our children got an average of 12 HOURS a week of therapy (cha ching for the school district). They were teased. My very verbal 6yo never spoke a word in school for 3 years. Nobody expected her to and happily she met their expectations because that was most comfortable to her. (Now, at home and in pulic she memorizes songs and books and can\'t close her mouth) The teachers admitted to me they saw them as a \"lost cause\" <img src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"> (The one good teacher we met out of everyone quit over that fact). In public school, my 6yo was allowed to \"Hmph\" and cross her arms and stand in the corner, she loves this and \"deals\" with hard things this way. My 5yo and 4yo\'s were allowed to just stare out the windows and hand flap. The school wanted to \"let them be\".. Nobody expected greater things from them. I realized my children didn\'t have to be failed in their education any longer, that I could put it in my hands and actually start educating them.<br><br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Take time to be Holy, Speak often with thy Lord!

'I called the web site to get some additional info. I talked to Sharon Ruben who wrote the book and also guides the class. She is out of Virginia.

You can buy just the CD\'s/headphones by itself, or up it to have bone conduction amplifiers ect. She explains it all as well as what they do ect.

'PECS is an EXCELLENT way to get functional language. If your child is not using the words he knows as a tool, then he is not yet verbal. \"Verbal\" means using language to have wants and needs met as well as to socialize. The first two are the minimum for being considered verbal. Echolalia is preverbal since the words are not used for a communicative purpose, or at least not appropriately. PECS can REALLY help with this. When I described my son, his language was very useful and appropriate at the time, just not standard (and still isn\'t). PECS best helps in getting a child to truly understand what language is FOR. I\'d head for the PECS icons asap.'

'<P>They are right insofar as they believe that a disability has to impede the student\'s \"Education\" in order for the student to qualify for an IEP. However, \"Education\" includes far more than academics. 1. It definitely does include academics, but if a child has no academic issues, but the child has other issues that impeded his access ot an education, those issues must be included 2. FUNCTIONAL skills. This most definitely includes social skills, pre-employment skills, practical skills, organizational skills, self-regulation skills, etc. 3. It includes management - IE, Behavior. Either increasing desirable behavior or decreasing undesirable behavior.</P> <P>Your school district CANNOT take away an IEP unless you SIGN for declassifying your child. They CAN take you to a hearing over it. But then your child gets \"pendency\" or \"stay put.\" You don\'t have to sign for a re-evaluation at this point unless it\'s been at least 3 years since the last evaluation. Of course, the District CAN take you to a hearing over that, too. BUt hearings COST MONEY. I would not take them to a hearing, though. If they take YOU it\'s incumbent on them to PROVE their point.

'I think I can safely say that I am in agreeance with everyone here. <br /> <br />I can also safely say that you\'re going to have thicken your skin to what quasi-proffesionals tell you in regards to your child. <br /> <br />First, educate yourself. Second, trust in yourself and YOUR knowledge of YOUR child. This is the thing those quasi-proffessional will ALWAYS fail to acknowledge: you know you child better than they do. <br /> <br />This will not be the first time you hear: \"well, we just don\'t see what you do.\" <br /> <br />Video taping is an AWESOME way to go. We never had to do that with our daughter (profound ASD), but we are audio recording our undiagnosed 9yo son\'s anger outbreaks. Every eval (three) came back the same, \"yes, he\'s academically and logically a teenager but his social aptitudes are severely lacking but we\'re just not seeing anything consistant enough to give a diagnosis.\" <br /> <br />Despite three eval checklist which clearly point to asperger\'s. When we go for his next eval we\'re goign to have audio evidence, lol. <br /> <br />So, stay the course, trust in yourself and be prepared to bull-doze when civility and reason yield no results. <br /> <br />And don\'t let it get you down. <br /> <br />For all the hardships, there are those moments when our daughter will curl up on your lap and rest her head on your shoulder... and even though she\'s off and running in less than a minute...

'<P>Hi Angelina,</P> <P>You have a right to refuse to immunize your child if you choose. That should be an extremely well researched and thought out choice in my opinion. You will need to sign something for the school district saying that you choose not to immunize. There is no reliable research at this time that proves a link between immunizations and autism.</P> <P>If your daughter is just entering the public school system, does she have an IEP? If not, contact the school district\'s department of special education and tell them of her needs. They will very likely want to do an educational assessment before she comes to school. This assessment is completely free to you, and will identify your daughter\'s educational needs.</P>'

In fact, schools are even responsible for paying for your child to have a physical or an eye exam or an audiological exam or even pay for glasses or hearing aids if your child has been shown to NEED these things in order to access FAPE. That means that they can\'t charge for ANYTHING that contributes to your child\'s education. Not even those long lists of \"supplies\" they send home every August. Of course, most of us are happy to provide our children with the supplies all other kids are asked to get - it\'s part of the school experience. But being blackmailed into giving a \"donation\" is something entirely different.

'<P>Again, as previously stated, the school psychologist is looking at your child\'s functioning <strong>within the school environment, </strong>and in that environment, he may be considered severely affected.</P> <P>The <strong>Educational classification</strong> of Autism under IDEA does not negate a medical diagnosis that may place the child on the spectrum with a <strong>Medical diagnosis</strong>. Those are basically two different things. A child who is medically diagnosed on the spectrum as mild to moderately affected may not even have an educational classification of autism. They may have services provided for speech/language issues, or for a specific learning disability in math, reading, etc., but may not have enough behavioral characteristics to qualify as educationally autistic. </P> <P>The educational classification and the medical diagnosis are two different perspectives for two different environments. It is necessary to understand the components of both thoroughly and to have an effective understanding of the evaluations used in each environment in order to be able to effectively advocate for your child and explain how your child\'s medical diagnosis affects his ability to access education. Each environment - medical and educational - has its own criteria that has to be met, even if the terms appear interchangeable.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- COPAA Advocate Member,MPact Mentor, single parent to 4 ages 19 to 6, all with disabilities.

'Excellent, I am glad to hear about this development. On a side note: <br />when we have an IEP date and an eval date that don\'t \"line up\" we either <br />move the eval up so it happens early enough that results can be used for <br />the IEP (not useful in your circumstance) OR we basically make a new IEP <br />called an \"interim\" IEP, that looks very much like the old one, and has end <br />dates after the eval is complete so that a new IEP is written when the eval <br />results are in. <br />And once permission has been signed for testing, the assessment must <br />be completed within 30 school (student contact) days.'

'I need some wisdom.<br><br>My son\'s Special Education teacher just called me. My son is in the 5th grade. His homeroom is the Special Education classroom. He hardly spends very much time there as he is advanced enough to go to an actual resource room for reading and math and such. He goes to P.E./Health with the regular classroom and has a desperately hard time with the health piece. He goes to music with the regular class as well.<br><br>So my son\'s Special Ed teacher wants my son to be moved from her classroom next year. She doesn\'t feel he needs it anymore. She wants him to go to the regular classroom with an aide for now and to resource. I got the impression that they want to start with an aide and faze this out as well as time goes on. He will be asked to do Science and Social Studies in the regular classroom now. He won\'t be successful.<br><br>Some background. My son hasn\'t been diagnosed with asd yet. We plan to do this during the summer months. He has always had full services since he was 2 years old. We have been doing research and have known for several years that he is asd. The school doesn\'t have a diagnosis for him other than mental delay. We started out in the regular classroom in K, 1st, and 2nd with him going to the Special Ed room for one on one help. In 2nd grade we moved him to Special Ed as his main class room. He couldn\'t keep up with the other kids. He loves his classroom. He is very successful. <br><br>My worries are that we are now setting him up to fail. A regular classroom teacher will now be his regular teacher and won\'t know much about asd. He won\'t have a support network and his social skills are terrible. <br><br>His Special Ed teacher said she wanted to start this next year and just amend his IEP which we just finished in February. I said I wanted a meeting. She said they don\'t normally have a meeting for an amendment but she would call a meeting for me.<br><br>What do I do?<br>What do I ask?<br>What do I have a right to demand?<br>What is the school required to offer my son?<br><br>I am heart broken for him.

You guys have got to get the \"all\" and \"always\" and the \"everything\" and the \"everyone\" out of your heads. There are no such things as absolutes here, and anyone who tells you that there are is full of crap. Just throw the idea of blanket clauses out the window. <br /> <br />That\'s why you have to know your circumstances and know the people you are trying to help. They know there are inevitable surprises too. And their goals will tend to gravitate toward buffering themselves for them by familiarizing themselves with the things that they <em>can</em> count on. By doing that they can be aware of their options when the plans change. So that means your margin of error simply depends on the degree of uncertainty. <br /> <br />Simply put, anticipate what you <em>can</em>, and tend to what you <em>do</em> know about, and your margin of forgiveness for the things you <em>can\'t</em> anticipate will be greater than if you just say \"well I can\'t be prepared for <em>everything</em>\" and leave it at that.

'<P>Around these parts, we do have the open enrollment period, but that only applies to other schools in the district. For example, School XYZ 20 minutes from here is still a school within my district. The first week of school, students who are zoned for School XYZ can come to my school and enroll and be accepted no questions asked because it is still within the same district. BUT School ABC that is 10 minutes up the road is not in my district. It is in another district. The child zoned for School XYZ and can not go enroll in School ABC because they are seperate districts. School ABC does accept out of district kids but only if there is room and there is a fee. However, checking in to another school in your same district that may be safer is a good idea.

'It depends on where you live and what the school district policies are in the area where we live the child must have a deficency in two areas such as speech and motor in order to qualify and the deficency must be at least 50 %. Also in the school district we are in the have two seperate programs so one is a two day a week preschool for 2 hours the other if they have an autism diagnosis is 5 days a week for 2 1/2 hours. With my oldest we were in a different school district and they kind of did the same thing the deficency had to be at least 50% in two to three areas to qualify or an autism diagnosis. That school district was a mixed class that went 4 days a week for 2 1/2 hours. In this state autism is not considered a diagnosis until the children are ten, so they classify it all under developmental delays. It then becomes the school districts responsibility to place them appropriately. I guess my question is do you want him to go to preschool if he doesn\'t qualify for public school and if you do what kind of preschool are looking for. I know in this area they have Co-op preschools which are great because it requires parent participation and you earn school credit doing it. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Courage is being scared to death - and saddling up anyway! -John Wayne    Mom to two beautiful boys with ASD ages six and nine</div>'

I believe that it is now time to be more pro-active, to attain home-based services, and estabish an on-going relationship with a psychologist or other medical professional.

The school district is required to show how your individual child is meeting the state\'s standards for ALL children. All kids with IEPs are ALSO covered by No Child Left Behind requirements. I\'d suggest getting a good advocate and also getting a copy of FROM EMOTIONS TO ADVOCACY and paying attention particularly to chapters 10 and 11, which cover tests and measurements.'

'Tzoya, <br />I did not give them permission to his medical records. What they have is the diagnosis of autism from the psychologist, but that report includes basically the history of his previous evaluations-I thought it would look weird for me to only give half the report and I thought giving the report where he was diagnosed with autism would be the place to start. I also decided to give his most recent speech evaluation where the expressive language delay is documented. Other than these documents, they have nothing else. But, as I said, the evaluation report from the center that evaluated him sums up his evaluation history. I really didn\'t think that just because neuropsychs did not think he was autistic at age 2 that that would be significant given his diagnosis at age 4. The ADOS will be interesting. Usually my son will not score autistic on any standardized test; however, during the past six months I notice more flapping and verbal stims, so I think he might score lower now. Anyway, the entire siutation is totally bizarre as Tammy suggests! It\'s as though I\'m being asked do I want him to be autistic? And I\'m trying to ask, well, IS he autistic? - and I thought I had answered that in my head, that yes, he is on the spectrum! To me, looking at his past scores on tests, the fact that he is so borderline to me suggests autism-I mean, given that he\'s always borderline, he requires a clinical judgment and that came from the psychologist who sees autism every day and the social worker who observed him in various settings. The neuropsychs who also saw that he was borderline on the ADOS at age 2-instead of questioning that, they assumed that I was \"too soft\" as a parent. I mean, that struck me as totally bizarre: one minute he\'s borderline for autism, a brain disorder, and next minute you\'re saying well, ignore the social skills deficits and borderline symptoms of autism, we think you should just discipline him more. I think I better go read the fine print and make sure I get the results of the evaluation before the IEP meeting! Thanks for your support. <br />Nowwhat'

'Not all test publishers give age or grade equivalents, I\'ve been told. The really important thing is to get the testers to explain the scores to you and ask for the scores to all be expressed in the same way. For me, percentiles work best. That system of scoring is easily understandable to me. In <U>From Emotions to Advocacy, </U>Pete Wright suggests that you ask the evaluators to translate the scores into standard scores, percentiles, age equivalents, grade equivalents and also give you the raw scores. The point is that you want to compare apples to apples. Sometimes kids are given tests that are NOT normed for their age group. ASK if a particular test is normed for your son\'s age group. If it\'s not, it can\'t be considered a valid test for him, even if it a valuable test for him. If that test is valuable, let them give it but ask them to give another test for that area of development that IS normed for his age group. At a Trienniel Review, ask for an IQ test (one that\'s appropriate for your child\'s language development or lack thereof), an Adaptive test (like the Vineland), academic standardized testing in at least reading and math. You need to get an idea of reading decoding, comprehension, fluency, spelling. Of course, include a speech test, too. If you have concerns about your child\'s physical development, ask for an OT and PT eval. If behavior is an issue, ask for an FBA.'

They just wanted him to swing with them, play catch (which he amazingly did - he never would for me!), etc. But, boys are less complex in their play than girls typically - so maybe it wouldn\'t be as good for Sarah. I do understand your point - and you have to do what is best for Sarah. </P> <P>Personally, I was thrilled that ds came home with friends who were from Somalia, Sudan, Mexico and other countries as well! I am hoping he learned how it is to be in the minority (I use this example with him all the time to drive home the point while it is still fresh in his brain) and that he will hopefully learn about prejudice and how awful it can be - before he gets exposed to it personally and understands what is going on (which I am sure he someday will). </P> <P>But again, Sarah is a girl and she is older than my ds and in a higher grade.

'<P>I will say we have done both private and school ST with both of my children. I honestly haven\'t been able to tell the difference. Neither of my children are in private ST now, but they still receive services in the public school. My daughter receives therapy with 2 other children, but she is older and is almost to the point that she no longer needs therapy. </P> <P>I know my son is receiving individual therapy at least once a week. We have had good results with his therapy. </P>'
'<P>My daughter is 10 yr old. She was born perfect, apgar 9, with her eyes wide open and holding her head up in the delivery room. She is incredably beautiful &amp; intelligent. As a toddler, she never potty trained well for BMs. She always had (encoprersis)accidents 1-3x week but sometimes went on the toilet. We were advised by her Dr. and books on potty training that at ages 4, 5 ,&amp; 6 accidents are normal - don\'t worry. When she turned 7 (1st time parents) we realized that this was NOT normal. We took her to the Dr. who told us absurd things like she was drinking too much water and not eating enough fruits and veggies. We minitored her diet closely but it didn\'t help. We thought it was psychological because she had always been an extremely reistant child. We made a \"accident chart\". If she didn\'t have one she would be greatly rewarded. If she had one she would be punished. I realize now this was the worst thing we could have done. It made her stop having accidents, but we didn\'t know that she probably had completely stopped going for about 3 weeks straight, causing megacolon. We still didn\'t understand what had happened and the encopreisis continued with a vengence.</P> <P>At age 8 the school informed us that they thought she had ADD. We started seeing a nuerologist who agreed. I thought GREAT, now we knew why she doesn\'t go on the toilet - she has ADD! However, the nuerologist insisted that ADD does not cause accidents and referred me to gastroenterologist </P> <P>She than saw a gastroenterologist who put her on enough laxatives and stool softners to put down an elephant for about 8 months. It was compeltely debilitating.. everytime she stood up, it would just pour out of her. The Dr. had immotility testing done (extremely invasive) on her colon and said her colon did not contract until 15 mg. of laxitives were given (3x the amount for an adult) and that she physically could not have a BM without it.</P> <P>I knew he was wrong!! So many things were a contridiction on the test results. For example, she would often go in her sleep. She never smells it after she goes, and would sit in it all day unless someone told her to go clean up. This doctor told us she was lying that she knew when she went and knew when she had to go. He also said I was a non-compliant parent; when i had bent over backwards to follow his treatment plan. I knew my daughter was not lying. She would pray to God at night to please make her be able to go on the toilet. This doctor finally told me that since her colon didn\'t work properly, it should be removed. A cecostomy! This was not acceptable to me. We don\'t even know what\'s wrong with her! He said that there were three children scheduled to have thier colons removed that week. Why would anyone do that??? We stopped going to that doctor. We stopped the laxative treatment. We started a high insoluable fiber diet. Sometimes she can go a month without laxatives. Sometimes she needs them every three days. I knew that Dr. was wrong but he just wouldn\'t listen to me.</P> <P>She has also seen a psychiatrist, behavioral psychologist, had physical therapy of pelvic floor muscles, and of course still sees her nueroligist. She has not had a BM on the toilet for over two years. When she has an accident we have a good system and it is working well. We keep a bucket of bleach and water in the bathroom. She puts the soiled underware in the bucket (for me to clean later - she has refused to wear pull ups since she was two) she cleans herself with baby wipes or takes a shower if need. She is able to do this unassisted. She never has had an accident at school. </P> <P>I have had another child, a boy, who is now 6. I knew when he was two that there was something wrong. Intially, has was also diagnosed with ADHD, but then that was changed Autism NOS. </P> <P>My neurolgist says he doesn\'t know if my daughter has highly functioning autism or not. He says she has ADD symptoms and she is treated with medication for these. That doesn\'t mean she has ADD, only means the medicine works well for her. He still does not acknowledge that encopresis is a symptom of Autism, but i am working on him and keep insisting. It is uncommon for girls to have this. Girls have differrent symptoms than boys. It has been 6 years since we started and we are still looking for a diagnosis (other than chronic constipation and ADD). </P> <P>I was really excited when I read about the 11 yr old boy in Australia. i feel like this confirms how i feel. The only difference is that he has a diagnosis of autism and my child does not. Anyone who has any advise for me, i would love to hear it. </P> <P>One more thing - pull up\'s are really bad for the enviroment. even if you use underware and throw it out, it is more biodegradable than a pull up. underware and pull ups cost the same amount of money. When you take laxatives, unfortunately it becomes really runny and you might occasionally need a pull up. With a healthy diet, BMs should not be all that messy. Pull ups are also hard to find and cost more in larger sizes. if I knew then what i know now about cleaning underware I would have used cloth diapers on both kids. live and learn. </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- tie dye lady</div>'

'I am so angry for you!

'<P>An IEP is only successful if it helps the child MAKE PROGRESS, academically, functionally and behaviorally. Progress needs to be tested each year. ALso, your District needs to keep intervening until your child meets grade level standards. NCLB (which applies to our kids, too) says that ALL children need to be reading on the third grade level by third grade. If your child isn\'t, your District needs to be using a research-based, peer-reviewed reading program with him AND showing that he is making progress in this program. If not, they have to try something else. Placement decisions are based on whether or not the current placement can give your child all the proper interventions for the above to take place. If not, that environment is not restrictive enough for your child and a more restrictive placement is <EM>HIS</EM> LRE. </P> <P>The direct answer to your question is, you stop looking for the \"right\" placement when the placement starts meeting all your child\'s needs and he starts making testable progress. The gap only widens after 3rd grade. Your child might need a more specialized environment. My own son was in self-contained classes all his life and is now in a special school for special education HS kids who need vocational skills. He would have simply gotten lost in a mainstreaming situation. That\'s not true for all ASD kids, but it is for my son. Maybe yours, too.</P>'

While most likely little harm could be done, he could start becoming ketoacidotic ... </P> <P>Good luck ... </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Linda  mom to T, 9, ASD  S, 7, ADHD  A, 6 so far so good ...  we are an adoptive family</div>'
'<P>This \"Jekyl and Hyde\" phenomenon is pretty common - they hold it together in school and fall apart at home.</P> <P>What might work in the math situation is giving him a visual sign that he\'s done his work right (like drawing a star) instead of just words. He might also feel that right and wrong seem arbitrary when he always does his best to solve a problem, and yet sometimes the teacher says he\'s right and sometimes the teacher says he\'s wrong. Giving him a key or a calculator to check his work might give him more of a sense of control.</P> <P>Finally, on the subject of OCD vs. autism. I looked into this a few days ago and posted it under another subject, but I\'ll paste it here since it seems to be relevant.</P> <P>If you look at the traditional clinical definition of OCD, obsessions and compulsions must take up a significant amount of time (more than an hour a day) and significantly interfere with a person&#146;s daily life, occupation, academic pursuits, and/or relationships. Here\'s the clinical definition:</P> <P><A href=\"http://www.ocfchicago.org/overview.php?secti&#111;n=Diagnosis%20Definiti&#111;n\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.ocfchicago.org/overview.php?section=Diagnosis%20D efinition</A></P> <P>But recent research suggests that OCD and autism are very similar in terms of the brain (basal ganglia and frontal lobe) and how it reacts to SSRI medicines (for example, fluoxetine/Prozac, fluvoxamine/Luvox, paroxetine/Paxil, and sertraline/Zoloft). More details here: </P> <P><A href=\"http://psy3.ucsd.edu/~autism/WinterIMFAR2002.doc\" target=\"_blank\">http://psy3.ucsd.edu/~autism/WinterIMFAR2002.doc</A></P> <P>Because of those neurological and pharmacological similarities, researchers are starting to lean towards seeing OCD as a spectrum disorder that includes neurological disorders that present with repetitive behaviors (like autism and Tourettes). More details here: </P> <P><FONT face=Arial size=2><A href=\"http://www.neuropsychiatryreviews.com/oct00/npr_oct00_ocd.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.neuropsychiatryreviews.com/oct00/npr_oct00_ocd.ht ml</A></FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>So it looks like what you\'re describing is at least a variant of OCD, regardless of whether it meets the traditional clinical definition or not.

'<P>DS got his progress report from his preschool today. He is on track with most of his goals except for communication. The number he got corresponded to - \"some progress; do not anticipate meeting goal by IEP end\". He does speak at home, albeit his language is limited and WAY below his age level. He asks for snacks and drinks and says maybe a dozen other phrases such as \"Turn light off\", \"Turn fan off\", \"Fix it\", \"Bumped head\", etc. I have a meeting scheduled for next week with the speech therapist who works in his classroom. I read his progress report on my way home from picking him up (when I stopped to pump gas) and literally started to cry on the way home.

'Hi,<br><br>I am also in NY. My son is currently in kindy. In Jan 2009, when he was in a specialized preschool for children on the spectrum, I asked one of the directors would he have to transition to kindy if I felt he wasn\'t ready (they felt he was more than ready to go in a regular kindy classroom). As you are aware, in NY (don\'t know if this is teh case everywhere) a child can wit on kindy until age 6. I felt ,my son wasn\'t mature enough. She said the determination is based on \"age eligible.\" That didn\'t answer my question, but I took it to mean that since he was first age eligible at 5, he\'d have to go to a kindy class. I also couldn\'t find anything in NY law about keeping a kindy eligible child in preschool another year and still get services.<br><br>So, I\'m really not much help, but thought I\'d share my experience. My suggestions would be to do some research on the NY law and maybe you\'ll find something. Talk with those in the know at your child\'s current preschool. Do you have a service coordinator? He/she may know the answer or could point you in the right direction. You could find an advocate who may know the answer. If you are comfortable with talking to the CPSE/CSE chairperson of your school district, you could ask him/her (something I didn\'t do then, but I will email him now about other concerns, and he is very thorough in his answers or asks around to get me an answer.)<br><br>In the end, it will be up to you to advocate for your child to pursue the services you feel are appropriate for your child. You will need to point out what is unique about your child\'s disability (not all children with autism are alike) and then point out, based on that, what is and isn\'t in the child\'s best interest. Be prepared for a little give and take. Maybe you won\'t get everything you want. If you have a list of things your want for your child, be ready to give up some to ensure getting others. <br><br>Depending on the school district, there may be alternate classroom settings where your child would be a kindergartener but not necessarily in a regular kindy classroom. You will have to do some homework to see what\'s out there.<br><br>My son attends a parochial school, by our choice, and gets services from the public school district. I had to advocate for location and times of services, because he was going to be bounced all over the school day-definitely not in his best interest when he, like many children on the spectrum, have trouble with constant transitions, plus he\'d lose crucial social time with his peers. <br><br>Feel free to PM me.

'<P>We were in a very similiar situation with DS, he was in the public pre school spec ed program for 2 years and as his birthday was in Aug, we had no choice but to place him in K as soon as he turned 5 or he would have lost his IEP and have to go thru the whole process again the following year. We ended up sending him and treating the 1st yr of K like a preschool. I picked him up early 3 days a week to continue with his private therapies (while he still rcvd his therapies thru the school). Even with his delay it was a nightmare at the end of that year... they wanted to push him into 1st (even without letter recongition and no writing skills) and I had to firmly demand he repeat K. He did much better his second yr in K, mastering concepts even though his writing abilities were very delayed. Our issue became it was just too much and we had to discontinue private therapies as he was too fatigued and just couldn\'t keep up with it all. He had excellent teachers, spending 1/2 his day in the reg classroom and half in the Spec Ed classroom. He rcvd his sensory diet as outlined in his IEP, wore his weighted vest/sleeves and his seat cushions. That was a fantastic year for him where he made much progress and was successful.</P> <P>We moved that summer and he had to go to a different school (within the same school district). There were major budget cuts and teh Spec Ed dept took a large hit. Unfortunatley the attitude at the new school was not so accomodating. I hadn\'t been in a situation where my opinion was so discounted and at every turn I was met with restistance. They became very quick to dismiss the sensory diet that had been so sucessful and wanted to make his IEP more and more vague. Even thru this he was doing ok academically. It was not until this year (grade 2) that everything started to unravel. Alot of the change came with DS himself, he was suddenly more aware of his differences and was taking it way to personally. He began saying things such as he wasn\'t good enough, he didn\'t deserve things, he was no good. Fortunately we were in a position to put him in a private school, and we found an excellent one here in the area taht caters to high functioning special needs. He is doing so well now... it was truly the best decision we have made for him thus far.</P> <P>On a social level... the kids were extremely forgiving up until this last year. They all seem much more self centered and less judgemental. DS has spacial issues, and wants to be touching someone always. His personal space issues are extreme... but the kids (thru several different classes/ages) were good with him. I didn\'t notice teasing or exclusion until the end of 1st and then this 2nd grade year...so I guess that is about 7-8yrs old.</P> <P>DS is a year older than his peers and I think that has worked great for him. Actually with his delay he gets along best with children that are younger. So from that standpoint, if your daughter is similiar, I don\'t think being older would be an issue.</P> <P>I don\'t know that this is really advise, but just letting you know what has been my experience. I also have a 13yr NT with a Aug bday who started K at 5. He struggled to keep up all thru elementary school.

'<P>Hi all,</P> <P>I just finished my courses of IEP\'s-Sean\'s first, then Colin\'s, and finally, Taylor\'s. It is Taylor\'s that is bothering me and I haven\'t figured out why I am so depressed since going to the meeting. She has made such REMARKABLE improvements in just 2 years-of the charts in many areas of expectation (by school staff, that is). I think it was attitude, but maybe it\'s just me.</P> <P>The team is great-the therapists, the teachers we have had since starting there, 5 years ago are wonderful. I have a great team of devoted and very understanding individuals. I tear up knowing that, after next year I go to where Sean is and all of this will be gone-the middle school isn\'t even close to comparing to what my kids have now.</P> <P>The head of the autism LD resource room is my problem. She started about 2 years ago, is the one that calls social services on such things as, my having new shoes for two and not for 3 kids, one day out of 5 years of Taylor having a bit of \"poop\" on her butt from changing herself before school without my knowledge (claimed neglect), calling my case manager over the dumbest things that could have been asked directly to me concerning taylor\'s issues with clothing (socks and coats, mainly)-She also has the \"better than you\" attitude-obviously well educated, and the \"overland park\" attitude of social status. You can notice the difference of the team meetings when she is in charge. The one for Colin is fun-we smile, joke a bit, and it is very lax-my meetings with this woman are very stern and everyone is quiet until it comes to their turn.</P> <P>Anyway, the distaste for my suggestions started when I brought up that, I am seeking a psych appointment to establish ADHD. After I said it, she stopped writing and gave me a look that made me feel, well..stupid for even considering it. She then said, \"well, OKAY THEN\" and sighed and went right on, without writing it down as one of my concerns \"which is what she was supposed to do at that point of an IEP\". I felt like a parent in denial, even though I am not and want my child to have everything that goes with her part of the spectrum, addressed-especially since focusing and hyperactivity are part of her issues and, if something can help her focus more, I am all for it.</P> <P>Her strengths were brought up, as if they were something I hadn\'t been telling this woman since she started-they were amazed she had such great computer skills (she can run a computer better than I, and it was my business for 20 years). She was given a word recognition test-they started her on KINDERGARTEN words first, which upset me. Of COURSE she knows those words-she has been running a DVR and Computer for years now, with typing in her own words and reading what is in the descriptions before choosing something-and these are written for adults! She, of course passed those words with flying colors (duh). They then went to age appropriate words-listing over 200 cards on table and then, saying the word and having Taylor find it in the cards on the table. She was 95% accurate (although, i am sure after 200 words, she had lost interest and could have been 100% accurate). This amazed the woman in charge and it was as if she hadn\'t heard a word that I had said, for the past 2 years of IEP, when I was asked to list strengths and observations at home. </P> <P>Taylor also uses assistive techology (springboard) to communicate and types in full sentences on that. Obviously, if she is typing in full sentences to communicate, she understands and can read the words..ugh.</P> <P>The team kept commenting on how far Taylor had come, considering that, even 2 years ago she screamed for 4 hours straight a day, and now only has outbursts for about 2 minutes, maybe once a week. They also brought up her many strengths in computer skills, over and over, as well as her recognition of schedules and procedure, as well as her willingness to help with things in the classroom, pertaining to education.</P> <P>What bothers me is that, every time someone brought this up and we started discussing it, the woman would stop us and move on. When I would say what Taylor has been doing at home, I would get a look as if to say, \"that is just breaking into our time and not pertinent to this meeting\", when I was trying to tell them that, I would like these issues worked on more in school, since they are obvious strengths and, maybe some day she can enhance her skills to be more inclusive in a regular ed classroom, with para help.</P> <P>The other thing that bothered me is that, they have her doing \"work duties\" more than academic strengths-she is shredding paper and crushing cans. Working as a Direct supports provider, I know what this means-and they confirmed it when I brought it up-she is being \"trained\", at 5th grade level, to work in a challenged-adult job. Two guys in my group home get paid to shred paper and crush cans. They also have her working with lining up cards in the cafeteria. I loved the idea at first, but when they added the other two things in with it, I knew, right away they were training her to be \"society contributing\", and not working on the strengths.</P> <P>I told them that, I would like them to focus more on her computer skills, since she has so many-as well as her reading skills because her receptive language has been tested as being almost age-appropriate. They did document it on the IEP, but more of a \"lesser goal\", and the head of the meeting scoffed a bit on such things as my bringing up Taylor\'s ability to tell time-she simply put down that Taylor would begin using a calendar to recognize schedules, but wouldn\'t put down that Taylor could tell time and could go by a clock to know a routine and get ready for a class at a specific time.</P> <P>I also asked that, she OT work on her pencil and pen skills-they stopped working on her writing, since they gave her the AT Springboard to communicate with. I told them that, she also needs to be able to write words as well-but that was dismissed because she will always have AT and, they added they would work on her writing, but it wasnt on their main goal list.</P> <P>I am proud of Taylor. I have said, from day one that, she knew things more than she displayed and that, she understood me fine at home, without me talking in \"baby talk\" (which, I noticed a couple of paras did when talking to her), and could follow 4-5 step commands easily. Yet, they were amazed on how much she knew? I wonder how much I have said in past meetings was dismissed as me being a parent in denial, instead of me knowing what my child can do?</P> <P>The only GOOD thing about all of the outcome of this was that, they are going to send home her AT Springboard so she can now communicate with me, using words instead of gestures or \"mom\'s psychic ability\". I am going in on Friday for training before she comes home with it.</P> <P>I guess I am just upset that, her strengths are put down but she is still being trained to be \"productive\" in society with manual, tedious tasks versus her strengths in cognitive and academic areas. Am I really in denial when I believe the way that I do-that we are as disabled as someone makes us? Am I asking too much for her skills to be enhanced in areas like computers, where she could actually have a job some day working on computer-related employment? Or, do I just let them continue letting her crush cans and shred paper, working cafeteria type work, and just acknowledge that she has other skills as well?</P> <P>I am feeling relatively stupid right now, and it breaks my heart to think, Taylor\'s abilities are discounted because of her outward symptoms being so apparent. </P> <P>Thanks for listening and, any suggestions or comments appreciated.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Colin/Taylor ASD, Molly, Sean(SD)/Ryan</div>'

'I just mean she has goals that they arent addressing and going to downgrade her IEP to just a speech IEP and the ST is going to develop the IEP. They did an IQ test, intelligence test with pictures so it would show my daughters potential and my daughter scored average range and one area was above average. But overall my daughter is in the average range of intelligence. After this the IEp is developed but they arent addressing her goals for self help and potty goals just downgrading to just speech. They arent working on her social goals at all either, and the picture schedules that need to be in the IEP wont be in there anymore, things like this will be gone. They are giving her OT and PT and they would be through the IU, so i have no idea why they are doing this to my daughter. I was going to have a meeting with the special education director but is this something i just write to her about first and ask for the comprehensive eval? Will this cover all areas?

'<P><IMG src=\"http://www.geocities.com/stnektarios/autism.bmp\" border=\"0\"></P> <P>THE VALUE OF A RELATIONSHIP BASED APPROACH&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<BR>by Dan L. Edmunds, M.A., B.C.S.A., Ed.D (abd)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<BR>In aiding children with developmental challenges, we must first realize that this requires a team effort and a strengths based approach. It is necessary to not focus on what the child cannot do but look at what the child can accomplish and build upon this. Parents can enlist the support of professionals but must realize that it is they who are the most important persons in the child\'s life and that furthering the development of their child is not just the work of professionals but is a collaborative effort from everyone involved with the child. It is neccessary that for any interventions to truly be effective and helpful, that they must be consistent and constant. The interventions must be the same throughout all domains that the child is present in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<BR>It is crucial for us to understand the environmental responses that children have, whether they have developmental concerns or even if they do not. If a teacher, parent, or other person has a hostile tone, a poor demeanor, a loud voice, etc. All of these things can be overwhelming to the child and can provoke a behavioral response. All behavior is purposeful and should be looked upon as so, even negative behaviors. Behaviors are a way of the child speaking to us about a distressing situation or an apparent need or desire when they may not be able to convey this to us verbally. Light, sound, and other sensory stimuli can also produce distress for a child. We need to create awareness of what in the environment may serve as triggers to distress and seek to modify the environment to make it a more comfortable and safe place for the child. We must also be cautious in how we view children. If we look at a child displaying negative behavior as a \'monster\' or feel that because a child may be rambunctious at times that we must automatically resort to medicating them, then we have taken a negativistic attitude that will surely be passed on to the child. Children are keenly aware, even those with communication struggles, of adult\'s perceptions of them. We should look at our children through the eyes of delight and address behavioral difficulties not in terms of how we can subdue, but rather how we can meet needs and resolve conflict and remove distress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<BR>The floor time model is of particular usefulness in working with children with communication and social struggles. For those children who are non-verbal, we can begin to introduce hand signals, moving to use of pictures, and then gradually encouraging the child to make use of words or phrases to indicate desires. It is not important initially whether the verbalizations are correct but rather that a verbal attempt was made. When a child displays such a behavior as spinning objects, in the floor time model, we would not be aversive, but rather gently introduce a new toy or object and seek to divert the child to a more productive activity. In situations of echolalia, we can say such things as \'that\'s TV talk\', and provide means to divert this to a different means of conversing. It is important to provide the child with understandable signals and meaningful statements and phrases when we are desiring them to behave in a different way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<BR>In order for children with developmental concerns to be able to integrate more into the social sphere, it is necessary that they not be isolated into situations where they are labeled and shuffled away from typical peers. Rather, they should be included as much as possible with typical peers. They may need additional support and accomodations, but how will they begin to learn important skills unless they have frequent and continuous exposure to the world around them. I have developed the use of what I term \'real life rehearsals\', where we may set up a particular social scenario for a child. It may be such a thing as being able to make a purchase at the grocery store. The therapist and parents guide and coach the child ahead of time in how to go about such an activity and then have them actually demonstrate it. Social stories and comic strip conversations are very useful in conveying information as these children tend to be visual learners. Social stories can be simply made booklets that the child helps to create where a particular task or scenario is outlined with what behaviors are expected. The comic strip conversation is helpful in building empathic skills as well as reflective thinking as we ask the child to develop captions for what different individuals may state and think in various situations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<BR>Lastly, I think it is crucial, though it may appear controversial to some, to state that children with developmental concerns can and will be benefitted from a psycho-social and relationship based approach alone. Some have decided to resort to medications, and I am placing no blame or condemnation on those who have made this decision, however making a suggestion that there are alternatives and informing of these alternatives as well as the hazards of psycotropic medication usage. First, I will not argue that medications can \'work\' in the sense of subduing behavior. However, strapping a child to a chair would also work in regards to subduing behavior. This would be aversive and quite possible illegal. I see little difference between such an approach and that of using psychiatric medication. The difference is that one is a physical restraint, the other a chemical restraint. When we say that something \'works\', often we are not looking at the mechanism by which it works. Dr. Peter R. Breggin, MD compared the use of antipsychotic medications in children to \'chemical lobotomy\' as it blunts the functions of the frontal lobes. Thr risk of tardive dyskinesia, a permanent disfiguring neurological impairment exists with these drugs. In addition, such drugs as Risperdal are prescribed off label and are not indicated for anyone below the age of 18 but continue to be prescribed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<BR>It may require more diligence, effort, and patience, but I remain convinced after working with over 40 children with developmental challenges, that relationship based approaches, rather than chemical restraint, prove to be a true means to teach our children skills, to focus on their strengths, to build on their development, and to help address challenging behaviors and to address the real source of conflict and distress rather than just blunting it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</P> <P><BR>***Dan L.

'Yes yes yes! She would want a letter! With no disrespect to anyone, I hardly never receive even a \"thank you\" from many of the parents of students I teach. I would rather that than anything!'
'There are other ways to babysit kids that LOOK like they are doing schoolwork but it\'s just busywork. My own bugaboo is word searches. What a huge waste of my son\'s time. But someone looking into the room would never know his time was being wasted. Of course, I know that teachers sometimes need administrative time or need to pay more intense attention to others in the classroom, so they use these things to occupy the kids. But I think that there are some types of busywork that are more useful than others. In our case, my son has a one-on-one aide who could supervise some more useful exercise. Like asking him to look up words in the dictionary. My son doesn\'t see word searches as fun and dictionary as hard work. To him, it\'s all the same - paperwork. And he\'s totally willing to do it. In the case of kids in a classroom where a video is going to be shown, I\'d rather see the aides conduct a game like BINGO. Of course, some classes are filled with kids who could not attend to a group game or that lacks extra adults. A video, once in awhile, won\'t kill anyone. But there may be opportunities to fill a kids\' time with more socially interactive activities, which would really be more helpful to our kids. Of course, I\'m not the teacher who has to arrange all of this with a bunch of high-maintenance kids and not enough support.'

He is on meds. and he is doing wonderful with him. Well we have been told by his teacher that their is NO problems with him whatsoever he\'s an average student and is socially fine. But when I have observed him its not like that at all. Nor is it like that anywhere else. He is acdemically advanced for his age but are stating that he functions reading Dr. Seuss so why push. He is able to due 1+1 so why push the issue. He needs social skills and 1 on 1 . But the school is saying he\'s fine don\'t push. Lets just wait and see what happens. We already at home have been teaching him signing just incase he was to loose his words as his younger brother did so that he still can have a communication.

'RE: Aiding - It is really hard to do well. But there are those who are good at it and make it look easy. One trick is to know exactly how much aiding to do. If the kid is not struggling <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">a bit</span> then he\'s not really learning. The trick is training. Also, the aide has to know how to not put herself between the child and the teacher. She has to refer to the teacher all the time and not directly answer questions herself. The teacher needs to be on board to cooperate with this to make it work.<br><br>The problem we experienced is that even when we got an aide in a General Ed class (through legal means) none of the staff were committed to making it work. At first the school was helping, but when they got word from the SpEd management, they stopped supporting in the classroom and we had to pull out son and the aide out to avoid the hostile environment. You can ask what sort of SpEd department that puts getting its own way ahead of the welfare of the kid, and I will have no answer.<br> OTOH were I live the special ed classes are not much more than fancy baby sitting unless you are on their case 24/7. So that\'s why we fought so hard to stay out. Incidentally for my son, inclusion has gone from 100% (K) to 30% (1st) to 10% (2nd). The District claims inclusion during recess and lunch to bump the number up to 10%, but I\'m not sure that just breathing the same air has educational benefit. So realistically the number is 0% these days, and we see no end in sight. His social skills are deteriorating to match the worst behavior in his classroom since that is all he sees for most of his day.<br><br>In our case what it took to get the aide was for the District to admit in the IEP meeting, on tape, that the placement had been predetermined and they had not even looked at our outside reports. (I got PO\'d during the meeting and asked \"Did you even <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">look</span> at our outside report?\", and the school psych said that he did not need to.) Other parents in my District have been successful with a good evaluation showing it to be necessary, and then due process with a good lawyer. However, the local SpEd head has a reputation among parents so YMMV.<br><br>IMHO you should start looking into the other options such as private school and the like so that you can see what could be done that is someplace between general ed with an aide and the fully excluded class. My guess from your post is that these are the only options that anyone has talked about, and it sounds like it is time to think outside of the box. We are started in that direction since our District has decided to stop working with us. We no longer find out what is going on in the classroom since it supports our outside evaluator\'s assessment that the placement is not a FAPE. But it has been an eye opener to see what folks can do if they put their minds to it.<br> <br><div class=\'post_sig\'>- It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it - U Sinclair  We choose to go to the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard - JFK</div>'

'<P>We\'ve had great bike success here. My dh read a book on biking with kids and there was a chapter on teaching your child to ride a bike. It was a different approach than I had ever seen and I must admit I was a bit skeptical. At the end of last summer dh took training wheels off the bikes and had both boys riding two wheelers like pros within 1 - 2 hours. No falls. It was amazing. (Note that C does not have any gross motor issues, his skills in that area are on par with his NT twin.)</P> <P>I\'ll try and summarize the technique.</P> <P>1. Get your own bike out and lower the seat so that both of your feet are flat on the ground when your butt is in the seat. Then take the training wheels off of the childs bike and lower the seat as low as it will go.</P> <P>2. Show the child how to sit on the seat and pick both feet up off the ground and try to balance. Count out loud how many seconds the child balances with no feet on the ground. Make a game of it. Demonstrate how turning the handebar can help balance. Once the child can balance with both feet off of the ground for 5 seconds, move on to step 3. (You are ignoring pedals throughout this entire step. Feet should be in the air.)</P> <P>3. Show the child how to glide forward on the bike by taking \"giant steps.\" This is basically gliding the bike forward, butt in seat, by taking giant steps with alternating feet. This is why it is important to start with child\'s seat at lowest level. If seat is too high it is impossible to do this step. Once child is comfortable moving up and down the driveway like this, move on to step 4.</P> <P>4. Have the child take 3 - 4 giant steps to get going, and then have the child pick their feet off the ground like they did in step 2 and glide with feet in the air. Count out loud how many seconds the child glide without their feet on the ground. Make a game of it. (Note, we are still ignoring pedals, feet should be in the air.) Once the child can glide for 8 - 10 seconds without putting a foot on the ground, go on to step 5.</P> <P>5. Have the child take 3 - 4 giant steps to get going, and have them pick their feet up like in step 4 and then tell them to start to pedal! Once they get good at pedaling, start raising the seat up a bit to a normal height.</P> <P>The key to this approach is to get the child comfortable balancing on a bike before teaching the child to pedal. The old \"run, push and let go\" technique requires the child to learn to balance and pedal simulaneously and typically results in many falls, which can scare a child and make them not want to try again.</P> <P>I know that tackling the bike issue is a big challenge for those with kids who have gross motor issues. It may take a long time to get through the above steps. However I think this approach is really good for ASD kids because it breaks the complex task into simpler skills and then builds on them. It also greatly reduces the risk of falling/injury. </P> <P>If anyone has questions on this or wants to discuss further, please PM me and I can give you my phone number and you can talk to dh. He\'s the resident expert in our home and can probably explain much better than me!</P> <P> </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Kristy  Mom to 10 year old twin boys (1 PDD-NOS, 1 ADHD)</div>'

'Hi everyone! I\'ve sniffed around here for info a few times, and now that my 3.5 year old has been diagnosed with pdd, I\'m back for your help. <br /> <br />Joe was evaluated this past fall, per his preschool teacher\'s recommendation. We had had him evaluated by EI twice, at 18 months and at 2.5 years for language delays and sensory issues, but he did not qualify. <br /> <br />His reports returned with significant at-risk behaviors, especially social and sensory issues. His cognitive development was considered a little above average, as was his receptive and expressive language (although functional language is another thing!). He was provided with 5 hours with a Special Ed one-on-one in the classroom (he attends 3 mornings a week) and 2x 30 with an OT. These services began on Jan. 8th. The committee chair strongly suggested that we seek out a diagnosis from a neurologist, because they couldn\'t justify more services with his high Ed and Language scores. <br /> <br />Now that he\'s been diagnosed with pdd <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"> and I\'ve read up on what he needs, I\'ve asked the CPSE to reconvene for a new IEP. Here\'s the thing: He LOVES his school, and now that he has a SE-IT with him, he\'s making progress.But not GREAT progress. There\'s room in a new afternoon program at a lovely and well regarded school for the developmentally disabled, and we\'re hoping to get him in there as well. Classes start on Monday, and our meeting is on Wednesday, so he\'d have to start on Thurs. <br /> <br />I\'m sure he\'ll be approved for the new class, but I can\'t bear to take him out of his morning program. He\'s actually been interacting with his classmates lately, and he just loves his routine there. They are not a special ed. school and will not keep him without the Special Ed Itinerant. I feel that pulling him out of where\'s he\'s comfortable, while putting him in a brand new place, will be too much change for him and we\'ll lose ground.I\'d like him to keep his SE-IT until June, attend afternoons at the new place,then transition to full time at the new school in the fall. <br /> <br />So, to make a long story longer - Do I have a chance? Anyone with experience have any advice for me at the meeting? Any strategies? <br /> <br />Thanks!

It helps to introduce those who are on the team but either haven\'t met him yet or who don\'t have daily involvement with him and makes it more personal - more about his needs than about the mechanics of the meeting.

'<P>jdecina\'s post emphasizes somethign important: the theory only works as well, in any case, as the teachers who implement it. Go observe a classroom. Good teachers make or break any daycare classroom, regardless of theory.</P> <P>And of course it helps to have an administration that has both money and the know-how to utilize it effectively.</P> <P>My DS went to the same preschool as DD for a year and a half. His experience was VERY different from hers and I felt it was due to both administration AND teachers. One teacher in his room had a negative attitude and was overwhelmed. She \"pushed\" potty training, to my disappointment, and made it clear that other things going on in DS\'s life (he was adopted one yr earlier, at 2, we had just moved to a new house) were not relevant to her. We trained him, but it was very difficult for him. A couple months more before we started might have really helped him handle it more positively. After we had begun triaining him I was in the classroom one morning and heard a child (a normally pleasant and well-adjusted one) screaming and crying as a teacher held him on the potty. I was not sure why this was happening but obviously it added a great deal to the tension of the room.</P> <P>So ... don\'t look at the administrators\' \"favorite\" classroom, either, but the class your child would enroll in. </P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by foxl on July 05 2007 at 12:59pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Linda  mom to T, 9, ASD  S, 7, ADHD  A, 6 so far so good ...  we are an adoptive family</div>'

'Evaluations are good for a year (typically) so they might drag out the 1 year - a bit evaluation and claim that it is still valid. But you could have disagreed with it (if you had a reason to) the same day that you got the evaluation and asked for the IEE. So having the old evaluation does not stop you from asking for an IEE. What will stop you is that the district may decide to defend its evaluation in due process hearing. So if you expect that it would be best to go over the evaluation and find areas that you disagree with and why so you will have something for the sue process hearing.<br><br>But my question would be why start the IEE process now?

'<P>I don\'t know what your state laws are (tzoya is from NY and hopefully will see this post) - but in a lot of states you can sign a philosophical waiver stating you object to vaccinations on a philosophical basis. Most states offer a medical waiver and a religious waiver. Personally, I could technically sign a religious waiver because I\'m Catholic and some vaccinations (can\'t remember which - it might be all) have something in them that are from aborted fetuses. School districts (from what I understand) seem to \"get\" that one. If you feel your religion is anti-abortion, you might be able to use that one.</P> <P>I personally feel that if you feel your child has been harmed by vaccines that you should not be required to vaccinate him/her again - unless it could be done safely (which I don\'t know how they would prove). I do believe in vaccinating to SOME extent - I think we go way overboard in this country, however. My kids have all the vaccines required for their school, but will get no more. And my dd never gets more than one at a time now. My ds hasn\'t gotten more than one at a time in the last two years.

He is on a 504 plan and receives instruction at home, but can attend school when his symptoms are manageable. However, when he goes to school he can not go outside when the temperature is below 40 degrees or higher than 80 and he must receive a nebulizer treatment every four hours. Would you believe that the school expected him to not only know when he can go outside but also remember to go to the nurse to receive his treatment?!!!</P> <P>Well, Monday he \"forgot\" that it was cold outside and also \"forgot\" to go have his treatment. Needless to say he was in horrendous shape when he got home from school and only today is he starting to respond to treatment. </P> <P>I have the greatest respect for teachers. I can\'t imagine how burdensome it must be to deal with all of the special needs of our kids - not only autism, but asthma, peanut allergies, diabetes, etc. However, common sense must tell you that a seven or eight year old child (NT or not) can not consistently remember to go where they are supposed to go, when they are supposed to go. I feel for T, it just doesn\'t seem fair. My case is much less complex than yours because I merely had to remind the school of the liability they have created with this \"system\" and they were quick to schedule a meeting to design a no fault system to assure that the doctor\'s recommendations are followed without fail.</P> <P>I know we had exchanged posts in the past about our respective second grade teachers expecting our kids to remember their books, homework, etc and being resistent to checklists and picture schedules. I sincerely hope that you can quickly find a way to relieve T the responsibilities imposed on her because I agree, they are entirely unfair and unrealistic. </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>-   Mom of 9 y/o ds with Cystic Fibrosis and 4 y/o dd with PDD-NOS</div>'

'<P>Meg</P> <P>A couple things first off where do you live? You should have a special services division of your county that can help advocate for you. Also if your child was ever in a birth to three program call your FRC even though your child is no longer in the program alot of times they will pay legal fees and will help in resolving situations like this. Also schools are required by law under the No Child Left Behind statue that they must provide evaluation and placement in the program in a timely manner. I would definetly talk to the school board and let them know that this is not acceptable they need to solve this issue or else you will contact a lawyer. Typically if a child qualifies for speech or occupational therapy recommended by a doctor then they should also qualify with the school as well. The school district we are in actually took all of the evals we had done on my oldest and read through them and then made it so that some of the goals that we use in speech and OT are the same as the private pay goals. </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Courage is being scared to death - and saddling up anyway! -John Wayne    Mom to two beautiful boys with ASD ages six and nine</div>'

'<P>I think it is not uncommon for a diagnosis to change. Many people have kids who have gone for years with changing diagnoses - they start out with ADHD, move to ODD, then add OCD and finally end up with Asperger\'s - for one example. Doctors aren\'t perfect and the DSM (which is the diagnostic bible) is being revised every few years (okay, more like every 7-10) because we find out new information about disorders. </P> <P>In the dev ped practice we went to, there was one doc who did not believe in PDD-NOS and almost never diagnosed a child as having Asperger\'s. He would only diagnose kids who had \"classic\" autism. The other doc was VERY liberal in diagnosing and he was the doc to go to if you had a high-functioning child. Which is why we went to him. So, we could have ended up with the other doc and still be searching for answers. Thankfully, we\'re not.</P> <P>What is your ds\' educational diagnosis on his IEP? If you want it changed to autism (so that he can get services that are appropriate for his disorder like social skills training) then he needs to be evaluated for autism. </P> <P>I would strongly suggest contacting a local parent support group for autism - they will have good ideas as to how your school district is. In my opinion, it is best for schools to know your child has autism so that they can make accommodations and provide services that are appropriate for your child. My ds is very high-functioning, has above-average intelligence and his receptive and expressive language have always been good. But, he needs services - social skills, OT, DAPE and time in the ASD room for rest time. Could he function without these? Yes, probably. But, he would probably be getting frustrated and not wanting to go to school. He likes going to school and does well there - because supports are in place for him. It is a place he feels comfortable. We have completely open communication with the ASD teacher and I talk frequently with his kindergarten teacher as well.</P> <P>Good luck with this - and keep us posted!</P> <P>Edited to add: Oh - I forgot to say that I am always loquacious - so I apologize for my horribly long posts! <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley9.gif\" border=\"0\"></P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by snoopywoman on April 01 2008 at 2:52pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS (9 yo) diagnosed with mild PDD-NOS and DD (6 yo) NT - but definitely a challenge!</div>'

'<P>DS just started 2nd grade in September. Today I had a parent/teacher conference today with his teacher and the Special Ed teacher today, his 1:1 aide who is with DS at all times wasn\'t there at the meeting. So far I like both of these teachers and I am very happy with both of them. The meeting went amazingly well, even better than I thought it was going to go. There weren\'t any surprises or anything that had to tell me about DS that would make me want to burst into tears. The only concern that I have is that both teachers said that his aid has been asked to help other children who are not in his class. The regular classroom teacher told the principal that leaving DS unassisted without his 1:1 aide at any time of the day is totally unacceptable, except for when the aide has her break and lunch. If the aide is out sick, then plan if for DS to spend most of the day with the Sped teacher. Both teachers suggested that I say something to the principal about this in a nonaccusatory way, such as how well DS is doing with his 1:1 aide, how succesful he has been so far this year, how much I appreciate him having the aide. I feel like I should not have to do this because his 1:1 aide in his IEP and has been since his yearly IEP meeting that was held in June 2004 for 1st grade, at that time I had an Educational Attourney at my side for that meeting to fight for a 1:1 aide for DS. I spent alot of money and fought hard to get him his 1:1 aide, so it\'s not like they are doing us any favor. We all know that our kids IEPs are not always followed.

'The training part of the bus staff is critical. We have never \"knock on wood\" had any issues with the bus....John loves it....and we have add great staff. However, we have a bus issue with my guys at school. There are 3 of my boys on one particular bus and it is a small bus with a monitor and driver....but about 10 kids total. All have autism or other behavioral issues. Their ride is 1 hour to our school. We had a great driver and aide for about 1/2 the school year. Even so, one of my guys had trouble on the bus (tantrums, aggression, etc) so I met with the bus staff several times (with my principal) and we wrote a behavior plan and had several more meetings and trainings and the child was successful on the bus! The key was the driver and aide were invested in the kids. In January there were contract issues and the driver and aide were changed and the bus has been a mess ever since. Then there were administrative changes in the district and the whole thing got worse. My kids parents got together and called the CSE chair (who was new but from a district I had worked with) and he called me last week and asked if I would help the district to set up training and programs for the kids on the buses with him. Now, I need to get approval to do that since I work for another agency.....but I am so glad this guy \"gets it\"....and the students will hopefully have a really successful year!!!'

'Most kids with PDD-NOS, especially young ones, ARE at risk for regression over the summer. PDD-NOS is a severe disability and most kids qualify for ESY, especially at a young age. Regression includes far more than academics. It includes getting out of the routine, behaviors, social skills, etc., all of which are much more heavily focused on during the summer when academics are not the issue. Be happy.'
'They sound like they are taking the easy way out. There can be <br />consequences for some behaviors, but are they teaching him replacement <br />behavior? Are they helping find words to express himself when he is <br />upset? Sending him to the back of the line doesn\'t teach him what to do <br />next time, nor does taking away recess.

'I have talked to some parents and Teachers who don\'t like the type of results that ABA give. One of the specialists at Sharlets Early Learning Centre (who has had huge success using play based therapies with Sharlet) has told me that over the years some parents have chosen ABA over attending EL in their kids early years. She said that when they do come to EL when they are transitioning into Kinder, they are really hard to teach skills that are needed in the real world. She said they are often like little robots who have speech but it\'s automated and often rigid and doesn\'t make sense, for eg Hello \"child\" \"hello.....I\'m good\" even though you didn\'t ask how they are they answer like that because their therapist always asks how they are. She said that often it appears that the child doesn\'t necessarily understand a lot of what they are taught, and that teaching them the things they need at school is often hard if ABA has been the only method of intervention. She didn\'t say it can\'t be useful but she said it needs to be used in conjunction with other therapies.<br><br>I am only saying what I was told, of course I don\'t claim to know first hand as I haven\'t used it. Also from the things I have read on here I think ABA in the US might be different to what we have here.

'Be aware that getting an IEE will allow you to get a good evaluation by an outside (the educational system) person who is less likely to be biased. It you will finally get what your child needs, not what the District want to give you. Of course, the district will do <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">anything</span> to stop that. I have seen tap-dancing around the truth and attempts to tie me in knots. Although my experiences so far have not included out-right lying.<br><br>However my experience does include a couple of outside evaluators who start smelling contract money and will do just about anything the District asks to get the contract, including refusing to say something on record that that they have said off record for years. This experience has made me want to vomit in their waiting room. So ask around to get a feel for other parents\' prior experience about who you can trust.<br><br>What you need to do is ask the District for their written policies and procedures for getting an IEE. I found <a href=\"http://www.sccoe.org/depts/selpa/docs/ProceduralHdbk.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a> on the web, the IEE policy starts on page 373. That would be as Adobe reader numbers the pages. Internally on the document it is page 14-23. It is a large document and may load slowly. Note that this is full of state specific stuff, you\'ll probably need to find one locally for your state. This document lists the necessary qualifications of the outside evaluators and so on. Note that the qualification in the document are much higher than what the districts use themselves. This gives you some leverage to get a qualified person. I searched our local policy manual out after finding that they were using it to try and stop my son\'s IEE.<br><br>As for costs, I imaging that the amount you were quoted probably will get you a blank stare. You might try asking them for a list of folks who will do an evaluation and then phone around (maybe from the list, maybe not, you get to decide since its an IEE) and see if you can find anyone willing to do a proper evaluation for that amount. If not, come back to the district and very politely point out that there is no one willing to do the job for that amount and their policy is making it impossible to get the IEE.<br><br><div class=\'post_sig\'>- It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it - U Sinclair  We choose to go to the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard - JFK</div>'

'Robin, I agree with kacarac, You need to get an advocate. Does your child have an IEP? IF no, then the school needs to do one for your child,even if he is straight A\'s Your child can be in regular classroom and still have an IEP for behavior. Your child has a disibility that effects his function at school. A child with a disibility is to be educated in the school that the student would attend if not disabled. That is the Law.

'<P>I don\'t think you\'re a bad teacher. I understand you get the kids you get and put in alot of effort, commitment and care into your kids. My issue is with the standpoint that segregated classes are more beneficial for kids than being among the regular community. I think you\'d be a great teacher in an environment that provided more opportunities but the parameters aren\'t in your control. </P> <P>My point about envelope stuffing is that these kids have already lost opportunity by being taken out of mainstream opportunities in grade 1, 2,3... and are being denied opportunity for anything else by 12 years old. </P> <P>Along the same line, I don\'t understand why they are being taught not to throw markers in grade 6. To me, they should have had this opportunity long long ago. But, many kids are automatically streamed into segregated classes \"for their own good\" as they enter school. </P> <P>\"Lifeskills\" and grocery store trips etc. are outdated teaching based on the institutionalization of ppl and reintegrating them into the community because those opportunities were denied to them. Ppl in institutions were not provided access to grocery stores, laundry and cooking, planning their own lives, or public transportation in their daily lives. The reason for teaching \"lifeskills\" was because ppl were devoid of natural opportunities. Why would a child in a regular home need to go to school to go to the grocery store when they\'ve been going since they were born? </P> <P>If my older daughter waited for some integration by grade 6, she\'d have severe issues in behavior as well as meeting the expectations of a regular class. I don\'t think segregated classes help kids learn how to perform in the real world - I think they\'re taken out of the game and then it\'s used against them when they they can\'t prove they can perform. Real classrooms go to the library, eat lunch, and do all the things that real people are expected to do. Real parents teach their real kids real everyday functional things even if they work to pay bills. </P> <P>I do have another daughter who has learned PECs and toilet trained in regular ed. She was far from an angel - closer to tasmanian devil when she started regular school 3 years ago. She\'s learned the rules of the classroom, strategies and consequences from participation and with tools and supports. She is nonverbal and uses ASL and a speech device and her peers in her class learn ASL. The kids in the neighborhood know her and go on her bus. The EA, FM system, classroom visuals, clear positive instruction, and teacher behavior training all assist the typical students in her class as well. </P> <P>There is an assumption that nonverbal kids are LF that is too prevalent. The same assumption was made at one time of children with blindness and deafness. Tools, supports and opportunities in the real world make a real world of difference. It\'s every child\'s right and shouldn\'t be so easily taken away. </P> <P> </P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by OZZIE-ROZIES-MA on December 20 2009 at 5:17pm</span>'

'<P>Hi Marilyna,</P> <P> BTDT over and over again. Reasons include: He is not happy here; he is not matured enough; he needs more than we can provide etc. Anyways what doesn\'t kill you make you stronger. There are pros and cons to keeping your ds at home. We kept ds at home for about 3 yrs running a homebased program. He did very well with receptive lang, way better than he would have done in what our sp ed offered. We were able to potty train as well. Academically he did great as well. It would have been good if we had had the opportunity to expose him to typically developing peers. The rejections were so difficult. We ended up doing without that. I know he would be more advanced socially if we had been able to do that. So from my own experience, I would suggest that if you run a home based program and keep your ds at home (there are lots of benefits to it.) Exposing him to maybe about 8-12 hrs of typical peers in addition to the Sp Ed program would make things more rounded.</P> <P>Our kids do get better. Your ds will get better with expressing himself and self regulation. Do not feel bad. I know I feel terrible after these incidents. Just know it is not your fault.</P> <P>Concernedpa.</P>'

'<P>Just a note to say thank you for your replies, advice and direction. I have been silent the past couple of weeks because this situation has consumed a tremendous amount of time, but I do have an update.</P> <P>We had the \"imperative\" IEP today. Prior to attending I consulted and hired a wonderful Advocate. She was worth everything I paid her today and so much more! I also consulted with an attorney as well as the Michigan Protection and Advocacy Services. I read their publication Special Education: An Advocate\'s Manual along with Wright\'s law. I wouldn\'t say that I\'m well versed, but I at least know the language. What happened today was positive. We (myself and the advocate) accomplished what we set out today to do; but this is far from over...The superintendent (who is the person driving this whole thing) tried to come to the meeting. He was not on the Invitation list provided by the school to attend the meeting therefore by law we had the right to ask him to leave or we would \"table\" the meeting. My advocate gave him the news, and he very sacrastically said to me in front of witnesses \"You\'ll notice that we are cooperating with you. But if you want to play games I\'ll play your game.\" Those of us standing there just smiled and shook our heads, and I politely said, \"This is not a game Mr.............. This is the law.\" He walked off to his office. This has been his tactic since before Christmas - to bully and intimidate me through his words and emails. He has been unresponsive to my request for information and has tried to scare me at every corner into backing down.</P> <P>The problem is not just a funding issue, but the district has made numerous mistakes on the IEP forms, evaluation and have failed to implement the 504 Plan. I have been legally advised that we have a civil rights case for retaliation. Believe it or not, this whole thing is over us advocating for a room change for our son. His present gen ed teacher is not capable of understanding and implementing accommodations for my son. There is another teacher who is well versed in ASDs and sensory integration which is where we have requested that our son be. Both the principal and the superintendent have told us that this would be in the best interest of everyone. When they thought we were going to withdraw our son, we were told that if he were going to stay changing his classroom would be a \"simple solution.\" One that could be done in a day or two. Well, we didn\'t withdraw our son and now...well, now its not such a simple solution anymore??? hmmmm???? In fact today after we had to table the IEP meeting because there was conflicting information regarding the purpose of the meeting, we (principal, special ed director, myself, advocate and overseeing ISD special ed director) began discussing what the true issues were and how to resolve. When my advocate stated that a room change was a must, the principal said, \"Oh, that will be a problem.\" Those involved in my case cannot believe that a superintendent is willing to take a district down a path of official hearings that he very well could lose as well as be exposed to a civil rights action, all because he does not want to grant my request for a room change. Hopefully, now that someone from the overseeing district is involved, who by the way, was very resaonable, maybe they can advise the superintendent of what is in the best interest of the school and more importantly my son. We have also garnered the attention of our state representative. Next step the school board.</P> <P>I\'m learning alot! But as always, I am appalled by the human nature of some people. I say this tongue-n-cheek but everyone should live by the principles written in the little book, \"All I Needed to Know in Life, I Learned in Kindergarten.\"</P>'
'<P>Hello all. I am hoping for some feedback on this. My son with PDD, Luke, is 5 and in his second year in a spec. ed class in public school. His teacher is great, but this is a very poor district in all senses of the word. This self-contained class is very overcrowded and Luke does not get the individual attention he needs. He needs more speech therapy, music therapy and most of all, inclusion with NT kids. We have asked for this but been shot down. I know some of you will say fight and make them give Luke what he needs, but we have tried and are tired and frustrated. We see two options now - move to a better district or find a private school for special needs kids. Do any of you have your SE kids in private school? How is it? Is it expensive? (One school I looked at was $1,000 a month!) I went back to work as an English teacher this fall, so we have more money but not much.

Natural consequences do not affect her, she has big difficulties getting along with peers and seems to be completely preoccupied by her surroundings(what her classmates are doing, how they\'re doing it, are her crayons lined up perfectly, are her socks on her feet the right way, are her barretts tight enough...you get the idea) , to the point that her work is not getting done in an acceptable amount of time or at all.</P> <P>At home her behavior has become increasingly volatile. She is flying off the handle several times a day about doing tasks that in the past she has done with little complaint...some things like eating and going potty have always been an issue. She went through a stage similar to this when she was 3, but I chalked it up to a change in environment. We moved to a different home and my husband moved in with us prior to our wedding, she had never had a man living under her roof(she was too young to remember her real dad living with us).

She has an appointment for a dev ped at the end of the month and I requested a school eval be done...that brings me to present </P> <P>I have a ppt meeting for my dd on Thursday and I\'m feeling a little underprepared for it. The first school meeting I had consisted of them trying to talk me out of having her evaluated:( I am wondering if this is common. They argued that they only treat academic issues not social and that since she was only in half day kindy that there was a limited amount they could even do for her. Both these statments struck me as odd. Don\'t social deficits contribute to academic problems? I know in her case they ARE. And aren\'t they required to help her even if she is only in school 1/2 a day?</P> <P>They wanted to wait to start evals until we had had a private one done. I pushed the issue and said that I would prefer to have all my bases covered and have the ball rolling on several things at once.

'My daughter started when she was eight years old. Right before she turned 9. I had always been open with her and when I found out she was in precocious puberty I made sure to keep telling her to expect it. She still screamed when it happened and swore that she hated her life. I still have a difficult time with her because she refuses to tell anyone else. Her teachers namely. She home schooled last year and when I started her back I decided to keep her in third grade because of academic and social reasons. But, now she is the size of a 12 year old with all the maturity issues to go with it and yet her emotional level is right on with the third graders. She also has developed acne and towers above the other students in her class. She is 5 foot 1. So she generally feels like a freak. It\'s not easy. I feel for her so much. I just keep telling her that we love her and that in a few years she is gonna be so happy that she already went through this. I don\'t really know how it will be, but that is what I keep telling her. we are still trying to figure out if she is on the spectrum. She has alot of issues and has a chronic tic syndrome so I know your worries about how she will handle things. But, you know, she and you will get through it. It may be difficult, but you will. We are. Sometimes the anticipation of the unforseen is actually worse than the actual event. Not, that it wasn\'t traumatic, but you just deal the best way you can.

'<P>In the hierarchy of Least Restrictive Environment, BOCES is between a public school and an approved private school. In some states I think they are called a county schools. BOCES runs special ed programs and vocational programs, so they are trade schools, too. They run adult ed programs for which they charge tuition in some locations. </P> <P>Most schools in NY send kids to BOCES when they don\'t want to deal with those kids in District. Mostly this means kids who have severe disabilities or kids who have behaviors (either voluntary ones or involutary ones) that disturb the regular environment. Examples are loud Tourette\'s tics, aggression, unsafe behaviors like \"eloping.\" In NY, each school District varies vastly in size. Some SD\'s have 1,000 kids, some SD\'s have tens of thousands of kids. The tiny school districts simply don\'t have enough kids to form self-contained special ed classes of any kind, so they ship their 2 or 3 kids off to BOCES. Therefore, there are some BOCES classes for LD kids, etc. It\'s been my observation that SD\'s may send kids off to BOCES for one reason and even when that reason disappears, they are reluctant to take them back into the SD\'s. \"Once in BOCES, always in BOCES\" is not ironclad, but inertia makes that tend to happen.</P> <P>My son was placed in BOCES after 7th grade because of cycles of rage that occurred when the hormones hit. The HUGE secondary schools in our District were too much for him to handle. There are between 3,000 and 4,000 kids in our HS and the commotion just fed into his issues. The school definitely wanted to get rid of him, I definitely wanted him in an environment that was not feeding into his autism. Most school districts are anxious to rid themselves of kids with autism, so choosing a BOCES option is not a problem. Asking for out-of-District options becomes a problem when taking a kid out of the school District presents the S Ed dept. with the dilemma of where to put him. If you have an approved private school option already, you\'re halfway there. Make a case for why that is the Least Restrictive Environment for YOUR son. LRE is the only reason a child can legally be taken out of the mainstream. Tell the District EXACTLY the reasons you believe your son will only make educational progress in the school you want him to be in. That is the only way they will be able to approve the placement. Good luck.</P>'

'Another thing that might be helpful is getting a special toy ahead of time <br />and giving it to her on Tuesday morning. You can call it \"the bus toy\" or <br />something similar.

'<P>Things have been going pretty good in school but last week my son said he got in trouble. What I got out of him was that he and another little boy in class wernt listening during Library and missed recess and lunch. Since the things my son says isnt always what he means or what actually happened I wrote a note telling her what I heard happened and to clarify it. She wrote back that yes him and another boy were running around and being naughty so she followed thru with a loss of recess so he had a consequence for his actions. She went on to say that she was proud of him because he started to throw a fit but calmed down and followed her to \'the wall\' (like a time out) and also that he told me what happened so its great that hes communicating to me his actions.</P> <P>She never said anything about him loosing lunch so it made me think even more that it had happened. She also added that \"today\" he had been in trouble during music as well but went to the back of the line by himself (their punishment i guess) when he saw her and to please sign and return. I responded that I asked because of him loosing lunch not because of hs loss of recess and that I would like his behavioral log to be sent home everyday (she had stopped sending it home a few weeks ago and I assumed all was going great till now) because its still like pulling teeth to get info from him and then im not sure of it if i do get it but I didnt get any response about his lunch loss just a comment on how he was teary eyed today yet my son actually TOLD me himself that he was crying all day and was crying during PE and hit some boy who \'was being mean to him and racing\'. Im assuming the kid won a race and my son hit him but maybe the PE teacher didnt tell his teacher i dont know. I dont like the fact that it seems she avoiding the question instead of just answering it and she is always telling me how great he is because hes communicating things to me which i know is great progress and completely awesome but besides the point at this time.</P> <P>Now long story short, can they do this??? The only thing that i can find that comes close to it is the child loosing the privelidge to eat lunch in the cafeteria or the child loosing the privelidge to eat lunch on school campus but not denying it at all!

'<P>You are talking about two different things. Only physicians can give a MEDICAL diagnosis of autism, PDD-NOS or Asperger Syndrome (the three most common dx\'s on the Spectrum - the other two are so specialized, you\'d already know if your child had them). What schools give are a classification. In the United States, there is only one classification for any of the ASD\'s - Autism. That means, for example, if a child has a medical diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome, he may qualify for an educational classification of Autism. The school district does not have to recognize the doctor\'s diagnosis and automatically give the student an autism classification and an IEP. What they MUST do, though, is give the student a complete psychoeducational evaluation to determine whether the child qualifies as disabled, educationally, and in need of specialized instruction. \"Need\" includes the areas of academics, behavior and functionality. Getting a medical diagnosis is technically not necessary and having one doesn\'t guarantee that the school will give the IEP. </P> <P>IMHO, getting a classification from the schools is more important than getting the medical dx because the only real \"treatments\" for autism spectrum disorders is getting the child comprehensive educational interventions. Of course, a medical dx can make it easier to get the school to say \"yes,\" so it\'s probably smart to pursue both. Keep us posted</P>'

The consultant, the district hired to do his FBA and oversee it, got angry at the meeting and lashed out. The teacher (who I have made numerous complaints about) has not been implementing his BIP. She claims he doesn\'t \"want to do it,\" WTF?? She is the teacher, it\'s her JOB. She basically gave up after 3 weeks, and it was very obvious as the behavior consultant had her using a documentation notebook, which was almost empty, and I had already told the principal about this when it started happening. I\'m in the classroom a couple times a week volunteering and checking to see what she is doing for him, which is basically nothing.</P> <P>I also complained again about him not receiving any sensory OT, it\'s also in his IEP, as consult to the teacher, they are too cheap to provide direct services. She doesn\'t request the consult though, last year the OT brought in an air cushion, visual schedule and other devices, she put them away after a week, she claims he deflated the cushion a couple times and she \"wasn\'t going to reinflate it again.\" She wouldn\'t give me an answer about the other stuff. I stated that it was HER job to implement and teach him how to properly use the items, the room fell silent, and the meeting got even more tense and akward after that. I went on to describe, not for the first, or even third time, about how he is in the classroom rolling around on the floor, mouthing objects like glue bottles, desks, chairs, ect. I stated it\'s very obvious just by observing him that he has a great need for sensory OT, and asked why nothing has happened all year long to take care of this, and whose job is it to follow up on this? I got no answer, once again. I asked why, during every meeting do they \"brainstorm\" ideas for this and never implement anything? No answer.</P> <P>I asked yet again what is being planned to help him transition into first grade, which was supposed to be finally explained in this meeting. No answer, instead I was told that this would be addressed in the next meeting, which is to take place next school year! I have brought up several times his anxiety related to school, his fear of the multi-stall bathrooms, him crying himself to sleep on school nights, taking 2 to 4 hours to fall asleep on school nights, telling me every night and morning he is \"too sick to go to school today\", not eating all day at school, bedwetting on school nights only-not during vacations or weekends, having accidents at school, grinding his teeth at school, ect.</P> <P>Here is the real kicker though: my ed consultant was in this meeting, and all the others. He basically sat there and said almost nothing. I\'m starting to wonder who he is working for, it feels to me like he is way too friendly with the district people and not doing enough to help my son. I left him a message the next day and gave him a list of issues I wanted resolved, and told him if this mess is not taken care of before school starts, my son would not be there, and that the district will be forced to pay out the nose for a special placement for him as a result. I told him I am beyond frustrated with the situation, that anything that is discussed I want put in writing, and that I am not going to put up with it anymore, and that if I need to hire another consultant I already have a recommendation in my wallet from his therapist. He says he is going to schedule a meeting with the principal, and I stressed that any solutions they promise HAVE to be put in writing from now on. I\'m tired of being nice to everyone, it\'s not working, and I feel like it\'s his job to fght for my son, and he is dropping the ball. The therapist told me that it\'s very common for the district to try and move the meeting along fast to get out of there without adding anything to the IEP, when I brought this up to him, he said that is simply not true. I asked a friend who teaches in another district, and he said that it happens that way a lot, that he has been in a lot of meetings where that happens.</P> <P>Am I over reacting? I feel like I have been too patient with this whole process and all the players. I\'m worried that it would be hard on him to go to a different school next year, but I\'m also concerned about keeping him there as well.</P> <P></td> </tr> </table></td> </tr> </table></td> </tr> </table> </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P>I understand completely what you going thru. My son in Pre-k and i had to withdraw him yesterday from school. and now it seems that his PEECH teacher is complaining about everyday when i go and pick him up. All she can say is \" I think he need medication\". I went thru a tough for the first two months on school</P> <P>I\'m so scard when he get in kindergarden, I\'m thinking about changing his doctor.

'<P>If a parent takes the school district to a hearing, the parent has the Burden of Proof. That means YOU will have to PROVE that your child is not getting a Free Appropriate Public Education. Not that easy to do. Also, a Hearing Officer has to follow educational law and educational law was written SPECIFICALLY to make sure medical advise did not trump educational opinion. In fact, doctors are MEDICAL people, not EDUCATIONAL people. While your doctor might be 100% right, he is no more an expert in speech or OT than we moms are. A Hearing Officer might take a doctor\'s opinion about a dx over a teacher\'s opinion, but not a doctor\'s opinion of how much speech to give over a speech evaluator\'s. What you need to look at is how much PROGRESS the child has made since this time last year. Lack of progress = lack of FAPE and requires more and more intense intervention.</P> <P>To top this all off, if a hearing officer thinks that the parents have brought the hearing \"Frivolously,\" (and that is LIKELY if it\'s over a couple of extra sessions of speech), the PARENTS can be forced to pay the DISTRICT\'s lawyer. The new Burden of Proof rule and Parent Pay rule is thanks to our new Supreme Court. Those were not the rules until the past year or two but it\'s what we\'re living with now. </P>'
'Did you change school districts or schools within a district? This might matter.<br><br> I suspect that there are two ways to go about this.

And while they are getting their act together, get an outside evaluation to recommend placement, and invite them to the IEP meeting as well. I hate to say it, but you might want to line up a lawyer as well, although not to bring to the meeting, just to consult with before and after, since legality does not seem to be a strong point with this team.<br><br>They may be hoping that - since you have a history of outside services - if they offer you an obviously inappropriate placement you will get the hint and go to a completely private placement.

'Hi. I just wanted to introduce myself. I am the mother of an autistic <br />daughter and a special needs son - twins in Kindergarten. Several years <br />ago, I got frustrated with my ignorance on the issue of obtaing services <br />for my kids and became an unwilling expert. For the last two years, I have <br />been helping other parents learn what they need to know to obtain the <br />best services for their children. They go into meeting totally prepared <br />with me by their side and I work with them from start to finish. <br /> <br />If anyone knows anyone in the New York City/Long Island area who is in <br />need of help with EI and CPSE services/schools, please have them contact <br />me. I am also here now to answer any questions anyone from this area <br />may have on the subject. I hope I can be of help. <br /> <br />My best, <br />Estrea<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Estrea Janoson  Director  SpecialConnections  EI and CPSE Consulting and Advocacy</div>'
'Thanks Michelle <br> <br> We are in a regionalized school district and there is a autism classroom in the other town. When Ryan was diagnosed last Spring, we check it with the director of preschools and felt it really wasn\'t for him because most of the kids were pretty severe. I have no idea if they use ABA or not there. <br> <br> I spoke w/the preschool director and she is checking with the director of special education for the distrcit to see what they can do. <br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Theresa   Teaching Ryan</div>'
'<P>Brooke,</P> <P>What a nightmare. That is what the school used to convince me to drive my DS to school. That and that the 10 minute ride could last up to an hour each way, for a 4 year old asd child. </P> <P>I know some of the people here will have great ideas. I know that we made a social story for my son, I am not sure it helped, he hates school and I truly mean it, he starts to whine when you say the word to him. At school are they helping him with visual schedules? I just spoke to a Dr at our states ASD training center and he told me that it is very, very important that the teachers help my son KNOW exactly what is happening, what is expected of him and how long it will last, the part that reduced me to tears <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\">, was when he said for me to make sure that we all were assuring Pooh that there was a start and a stop to school, that I would be coming back for him and that we would be going home....He stressed the importance of me telling Pooh each day if we would or would not be going to school and the school following through, that he was to do this, this, this and this and then Mommy was coming to take him home. <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\">, it breaks my heart to think of our kids not understanding that we are coming to take them home. I cried on the phone as he was telling me that. Yep, I am one of \'those\' moms, I get very, very emotional when I think that my child, your child, any child would be in a situration where they are afraid and no one is making an effort to comfort them.

'<P>auteach,</P> <P>Sadly, there are no schools for kids on the spectrum anywhere near where we live. The nearest one is an hour drive, in another state. The nearest one actually in our state is almost two hours away! </P> <P>On a side note, after all of the problems we had getting the books, my petite 11 year old got off the bus lugging a plastic bag full of textbooks for my son. Poor girl could hardly walk with them and it was a good thing I decided to drive to the bus stop and pick her up yesterday, because there\'s no way she would have made it down the almost mile long, private drive we live on. They could have at least called and had me come in and pick the books up, unless they were just tired of seeing my face in their office! The kicker was, when I opened the bag, they were the exact books I had to fight for a month to get, because they insisted they had already been sent. Now, I have to make a trip to the school just to take them back. Not very well organized, if you ask me. Talk about a day late and a dollar short! </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>-</div>'

'<P>What any advocate you use should know is that a child MUST make \"educational progress\" each year. That includes in areas such as social skills. Getting testing and expert opinions really count. The school board, frankly, won\'t give a rat\'s patootie unless it costs them money. Any negative press re spec. is usually met with glee by the public because they see saving on spec. ed. as a benefit. Parents have DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. Follow them. But make SURE you have lots of your OWN testing (whether paid for by the school district or YOU) in place before you go that route. Hearing officers also could care less about the \"poor kid.\" What they want is written evidence to support your contentions. </P>'
'An IEP is a legal contract. Don\'t sign it unless you agree with it. The ONLY way to guarantee that your child is getting enough therapy and the right <strong>kind</strong> of therapy as well as appropriate teaching is to get it on the IEP. NOTHING that is not on the IEP is owed to your child. By signing an IEP that is inadequate, you are legally agreeing that inadequate is OK. If you are consistently getting bad IEP\'s, hire an attorney. Or at least an advocate who KNOWS the local laws. If you can\'t get something on an IEP, don\'t be surprised when your son doesn\'t have an adequate education unless you plan on picking up the slack at home, which many of us have to do.'
'<P>We have a similar program, called Step by Step (except in Norwegian), which is used in general education and focuses on empathy, impulse control and anger management. </P> <P>It was not effective for my eldest son when he was in first grade - circle time was so demanding that he couldn\'t really pay attention to what they were trying to teach during circle time.</P> <P>But now the school is going to try to use the program one-on-one with him, and I think it\'s promising. I have to be realistic. The school is familiar with the program and doesn\'t have to pay for the materials, so it\'s the closest thing to social training that I\'m going to come by.</P> <P>I hope it works out well for you.</P> <P> </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Norway Mom (mother of 2 sons who were born in 1998 and 2001.

'I just wanted to offer some information \"from the other side.\" <br /> <br />As a teacher, it is my duty to keep your child safe. I don\'t know about the <br />restraints that were used and why they were used, or the situation <br />surrounding the events. I do, however, know that for some children, a <br />restraint is the only way to keep them safe. Even with preventative <br />measures in place, for whatever reason, they have spiraled out of control. <br />After multiple FBAs and unsuccessful BIPs in place, the child still may <br />engage in behaviors that are dangerous to himself or others. Restraint <br />needs to be done by someone who is a trained professional and who is <br />able to make good judgement calls. <br /> <br />I have, in the past, worked with students who engage in aggressive <br />behaviors, to the point where I have scars up and down my arms and <br />hands because of these kids. One child in particular would engage in <br />aggressive behaviors towards us. It was so significant that we often ended <br />up in the ER with severe bite wounds to the arms. I had one on my <br />chest/stomach area. It\'s not fair to me as a teacher to have permanent <br />scarring on my body because a child was out of control. Imagine if he had <br />done this to another student in the class? Parents would definitely be <br />upset at that point. <br /> <br />In order to properly employ a restraint, you cannot restrain a child as a <br />consequence to a behavior, only as a measure to keep him/her safe. This <br />child would also engage in severe self-injurious behaviors (head hitting, <br />hand biting, scratching, eye-poking) that required physical intervention. <br /> <br />The only stories that parents EVER see on the news are those in which <br />restraints have been IMPROPERLY used (I don\'t know HOW someone could <br />restrain a child to DEATH as I have seen in the news. This means they are <br />DEFINITELY not doing what has been taught) There are techniques to <br />monitor breathing, techniques to monitor facial expressions, etc. Most <br />schools or districts have a \"10 minute rule\" or a \"15 minute rule\" in <br />which, no matter what, the child must be released at that time. If you <br />need to engage in another restraint because they are still a danger, then <br />you do it. <br /> <br />With PROPER restraint, a child would be kept in a baskethold until he/she <br />was calm enough to be released. There is what is called a \"test\" release, <br />in which you loosen your restraint to see if the child is still going to be <br />aggressive/combative/dangerous to himself/others - and if it appears as <br />though they are, you do not release. This is purely for the safety of the <br />other children, your child, and the teacher(s) involved. <br /> <br />Like I said, I don\'t know HOW or WHY a restraint was used on your child, <br />but I almost find it irresponsible to say that you would not EVER want <br />your child restrained. What if he was hurting himself so badly and nothing <br />else could be done? Wouldn\'t you want them to *safely* and <br />professionally use a technique which would keep him from being injured? <br />I don\'t know your child. Is he aggressive? Is he self-injurious? If he is <br />either, to tell the school you don\'t want them to restrain him is a huge <br />liability for them. He could seriously injure himself or others and they <br />would be liable for it, when it could clearly have been prevented. What, <br />exactly, do you want them to do with him if he has spiraled out of <br />control? As I said, they need to be using proper behavioral methods to <br />prevent this type of thing from happening, but with some SIB and <br />aggression, there is nothing that can be done to prevent it, or there are <br />things that just happen even with preventative measures, wonderful BIPs, <br />great behaviorists giving suggestions, etc. in place. I am fairly certain that <br />you wouldn\'t want your child hurt by another child whose parents won\'t <br />allow the staff to restrain him/her when he/she is out of control. <br /> <br />What exactly did they say he was doing at the time? I know on the <br />paperwork they have to document the reason for restraint. I would look <br />into the situation and determine whether or not your child needed to be <br />restrained at the time. If they say he was a danger to others, ask exactly <br />what was happening that made them determine that he was a danger to <br />others. If he was a danger to himself, same thing, ask exactly what <br />happened to cause him to be a danger to himself. I think that looking into <br />the situation further might give you a better idea of the reasoning behind <br />their restraint. IF they are following proper protocol, the ONLY reason he <br />would have been restrained (even for 8 minutes) would be to keep him or <br />others in the classroom safe. <br /> <br />I wish you good luck with this and I hope that you are able to settle the <br />issues with the school. Sounds like you\'ve had some trouble with them in <br />the past, so I wouldn\'t be surprised if they were NOT using restraints <br />properly. I do believe that you can ask to see the restraint certifications <br />for those involved with the restraint. Not sure about that though. (In TX, <br />the parents were allowed to do this, but it might have just been my <br />district? I do not know). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><div class=\'post_sig\'>-   \"We should not strive to change the child with autism to fit the learning environment; rather we need to change the learning environment to fit the learning characteristics of the child.\" (TEACCH)</div>'

I do not believe that all marriages are the same and I know that not all partners are willing to do their fair share. It wasn\'t always that way in my marriage either, believe me. I had some rather lean years as far as assistance went but we came out of that phase by keeping many possible outbursts tucked in our hearts instead of throwing them at each other ... stress can be such an enemy in relationships. I also know many of my friends without the extra stress of autism, have the same problems in their marriage relationship so it is a common issue. </P> <P>I too, feel blessed to have these beautiful children in my life and I marvel at how my NT teens have pitched in to help me during the tougher days. But I also have days when I truly hate autism too and wonder what my life and that of my family could have been ... but mostly I am grateful to wake up each day to look after all of them.</P> <P>Claire</P> <P></td> </tr> </table></td> </tr> </table></td> </tr> </table> </P> <P> </P> <P>Claire, I am not offended at all. Sometimes, the written word comes across wrong. I really just wanted to emphasize that, in my case it has nothing to do with having sped kids. I wanted children and I didn\'t say, \"Okay, this is the only kind I will accept\". Granted, I was also the type to believe, \"It could never happen to me\". Um....learned to eat THOSE words..lol</P> <P>I have tried to work this marriage. Still in it, after 20 years. I am not divorcing. But, I have to be careful about what influences my children and, unfortunately, my husband is an addict (of another type). We have done counseling, church counseling, pastors and friends talking to him..even the cops I worked with back home came over. I even took him back, both times after he walked out on us. Marriage is a two way street and we BOTH have to work at it. Unfortunately, only one is-and I am tired. My kids have to come first, for their welfare and safety.</P> <P>One thing our family doesnt do is play the disability card. We don\'t give more attention to one more than others. Maybe cuz we have 3, and I was really blessed to have an older daughter that didn\'t get a chip on her shoulder. I can\'t say I would have been as good as she has been. These kids love each other big time..we are a close family. I would love my marriage to work, but right now, all that seems to be constant is our love for each other-my kids and I. I am concentrating on that.</P> <P>you are admired and appreciated, Claire. I read all your posts and never could I see myself getting offended at anything you write.

'<P>My main question is how how how do I explain (again) to this new school that although my daughter is very high functioning, that she still has special needs and requires accommodations?</P> <P>My daughter has been in 3 different programs. All start out by testing and saying oh she is wonderful! Within a week, the phone calls to pick her up early and notes start. Then it seems they blame ME for her behaviors. The same behaviors that I always have mentioned from the beginning!! The very last program she was in, I pulled her out as I walked in and 3 adults were holding her down on the floor, totally immobile. They said she was fighting with them when she was instructed to go to timeout. </P> <P>My child has been in speech and O/t since she was 9 months old. Diagnosed PDD by the age of 2. Didn\'t speak in understandable sentences until after she was 3, pottytrained around 4 yrs old. Therapy has done wonders and now she will allow touch (hugs,etc) as before she wouldn\'t. She also does better on all testing as she has been through it sooo many times and is incredibly quick to pick up anything-she is reading some!!</P> <P>Issues that are a concern: eloping/running away, safety awareness, aggressiveness, repeating anything over and over, laughing/talking LOUDLY, not following instructions, will pick one child out and repeat whatever he does all day long. </P> <P>Most of the time, the schools have questioned if she is autistic as she is so far ahead cognitively in some things (have to keep her occupied ALL of the time so I teach her). She has made great progress except in behaviors. </P> <P>I am not a professional, only her mom. I feel that I know her best and know that a regular ed classroom of 1 teacher to 20 children in kindergarten will not work for her. Yes I understand inclusion but don\'t want my child constantly in trouble or in timeout all day long. :( I hate that!! I would rather positive reinforcements to be used! I also know that putting her into a spec ed room will not be good as she will repeat any behavior she sees. So that leaves homeschooling which I can do but I can\'t help her to socialize. I try but she gets out of control and we end up back at home.</P> <P>So what is a mom to do? How do I get the point across that she needs a parapro to prevent running and aggressiveness and even to take her to the spec ed room if she gets out of control? 1 teacher alone can\'t leave the other children and do this. Ugh I so dread it!! Any great ideas that worked with similar children? I would soo appreciate the help! </P> <P> </P>'
