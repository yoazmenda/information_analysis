Here are it\'s uses:</FONT></strong></P> <P><strong>PRESCRIBED FOR:</strong> Diphenhydramine is used for the relief of nasal and non-nasal symptoms of various allergic conditions such as seasonal allergic rhinitis. It is also used to treat patients with chronic urticaria. Although antihistamines are the preferred class of drugs in allergic rhinitis, they only reduce symptoms by 40-60%. Diphenhydramine also is used for allergic reactions involving the eyes (allergic conjunctivitis), to prevent or treat active <A href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/&#115;cript/main/art.asp?articlekey=9485\" target=\"_blank\"><FONT color=#0033cc>motion sickness</FONT></A>, and for mild cases of Parkinsonism, including drug-induced Parkinsonism. The last two uses (motion sickness and Parkinsonism) are based on the anticholinergic effects of diphenhydramine, and not its antihistamine effects. Diphenhydramine also is used as an aid for insomnia.</P> <P><strong><FONT color=#990099 size=4>I found this too!! I feel better!</FONT></strong></P> <P><B>PREGNANCY:</B> Diphenhydramine has been used extensively in pregnant women; the incidence of fetal malformations is the same as that which would be expected in women who are not taking medications. Additionally, studies in animals suggest no important effects on the fetus. Diphenhydramine, therefore, can be used in pregnancy if the physician feels that it is needed. </P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Holly_WA on July 04 2007 at 7:07pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- http://themeluginmonkeys.blogspot.com    Holly-mom to:    DH-David-Aspergers  Sarah-14y Anxiety  Rachel-13y Severe anxiety, Bipolar, ADD, LD\'s, CAPD  Jacob-9y HFA, anxiety, ADHD  Anna-7y anxiety???</div>'

'I think you\'re right to worry! Even a service dog still needs exercise, <br />training, grooming, feeding, and to have it\'s poop scooped!!! <br /> <br />The first thing to ask yourself, other than whether you\'re ready for all the <br />responsiilities that come with dog ownership, is what specific function <br />you\'re hoping the dog will fulfill with your daughter. <br /> <br />If you\'re wanting a dog to prevent your child from wandering, or find your <br />child should she wander off, you\'ll need a specially trained dog from a <br />major service dog organization. <br /> <br />If you\'re wanting a dog as a companion to your child, who will be her best <br />friend and help engage her, draw her out of herself, and give her a sense <br />of responsibility and self-esteem, then, provided your daughter actually <br /><em>likes</em> dogs, any old mutt will do! <br /> <br />We have three dogs, all rescues, and they\'re great for Donny. They\'ve <br />been good in teaching boundaries/appropriate behaviour around animals, <br />and in getting him to engage with another in a forceful, intentional, direct <br />manner. Dogs don\'t respond to \"sit\", when it\'s said from 5 feet away in a <br />sing-song voice by someone who\'s not looking at them - Donny\'s having <br />to learn to get eye contact, face the animal, stand tall, and firmly say \"sit\", <br />while using the hand signal. It\'s worth it to him, as he finds it very <br />rewarding when an animal responds to his directive. Donny also <br />practices following directions around making their food, putting it down, <br />putting a leash and collar on them, walking them, etc. <br /> <br />He absolutely LOVES our one little dog, and she\'s fantastic at cheering <br />him up when he\'s cranky - she would be considered a \"therapy dog\" I <br />think. <br /> <br />That said, I don\'t leave the dogs alone with Donny, he\'s not allowed to <br />walk them by himself. HE is too unpredictable, and dogs are only dogs <br />afterall! There\'s still a good amount of time where he\'s not appropriate <br />with them. He has a hard time understanding that they don\'t understand <br />screeching gibberish mixed with the words \"go away!\", shoving hands, <br />and nervous giggling. We\'re always talking about being nice to the dogs, <br />and if he doesn\'t want them near, either sit on a piece of furniture, or be <br />in his room (he tends to go lay on the floor by a dog, flop around, then <br />get grouchy when the dog gets excited and tries to lick him and play). <br /> <br />Also, breed does NOT matter. If you get a dog, choose a dog based on <br />what your family needs. If you\'re strapped for time already, I\'d choose a <br />sturdy, short-coated breed that can do without a ton of exercise. <br />However, know even the most low-maintenance dog is still going to need, <br />at the very least, a daily walk and two 10-15 minute training sessions per <br />day.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Donny 13 - classic autism, bipolar</div>'

'Whew! Today was the first day back at school. It was only a short day, <br />from 8:30-10:30, and Don managed to stay for half of that. First day is <br />always challenging because he\'s very keyed up (all the kids are), and it\'s <br />completely chaotic - kids haven\'t been sorted into classrooms yet, there\'s <br />no teaching or planned activities, etc. <br /> <br />Don woke up this morning, excited but nervous. He was still <br />apprehensive that we\'d be taking him to his old (bad) school, and kept <br />looking down the street at it, despite my reassuring him that he wasn\'t <br />going there, but was going to his school (some of y\'all might remember <br />he switched schools midway through last year, due to serious issues at <br />the school he was in). <br /> <br />When we arrived at school, the parking lot was a mess, there wasn\'t even <br />any parking. I had to park in the handicapped spot. We headed inside, <br />and it was very crowded and noisy. His classroom was overflowing into <br />the hallway - because classes haven\'t been sorted yet, they piled all <br />registered Gr. 4 kids (60 of them), plus their parents who\'d come with, <br />into a single classroom. We had to push through a line of people at the <br />back of the class, and ask a woman to please move, as she was sitting in <br />Donny\'s seat (he\'s got a special work area at the back of the class, as well <br />as a regular desk). About 5-10 minutes in, the teachers managed to <br />divert half the kids and parents into another room, thank goodness! <br /> <br />Don then got to sit in a desk, with a book, while the teacher talked about <br />expectations, and all the other orientation stuff, and handed out planners <br />and school supply lists. At one point, Donny put up his hand, and, when <br />the teacher called on him, said the teacher\'s name. The teacher <br />responded with, \"yes?\", and Don had completely forgotten what he was <br />going to say, so said, \"Everybody, jargonjargonjargon Transform.\" <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley36.gif\" border=\"0\"> <br />The teacher was a bit puzzled, so I just quickly inserted that Donny was <br />saying he was happy to be there with everyone <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"> <br /> <br />He did great with listening to and following instructions on a little ice <br />breaker activity (write your name on a slip of paper, toss it on the floor, <br />then pick one up - the name on your paper is who you interview). He was <br />a bit overwhelmed being interviewed, even with my and the TAs help, as <br />it meant all the kids were talking at once, and people were moving <br />around a bit in the room, but he did pretty well. It helped that the girl <br />interviewing him was a friend from last year. <br /> <br />Then, when it was his turn to interview someone, it was a bit goobered up <br />- the girl he was to interview was trying to interview another girl at the <br />same time. Don was trying to ask her the questions (with prompting), <br />but, as she was distracted, talking with the girl she was interviewing, it <br />was pretty overwhelming. He started to shut down with all the noise - it <br />was interesting, as it\'s the first time I\'ve been able to actually witness him <br />going into sensory overload. His eyes were getting glazed, and he was <br />having a hard time looking at anything, and it was obviously becoming <br />more and more difficult for him to hear. He started to look frightened - I <br />never realized before watching that what a scary experience it must be for <br />a kid to get overloaded that way. His TA and I managed to get his focus <br />long enough to ask him if he wanted a break (he did), and we got him out <br />of the class. <br /> <br />He went to his old classroom (which was empty), and drew on the board <br />for a bit, obviously trying to refocus. He then went back to his current <br />class, and was upset that it was still chaotic and noisy. He tried to run <br />out, and when I asked him to wait, he screeched once, but when I stopped <br />him and asked for words, he said (almost crying, poor guy <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"> ), \"May I <br />go on the computer please\". We had him put his book away, and went <br />down to the computer room. He was trying to wind down on that, and <br />then the computer froze... <br /> <br />He, understandably, started to meltdown a bit, kept saying, \"stupid, not <br />working!\", and started banging his fist on the table. He really wanted to <br />shut it down - it was hard for him to leave it there not working. We left <br />for a treat and then home - he was almost crying, from being <br />ovewhelmed, stressed out, and frustrated. He was convinced he\'d had a <br />bad day. <br /> <br />Now we\'re home and he\'s had a Rootbeer float from the drive thru, some <br />tortilla chips, and is watching Tree House. He\'s starting to wind down, <br />and is pretty tired. He\'s now recognizing that he did AWESOME, and Mom <br />and Dad are really proud of him.

'<P>I\'m catching up on my reading as we were out of town for a few weeks. The \"OT\" part of this thread caught my eye, as my family tree (and perhaps DH\'s) is not the greatest in terms of DDs.</P> <P>I have/had 2 brothers with downs syndrome, so yes, Tzoya, it does happen. And it is rare, as we never met another family like ours. My brothers were born in 1961 and 1964, and genetics studies were like a pipedream compared to the knowledge of today. These brothers came along AFTER my essentially NT sister and myself. In fact, my mother became pregnant 5 more times, 3 of which miscarried, one she chose to abort (VERY hard and emotional decision), and the last which resulted in my much younger \"baby\" brother. By societal standards, he is NT. Was my mom irresponsible, etc to get pregnant so many times after already having 2 downs children? No, but this was back when birth control options were not as varied as they are now (is that a good way to put it?).</P> <P>Anyway, our family found out in the early 70\'s that downs CAN be genetic and one parent can have a \"carrier gene\". I don\'t remember the specifics, just that my mother has it, as do I. None of the rest of my immediate family do, according to the geneticists at Johns Hopkins back then. I remember finding this out before I was even a teen, so my \"family plan\" was thought about long before I even wanted to kiss a boy!</P> <P>Fast forward to my 20\'s and having children myself... I have 4, the third one has autism. My last was conceived before Tony\'s evals/dx, so there was no turning back on my youngest. Having known I had the \"carrier gene\" for downs, my husband and I talked at great length with a genetics counselor, or priest, etc. about risking becoming parents. My brothers by this time were adults, and one was already dead. So we looked at having a family a lot differently than our peers. In that vein, I had amnios (sp?) with all 4 of my kids. By the time Tony was in utero, DH and I were more of the opinion that we would not abort if the test results revealed something, we would just be better prepared mentally at birth. Our thoughts on that was that yes, the amnio could reveal SOME disabilities, but not all. I don\'t think there are genetic \"markers\" yet for blindness, hearing impairment, etc. just to name a few \"lifelong\" disabilities.</P> <P>I for one totally respect Tzoya\'s point of view, as someday, in the not too distant future, my downs brother\'s care will fall on my shoulders. I would like to point out that the issue of having \"too many\" children has been a hot issue for years... disabled or not. And my personal opinion comes more from the perspective of living every day life, the financial and societal impact aside.</P> <P>For the last 2 years, I too have been a SAHM. Before that, I was fortunate enough to have my mom available for child care (particularly for Tony) and was able to work full time. For several reasons, I had to quit full-time work then and will be going back to work soon after our big move to DE in a few weeks. I truly believe we all contribute in our own way, and not being an \"individual taxpayer\" does not diminish the value of our contribution to society. There are pros and cons to THAT issue as well.</P> <P>I\'ll get off my soap box now! I really enjoy how everyone on this board feels comfortable sharing their opinions. BTW - we have also been in a 2 bedroom 1 bath home (apt no less) for the last 2 years. So again, I feel the conservatism there... count your blessings its just the 3 of you! <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley1.gif\" border=\"0\"></P> <P>Mary</P>'

He falls much more frequently with shoes than without. He also whenever he is walking just wanders around the house aimlessly not playing or anything which I hate.

'<P><EM><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=4>I am new to this whole message board thing, but running out of ways to get information. My daughter got put on Risperdal last week and had 2-3 meltdowns (2 hrs each) for the first 2 days. She just cries and screams very loudly and doesn\'t want anyone to touch her. She seemed to be better the last 3 days, but now she has been back at school for 2 days and they want me to come and get her each time she has a meltdown. I told them I can\'t keep her home the rest of school year and that I think she is doing it somewhat to be able to come home. The doctor says that this is normal and it will take a few weeks for the medicine to adjust. Anyone have advice about what the school says or on the new medicine? I am the step-mom and have only had Chelsea for 6 months now (she moved from CA) and every time I think that things are going in a positive direction I find myself dealing with another new issue.

(I know its hard to trust the people with your child but I suggest phone interviews seeing if the people would be willing to meet with you briefly at a mcDonals playland or a park and start out having respite while you are there for a few hours cleaning so you know how it goes before actually leaving them with your kids!</P> <P>TELL HER you have NO IDEA whats available and you are overwhelmed.... </P> <P>As far as your custody situation playing into getting this help for your boys Im not sure what you mean?

'<P>I don\'t want to go into too much detail but I did want to let people know to check the clinical policy bulletins about coverage options for Autism frequently. I recently noticed a change on Aetna\'s that states intervention including ABA is medically necessary for children with Autism. There is lots of other mumbo jumbo in there and I haven\'t pushed it with them yet because we have a waiver but it sounds promising. It also says that even though Aetna feels it is medically necessary most plans will not include coverage...it is covered through the behavioral health portion which apparently many plans exclude. I am thinking my particular plan includes this because Aetna is reimbursing the state for many of my son\'s therapies. </P> <P>I don\'t really want to share specifics about my employer or the health plan I have but I did want to throw it out there because a couple of years ago this clinical policy bulletin specifically said these treatments were NOT medically necessary. So moral of the story is if you have Aetna as an option check it out to see if your plan covers ABA or other therapies...</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Heather  Mom of 6yo son with mod/sev Autism and severe hemophilia.

I have high blood pressure, fibromyalgia (a pain disorder that is made worse by stress and lack of sleep), arthritis, and abdominal adhesions ( another painful condition from my c-section in 96). I basically function, I don\'t exercise, I can not really plan for spa days or to have coffee with the girls, so whatever I do have time for I make it really count. I purchased a guitar for my bday last month and it has really relaxed me so much. The only problem is with my joint problems I often have stiff hands the next day.

In the problem I posted about, I did not go into details of ds behavior with dd, situations that arise and his reactions toward her - nothing anyone could really pick up on or relate to in regard to their relationship, only because I was concerned about dd and her feelings in this post.<br><br>QUOTE\"that your DS may feel that way towards DD as he sees her basicly excell in life where DS may find it more difficult or even impossible\"QUOTE<br><br>In your rambling way (which is a trait we share) you hit the nail on the head, entirely by accident, for this particular piece of ds puzzle. It took Dr. Phd. BCBA about 8 days of data analyzing and $500 of my money to figure out because it was not a clear cut case, and not simply a matter of ordinary sibling rivalry.<br><br>WHAT WOULD WE DO WITHOUT YOU?! Ramble all you like any time any post, even when your drunk and not making any sense at all - there\'s always something in there, even if just 2 words, that makes a lightbulb go off in someones head here!<br><br>Now, \"<font style=\"font-weight: bold;\" size=\"2\">Jeeze\"</font>, for your \"problem\" (which I have seen you post about before)<br><br>QUOTE\"...work doing the job I do driving forklifts which require no education, I have a nice small home, and may live here forever, never doing better, I want a family someday but that may very well escape me... I remain where I am forever. \"QUOTE<br><br>The \"being\" part of human is the fact that you CAN have whatever tangible things it is your heart desires, IF you TRULY want it. This is not something new, or some crazy way of thinking - it works - trust me, I know. Of course, there are certain things that can never happen, but they really are few and far between. Most important in obtaining WANTS is to not sell yourself short. Set one goal at a time and run with it!!!! There is NOTIME to waste in life - get/take everything it is you want. The road may get bumpy, don\'t give up, figure a way around, there are many avenues to take. The only drawback is that you will have to sacrifice certain things to obtain the one thing that you are currently working toward. I could explain and keep rambling about how, lecturing on can and can\'t, but I\'m sure you know what I mean. The only true reality is you can only want for yourself, not for anyone else. I\'ve gotten EVERYTHING I\'ve ever wanted so far in my life and I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth. The ONLY thing I want now and am willing to give up all else for is my son to be able to \"function\" without any assistance and communicate. But because of his neuro limitations, it just doesn\'t seem to work for him. He concentrates on what he wants now. He\'s a kid, so his priorities are fun ones. He wants to keep making those jump shots, play ball on the big boys team and climb on the highest rooftops (literally). And despite what they say about his motor \"problems\" (yeah, right-idiots) he can, he does and he will because he WANTS to. <br><br>One last piece of unwanted advice \"Be careful what you wish for\"!! Boy is that ever true.<br><br>If you choose to reply to this, I would like to know what are your roadblocks. I would love to help you as you have been helping me. I\'m great at this stuff, like you are great at figuring out the ASD mind stuff.<br><br>Now, I expect a wedding invitation, christening (or brisk, whatever) invitation, a housewarming party invitation and a Conrats on your new job party invitation with in the next 10 years!

'<P> I feel your concern, when my dd went to preschool for the first time and keep in mind this was spose to be a school that is used to working with kiddos like mine which is autism. She was 3 years old never done any sort of school. I went to find out that they would put her in a chair like that because they couldnt get her to sit for circle time. I am like what do you expect. You have to work at it. Some of these teacher just dont have patients for children like ours. Its like well have them be a helper during circle time. After that we no longer having her go to that school, we had more problems with them. My dd didnt even finish her first week there.</P> <P> I was told by a good friend, follow your gut feeling!! If you honestly can say to yourself it doesnt feel right then say this is not right and I do not approve and if they comply I would do pop visits just to make sure they are doing what you want them to do.</P> <P> There are different ways to get your child to slowly learn to sit for circle time. Like giving them a book of there own when its circle time to keep them sitting. But you actually have to work at it and not just throw them in a chair that they can not get out of. I honestly think those chairs are ment for severly handycap children so they can be on the same floor level as the other children, and someone thought it would be a great thing to stick our kids in them because its easier and they dont have to be distracted by the child. Sorry I could go on with this. It just breaks my heart and I feel your concern.</P> <P> Just remember do what your gutt says.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Never give up</div>'

On our way home from group therapy, he saw a kid from his school. In fact the kid recognized him first and spoke to him and he completely ignored him and started kicking a wall. This is a kid that he always talks about. He seems to admire this kid too. </FONT></P> <P><FONT color=#9900cc size=3>I am just so beat up right now.

It gets so frustrating when he is trying to say something to me and I don\'t understand and believe you and me I kill myself to make sense of what he is saying. I dread asking him to repeat things because this becomes a knock down drag out war. He completely looses it. Going to the park is supposed to be a breath of fresh air but when we go, it is him complaining that he has no one to play with. I\'ve tried showing him how to play with the kids, standing near while he asks to play, telling him repeatedly to play, to just kicking a ball with him myself. Sometimes, he will get lucky and play with another child (rarely) but altimately, he his right by my side. He is getting to the point where he would prefer to stay in his room and watch Charlie and the Chocolate Factory all day if he could. I have to force him out to get air and excercise. </FONT></P> <P><FONT color=#9900cc size=3>This is not how I pictured my life with my son to be. I feel so cheated today by autism.

'I would definitely give them (and the doctor once you get an appt.) the WHOLE list. You should ask how many \"standard deviations\" below normal your child is in each area. Ask what the criteria is for receiving services. Schools have to obey the law when it comes to giving services. That means, a child has to be a certain amount below normal before services can be given, legally. The schools MIGHT say you should check into getting an evaluation from a medical doctor to rule out or rule in autism. You can ask the school to pay for that medical evaluation. Around here, kids who are sent to the autism experts through the school district get bumped to the top of the waiting list. Actually, a medical diagnosis is not required in order to receive services. However, for your own peace of mind and also to help cut through red tape, you should get one. The schools can give your child the educational label of autism without the medical diagnosis but many are reluctant to take that step.'
'The nighttime stimming is a hard one. My son did it too and I used to tell him to be quiet, time for sleep. But mostly I tried to ignore it because I was too tired to intervene all the time.

'My friend is autistic and was tested for deafness throughout her childhood. Her best friend even bought her a hearing test once for her birthday in adulthood, because she was very concerned about her. She tested as far above average in all areas of hearing. It wasn\'t a matter of her not hearing things, it was a matter of how she was interpreting what she heard, which parts of things she was paying attention to, and how much or how little she was reacting outwardly to what she heard.<br><br>'

'I would find the local expert in autism, hopefully a psychiatrist. I think they do a better job than neurologists because psychicatrists treat the MIND, not just the brain. And, yes, the hormones can play a HUGE part. Please try to find out what doctor in your area is the \"go-to\" autism specialist. Especially since your child is a girl, she needs a doctor who has actually treated a lot of girls on the spectrum and they are in the minority. Good luck.'

Also, someone in yr school district\'s special education department may have info on what\'s available in yr state. Do they have an autism specialist, or maybe a behaviorist? Maybe the local health department would be helpful? When Zach began school they gave me info about the waiver, and it was easy to sign up.

'DS is still hitting at his schools. He did not hit from 3.5years to 4.5years and then it bascially started up again several months ago. Mid-Nov to Dec it dwindled considerably, but now it\'s back again: hitting peers-even hitting teachers at times. Hitting is becoming for him, his primary coping mechanism-when he\'s frustrated he hits. I have a reward system set up for him when he doesn\'t hit, but this week he\'s hit in several different environments. Last week he had a good week, but this week has been pretty darn terrible. I just don\'t get it. Everyone is trying to help him not hit, but it just keeps happening. Sometimes it\'s sensory overload, sometimes he\'s annoyed with a peer, sometimes he\'s angry at a teacher-it\'s such a range of reasons that it\'s just basically his coping mechanism. Hitting gets him out of difficult social situations he\'d rather not navigate, gets him attention, gets him out of difficult sensory environments. In many ways, hitting is an effective behavior for him for getting what he needs/wants. I\'m just at a loss in terms of what else to do. I just find it so depressing. I\'m trying to help him as much as I can and I can\'t get this hitting thing to stop and am envisioning all sorts of problems down the road when he starts kindergarten and gets bigger...<br>Nowwhat<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS, 7, Autism, little DS, 5, PDD-NOS</div>'

He said, \"Drive. And work in a videogame store.\"<br>I moved on and asked if anything was hard for him and he said, \"Talking to people. I don\'t know what to say. I can hardly talk to my friends.\" (I could see he was uncomfortable as we visited at Christmastime.

As of now, I don\'t think he will have the \"normal\" goals of wife and kids. I just can\'t see it, but we\'ll see. It\'s totally up to him. Autism means he will forever be naive.

This would make him angry, but he had a new opportunity each day to try to keep the Buzz and Woody one dry. Believe it or not, it eventually evened out in terms of how many of each we used.

'<P>Autism can run in families and even if other sibs aren\'t on the spectrum, things like ADHD and dyslexia are common in families with autism. Getting full evals for both boys is important. </P> <P>An IEP is based on NEED, not diagnosis. Since a diagnosis has not changed the test results for your son (why would it?), the services don\'t necessarily have to change. That is, unless you think they are NOT addressing some issues. YOu can ask for assessments in any area of weakness you perceive is not being addressed. In particular, I\'d ask for an OT eval and ask that it include assessing for sensory integration dysfunction.</P> <P>I\'ve said a million times over the years here that a MEDICAL diagnosis for a young child with autism is not at all necessary and that the school district doesn\'t even have to consider it. What they HAVE to do is consider the child\'s actual needs. Obviously, a lot of the need STEMS from the autism. But special education law is written specifically to exclude the requirement that a medical diagnosis be present. The child just has to fit the educational label, in this case Autism. So it\'s no surprise at all that a medical dx hasn\'t changed a thing for your son.</P> <P>That said, I\'d pursue evaluations for your other son asap. The system has to address HIS needs, too, with or with a medical dx. IF he has needs. </P>'

'<font size=\"2\">Rainman, the young Aspie who was here, got a PM telling him, in essence, that not everyone here embraces AS the way HE does. This is a 20 year old Aspie who is trying to make it. It devestated him and made him feel so unwelcome and upset him so much that his parents blocked the site. You are PARENTS of these kids. Whoever wrote that should be ashamed of herself! Honestly, you parents are not as tolerant as you think you are, yet you want people to embrace your kids. This is exactly how your kids will be treated by others who don\'t understand. But YOU should understand. I\'m sure the majority of you are horrified that this happened, but he and I struck up a friendship offline (because he badly needs friends) and I was stunned that anyone here would do that. Any of you who think even being an Aspie is easy needs a reality check. And maybe he didn\'t belong here, but he deserved the same warm welcome that most people get here. Look at yourself, whoever sent that PM, and look at your poor child, and I pity your child. I\'m taking time off, and will come back later, under a different name, to help with the interventions of these kids. The fact is, my son and I have had more experience than most here. And I\'ll never mention I\'m an Aspie because apparently you\'re not supposed to. Between so many parents here not getting me, even questioning the diagnosis, and sending such a hateful letter to Rainman, I have to wonder if you kids WILL reach their potential or if they will be so stressed out that they won\'t. This doesn\'t apply to those who are as horrified as me, but anyone who sees this as \"ok\" has a serious issue about autism and, considering you have a child with it, you need to ask yourself if this is the kind of treatment you would want if you child inappropriately misunderstands what a board is for and signs up for an Aspie/Autie site and then is sent an e-mail telling him off. You are going to learn, whether you think so or not, that your kids ARE different, don\'t always get it, and that you are NOT going to have a child who will understand the little or sometimes big things that other people do, and I hope your kids are treated with more sensitivity than me and Rainman (especially him) got here. GTTO, you\'re brave to keep posting here. When I\'m back, I\'ll live somewhere else, be someone else, etc...just give good help. And I\'m not reading your responses because there are too many people here who don\'t \"get\" ASD in spite of having a child who is or teaching them. You have to be tolerant of adult ASDers too because your kids will be them one day and one of the biggest problems as an adult is being misunderstood. I wish you luck. Some of you are appallingly lacking in understanding of others who are not your own kids, yet you expect teachers, strangers, and family members who don\'t understand to treat your own child great.

'Jake was always the greatest sleeper EVER. He slept through the night at <br />3 weeks. When we moved him from a crib to a bed, he wouldn\'t stay <br />there all night long, but he would only wake up long enough to walk <br />down the hall and climb into our bed. Then, about a few months ago, he <br />would wake up around 1:00am FREAKING OUT. He screamed and <br />screamed and there was absolutely nothing we could do about it. You <br />couldn\'t talk to him, you couldn\'t touch him, he wanted all the lights off <br />and he really really wanted you to pay attention to his freaking out. It <br />could last an hour, there was no way for him to tell us what was wrong, <br />we had no idea what set him off, and there was nothing we could do to <br />stop it; we just had to wait for him to exhaust himself and then pass out <br />again. <br /> <br />Eventually we figured it out: Low blood sugar! He was hungry. He didn\'t <br />eat a good dinner and didn\'t drink his milk before bed. His hunger woke <br />him, or something woke him, and he was so ultra cranky and tired he just <br />let it all out all over the place. We figured it out because when he was <br />hungry during the day he would start to tantrum in the same way, and <br />eating something made him stop immediately.

'You have to be careful with kids and only give them what it is that they want, when they are displaying behavior you want to enforce. If you give them the car when they are screaming, you teach them that is how to get what you want.

'<P>Mysh,</P> <P>When I worked on a med/surg floor several years ago it was standard for the surgeon to come to the room and talk to the parents before the child was moved. The main thing to remember , if it\'s not in his chart or on his body, nobody will know. So, you can make some notes (bright colored post-its work well), and then ask the dr to please put these requests in his chart. Also they can put a band around his wrist that says \"autistic/non-verbal\". If we have any type of alert , allergy, or concern we write it on a red band. Lastly, doctors do take into account that a child needs to have a parent there when they wake up, so that shouldn\'t be an issue. Is this a children\'s hospital he\'s going to? They are a bit more considerate to the child. I was very nervous when my son had to be admitted and sedated for an EMG.

'Thanks again for all the suggestions- <br />So far the following approaches have not worked: <br />1. Confiscate toys that are thrown- he has so many toys and is not too <br />attached to any particular one, so he will just move on the the next toy. <br />2. Try to prevent the throwing from happening- he doesn\'t give any <br />\"warning signs\" before the act of throwing (as opposed to JulieA\'s child, <br />who scoops up his toys before throwing). He literally can seem content <br />one second and the next you will see a plastic missile flying from out of <br />nowhere (kind of like in kung fu movies, like \"House of Flying Daggers\") <br /> <br />I guess the key is to figure out which mode of communicating that <br />\"throwing is not acceptable\" will click with him.

'<P>I was wondering about this. I first thought something might be wrong when Nate was a baby. I had pre-eclampsia but also was a Navy wife so received no treatment for that. They actually messed up pretty badly. I was so swollen I couldn\'t wear shoes of any kind, feet didn\'t fit. If you touched my arm you\'d dent it, it was terrible. I showed up for my appt when I was 9 days overdue and they had mistakenly scheduled me for a day the clinic was closed. They said I\'d need to wait another 2 wks for an appt, I had waited 17 days for that one I wasn\'t waiting again. I was sent up to the \"labor deck\" to be evaluated. When I got there they told me I wasn\'t who I said I was because I was in the back being induced already. The dr had gotten the charts mixed up and thought someone else was me the day before and induced them instead. They were only 37 wks, I was almost 42. They did an ultrasound to check for cord placement once they were convinced I was who I said I was and, after I explained to the dr how to turn the machine on, they said the cord was nowhere near his neck. Unfortunately the dr was wrong, it was wrapped twice. The labor was fine until the cord began to choke him. Then they rushed me to a delivery room and a nurse jumped on a stool and literally pushed him from my body. Yes, there was meconium, but not a lot. I was in labor about 24 hrs.</P> <P>When I brought him home I sat and rocked him for hours waiting for him to go to sleep. He just laid and stared with the hugest eyes. Finally I had to get my older child a drink so I laid him in his cradle for less than 5 minutes. When I came back he was sound asleep. That became his pattern, if you wanted him to sleep you had to lay him down. He was a very calm baby, rarely cried and slept a lot. Or so I thought, as it turned out he wasn\'t sleeping. I finally decided to go in and wake him up, to not allow him to sleep for hours, and when I went in his room he was just sitting in his crib staring at the wall. He wouldn\'t even acknowledge that you had walked in the room usually. Sometimes he\'d be rocking. He didn\'t like any toys until he discovered his brother\'s matchbox cars. I don\'t think he ever would have walked if it weren\'t for matchbox cars. He\'d do anything to get his hands on one. When he\'d get one he\'d run it around and around on the coffee table in circles. He literally wore a groove in the table. Later he began to line them up and you couldn\'t touch them. Then he began being interested only in the wheels. He\'s never played with any other toy, not even the playsets for the cars. </P> <P>I thought it was funny when he finally spoke and his first word was cookie. He didn\'t say momma or dadda until much later. When he was 2 if we would buy him a pack of M &amp; M\'s while we were out he would refuse to eat them until we were home. Then he would dump them all out on the table, sort them by color and throw away the brown ones because you just don\'t eat those. In fact, all brown foods are bad, if you were wondering. Now he doesn\'t eat M &amp; M\'s either because there\'s brown inside. </P> <P>Some milestones he met, some he didn\'t. He loved his jumper, would jump in it for hours. All along the way I mentioned these things to his dr. His dr always brushed me off, told me I was complaining about having a content child. He told me I was upset because he didn\'t act needy enough and I was a person who needed to be needed. I tried not to complain after that and actually lied sometimes to the pediatrician about certain things so that the dr would stop thinking poorly of me. Maybe I wasn\'t being attentive enough, I thought. Maybe I was just missing all of the things Nate could do. What bothered me most was the blank stare that Nate often had. It\'s a mouth gaping stare that he still has and wears whenever he\'s not connecting with us. And he never ran to us for a hug, or wanted to be cuddled. I missed that with him. There were many other little things. I didn\'t realize that they all added together, I viewed them all separately. But I always knew something wasn\'t right, there was a problem somewhere. </P> <P>Nate wasn\'t diagnosed until this past year. He\'s 9 now. They rated his anxiety and it\'s in the 97th percentile along w/ paranoid schizophrenics. They say he lives in a constant anxiety attack. I really wish that someone had listened sooner but I can\'t change that. </P> <P>One other odd thing to add to this long post... We lived in Navy housing. Nate was born in the summer. Navy housing is infamous for it\'s pest control trucks. They drive around all summer long spraying pesticides so thickly you can\'t breathe outside, you go inside but the stench penetrates the house. I\'ve heard some theories that one of the catalysts to ASD could possibly be pesticide exposure. If that is true then I know where Nate got exposed. </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Tia</div>'

'<P>JM,</P> <P>I would love to speak with you offline.</P> <P>You sound like a very involved parent. Not that it mattersa, but are you a Dad or a Mom? You strike me as a Dad.</P> <P>The thing is this: As has been expressed here, autism comes in so many different shades.</P> <P>You noted to sunny, \"If your 3 year old can go up and insult somebody can he actually be considered ASD?\" (Paraphrasing).</P> <P>Well, one of the criteria that might be an aspect of an ASD is not understanding the social mores...not quite fitting in . It has been noted that sometimes (I will be using sometimes here over and over again because there is nothing static in any of this) a child living with Asperger\'s has no censor and will say anything that comes into their head. They may or may not understand that it is socially inappropriate to tell someone that their hair is a mess or their clothes smell...etc.</P> <P>Also, ASD kids become fascinated with things. Asperger\'s kids have been known to get fixated on a topic intersting to them and may go and put in the face of others because they simply assume that they will be as interested as they are! I knew a boy once who was fascinated with aquariums. No matter the topic of conversation he always brought it back around to aquariums which was pretty awkward, but...not to him...that is what he wanted to talk about and he saw no reason to sit bored with with what someone else was describing when his information was so much more interesting.</P> <P>My son is gifted though not quantifiably (we have never had him tested for such)...it is my perception, and much like you, I hope that he will be indistinguishable from NT kids by age 6 or 7 and have even been told so by his developmental pediatrician (but his testing PhD says otherwise), but I don\'t know if he will. Everyone seems to have some answer! It makes for real craziness. Maybe he will just be \"the quirky kid\" by then...I don\'t know. </P> <P>What I do know and have accepted is the fact that he will always be on the spectrum. That part does not go away it only comes in different shades. I would be very careful about having the diagnosis lifted and the services going elsewhere because if you decide you need them...you will have a tough time coming back.</P> <P>I hear the anguish and torture in your posts. I am going out on a limb hear to say that I think that you might want to ask yourself why it is so important to have the label gone. Is it for him or...for you?</P> <P>Get more evals. Get the testing done. Search this board for PDD andtess and anything else you like or ask the questions and someone will steer you towards the information.

We have a 13yos who is profoundly disabled, then we adopted our 10yos as a preemie baby - a very sick foster baby. What I meant to say about his police idea is that now that my son is getting older - his public meltdowns could result in police intervention.

A typical problem that develops at this point is that parents give in to temper tantrums. This in turn develops a \"pathologic\" situation, where instead of the parents teaching their abnormal children normal socially accepted behavior, the entire family \"learns\" the abnormal behavior from their affected children. This causes the child to lose his chance of being appropriately directed into socially accepted behavior from early on, as should be done. </FONT> <P><FONT face=\"Times New Roman, Times, serif\" size=2>As a rule, parents who change their normal behavior in order to accommodate their children\'s abnormal behavior are doing a severe disservice to their children and to themselves. The correct approach must include a firm, strict discipline to correct all their child\'s abnormal autistic behavior (see behavior modification). Typical mistakes in this regard include letting the kids run around with food because they refuse to sit by the table, allowing their children to carry an exaggerated variety of objects or toys everywhere they go in order to pacify them, letting their kids get away with holding their bottles or pacifiers, or refusal to eat certain consistencies of foods in order to keep the peace and prevent temper tantrums. </FONT> <P><FONT face=\"Times New Roman, Times, serif\" size=1><FONT size=2>In the long run, however, tantrums are unavoidable because there is a point where the parents cannot keep up with their children\'s unreasonable requirements, and if the response of the parents to the unreasonable request is not fast enough or not complete enough, the tantrum will occur. The best way to stop the tantrums right from the onset is to help the child adjust to the requirements of society. In the long and short run, it will be easier to change the child\'s behavior rather than \"change the world\" and society to adjust to the child\'s abnormal requirements</FONT>.</FONT></P>'

I wish I could help you with discipline. I can\'t, but I can give you hope. At age 4 1/2, my son broke into speech and, like many strange autistic behaviors that happen to our kids, his bad behavior stopped as though it had never been there. He never raged again. He never hit or bit again. He was fairly compliant. Today he is almost 13 and the most mellow kid on the face of the earth, almost a couch potato. People can\'t believe he was once diagnosed with ADHD. Our kids change SO MUCH. I\'m not sure how much traditional discipline helps autistic kids since often their motivation for behavior is so different than \"typicals.\" Oh, yeah. My son also nevr slept and, if we didn\'t watch him, could leave the house at 3am and run naked into the street. We got permission from Social Services (he was a foster child then) to use a hook to lock him in his room at night for his own safety as long as we had a monitor in his room so he could wake us up.

I do not think at all that one can say that \"most\" will not grow into a satisfying, independent life. Look at how this board has changed even in the past year. We have had major skirmishes b/c what some of the newer parents are describing as problems just do not even sound like they\'re in the same ballpark as others. Frankly, some of the kids who are described here sound like they have issues, but are not debilitated, by any means. Some sound to me like they are barely on the Spectrum. What I see on this board, often, is that a lot of parents freak out over a recent dx because they are envisioning old school autism, when, in fact, their kid <EM>is</EM> most likely going to develop into a pretty average person. </P> <P>IMHO, of course.</P> <P>Not only has the diagnosis broadened considerably, but the treatments and therapies have come a very long way, as well, even in the past decade.

'My son\'s speech therapist would agree with you Auttie. My son is 3 and has very bad eye contact. His speech therapist was working on this with him. But after a lot more research on chilren with Autism and eye contact, decided to back off. Would we rather him carry on a conversation appropriately or look us in the eyes? Right now, he can\'t do both. Also, she said that a lot of children with Autism have better peripheral vision and they are actually seeing you better if they look at you peripherally. So, we have backed off. He seem to like this better. One day we might work on it more, but not now. We would rather see progression on his language than his eye contact, right now.'

He runs around the room with a zoned out look and what seems as though he\'s trying to get everything in. I can tell myself he is overstimulated.

'We have 2 books for our older dd, to help explain autism & all. <br />She\'s known all along about her sister\'s special health needs & <br />developmental delays, but \'autism\' is a fairly new term here. We keep her <br />in the loop, to the extent that she will comprehend. Anyway, I had taped <br />the Nick News special on Autism from April, after my sister recommended <br />it. So, dd & I watched it. I wanted her to see how kids on the spectrum <br />are so varied, how some kids can even play hockey or piano, and also to <br />see all the other siblings who are dealing with the same issues she is. <br /> <br /><font size=\"2\">Five minutes into it, they were discussing symptoms & hand- <br />flapping. She immediately says: \"Well, of course \'E\' has autism. I don\'t <br />know why they didn\'t just tell us earlier. She does all those hand things <br />too!\" I laughed because it was just so matter of fact to her. With a tone <br />of \"duh people!\" to it.

'Hi, although I am no physician, it does sound like he could have an autism spectrum disorder. His repeating of words, twisting hands, licking objects, are all typical of autistic behaviors. My son does all of these too. He was diagnosed at 32 months, and has been in an autistic classroom setting since then. At the beginning (3 years old), he never noticed other children, avoided eye contact, but was never \"totally\" withdrawn. He was always tolerant of a hug from us, and loved to be tickled by his siblings, but that was about the extent of his interaction.<br><br>Now at 5 years old, he does show interest in children, although the way he shows interest in not typical of other 5,4, or 3 year olds. He will approach them and push them, not to be mean, just to try and interact. He will approach a total stranger on line in a grocery store, and plant his face in their BUTT<img src=\"smileys/smiley5.gif\" border=\"0\">!!! If someone in an office says hi to him, he\'ll walk up, and touch them in the chest, or squeal in their face while smiling. So, he\'s not withdrawn either, just inappropriate.<br><br>It\'s not that autistic kids don\'t interact with others, it\'s just the WAY that they do that makes it unusual. Most 5 year olds would simply approach another child and say \"hi, I\'m so and so, what\'s your name\", or \"do you want to play\", etc.<br><br>Still, the interest my son has in other children now, is still an improvement from a year or two ago when he was totally oblivious to them.<br><br>Please take your son to a neurologist, or a developmental pediatrician. He can still benefit from therapeutic intervention like ABA, speech, and OT to address his falling out of chair and licking things.<br><br>Good luck!! Keep us posted<br>'

'<FONT size=2>Well, this was in the works for some time, and it was tied in to my not wanting to lose my disability (I have a lot of trouble keeping jobs and still have two young kids). I don\'t think I\'d have sought out a diagnosis otherwise. I\'m 53 and just would have figured I\'m an Aspie and so be it. But Disability requires a diagnosis. I already have Bipolar, but that isn\'t enough to keep me from being able to hold sometimes very easy jobs. I had four meetings (two hours each) with an ASD Specialist in my area. He listened to my life <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley36.gif\" border=\"0\">, spoke to me, then get me a gazillion tests!!! Based on my work history, early history (I didn\'t let my mother hold me as an infant and kicked anyone who tried to touch me), spoke early and like a \'little professor (still do), wrote words at age two, and my mother thought I was a genuis until I got to school and really struggled both academically (math) and socially was totally ostracized, etc., blah, blah, you know the drill. I\'ve always had trouble with social cues, \"getting\" social norms, and life has been a big ball of confusion for me. Worse, my parents thought I was just being \"lazy\" when I lost jobs and threw me out of the house. They refused to help me. I got married twice because I knew I couldn\'t live independently. After my divorce, I tried to make it on my own, but I couldn\'t so I married my current hub, and, fortunately, it has worked out. My first marriage was terrible, but I stuck it out for seventeen years because I knew it would be hard for me and kids if I divorced him, and, boy, was I right!!!! I did divorce him, and almost lost our house! I never felt comfortable around most people. Small talk is impossible for me. I\'m comfy only around the three people or so who \"get\" me, so that I dont\' have to put on an act that I\'m just like everyone else. I\'m not, and it\'s quite stressful for me to try (and often fail anyways). I sometimes get people mad and don\'t understand what I did, so if that happens here, please tell me. There are also times I get confrontational on purpose because I so strongly disagree with the person and feel that the response is damaging to ASDers (which I have a double special interest in). And I\'ll tell you that, if you ask...lol. Anyone who thinks it\'s easy to have Aspergers is fooling herself...it\'s been very hard. Of course, I didn\'t have any interventions and no family help. I think the latter was my biggest problem. I really did need to live with somebody, and was thrown out instead. I still delegate household finances and scheduling to hub. If hub passes before me, I\'ll have to move to be close to grown kids. I still have trouble even sweeping the floor right...lol. I don\'t know how to hold a broom right and am very clumsy.

Most of it is immediate, but occassionally it will be delayed, and she will repeat a sentence she heard earlier a couple of times, as if she is trying it out. The boys echo too, I\'m not sure yet if its normal echoing in a speech delayed child since their speech is probably at about a 30 month level or a sign of their autism.

Vaccinations were not on a schedule- he recieved only 1 shot per visit, 4 hib total (2,4,6 and 12m) , at 15 and 18m he had the polio vax and 24m he had a DT only. He has never had MMR. As a baby he had no sensory issues, and actually ate much more than my husband would ever consider. <br><br>Somewhere between 18 and 24m something changed- he became more fearful of things- loud moises, riding on the tractor with my dad- the vacumn cleaner- stuff that had never bothered him. He also became more picky about food. He stopped trying to put words together. We couldnt ever decide if he was loosing words- it seemed like he was acquiring new words, just not using the old ones as much- so there were only abt 12-15 words he would use at a time, although he knew hundreds, and could name flash cards all day if you could get his interest. <br><br>Fast forward 2 yrs. We didnt go the therapy route. Well I take that back. When he was abt 2.5 we decided to try private pay speech therapy- it was a very expensive disaster. 3 months and i swear he was more oppositional than when we put him in therapy because of the adverserial situation she created with him. So last school yr we decided to approach the public school system. Because he was about to turn 4 they kinda kept putting us off. We got shuffled around a bit, and in that time someone flipped a switch and the speech started pouring out. We have a hard time getting him to be quiet now- and it gets better every day- we went from couple word phrases and LOTS of single words to real sentences. He still is terrible at using pronouns, and cant ask a question, but hey, we have come a looong way in a matter of months. <br><br>So anyway, he finally starts the school program back in March after a failed attempt at a \"regular\" preschool. He would bolt out of the class. Wasn\'t working for the teacher. Anyway, after a week in the \"autism\" class, the teacher tells me that she is having none of the trouble that he was, and that she doesnt thin he is autistic. That if we pushed hard we MIGHT could get a PDD_NOS label, and that later in life he may end up with an Aspergers label, but that in all of her experience she hasn\'t ever seen a autie that was anything like Liam. She also thinks we should wait to have a label until we need it for some reason. <br><br>Realizing now that I haven\'t described my child at all. He is now 4.5. He is umm brilliant- he can watch you do anything mechanical once and copy it. He can navigate a computer better than many adults I know. Oh, forgot to mention that the speech started when we realized that he could read. He are suprised daily at how MUCH he can read- his therapist had the speech picture cards flipped over to where the word side was up, and he went through 3-4 categoies reading abt 85-90 percent of them before he lost interest. Knows, colors, shapes, numbers, anything academic. He seems to have no real sensory issues other than he is extremely picky like his daddy- loves bread and cream cheese and oatmeal and other things are hit or miss. He loves to talk, is very friendly with adults- other kids he doesnt seem to have a clue how to play with. He iIS interested in playing, just doesnt understand how to engage them. Everything is big with Liam- he is a big loud boy who is always in motion. He runs, he jumps he pulls you along. He is overexhuberant. He has a hard time sitting, unless it is a task he is interested in. He is very self driven. <br><br>OK, so this year, they are trying to combine the class that he was in for 3m last yr 9the autism class) w typical peers in a headstart program. There are 15 kids total (10NT, 5 with some sort of spectrum issue). 1 teacher, 2 aides, and then a head teacher w ASD experience who bounces back and forth between the 2 classes. He attends from 830-1230, M-F. Well of course liam has ended up in the class that isnt working very well. He also isnt getting the therapy in the IEP. The other thing is, the IEP was written back when he would cooperate for no testing at all. It was also written before we even started in this class- when he was still trying to attend a typical preschool. Has been amended a few times but it is a mess basically. <br><br>What I am trying to do is go in with a bit of ammo. Typically they do \"group\" speech therapy for autistic kids becuase it is language therapy and not speech per se. Liam has some articulation issues though, as well as language. I would say his languiage delay is abt a yr or a smidge more at this point. Liams IEP says he gets 2 30 min sessions of speech per week, and since school started, they have only been doing 1 group session. They are still trying to get their act together, but hasnt quite happened yet. Anyway, I think he needs at least 1 private session per week- liam learns much better one on one. I think at the very least the group needs to be done w typical peers present. Right now he is only recieving 2x a MONTH of OT- I think this needs to change too. <br><br>I guess I want your experiences- what type of therapy are you recieving from the school system? How can I push this?? They are calling the class in general therapy, and although I think his teacher is great, I am not sure I would agree. How can we come up with a number for the amount of speech? How about OT?<br><br>Sorry so long- I will come back and edit for typos when I get the kids to bed- oh I almost forgot- I also have a 16m old boy :)<br>thanks so much if you got this far!<br>heather<br><br><br>'

'I chose to use the word \"perform\" purposely. He looked as though he knew his cue and did what was expected of him. He \"acted\" NT. When he didn\'t realize the camera was on him, his relaxed face looked very spaced out to me, much more like the autistic kids I know. Fred\'s mother noticed the same thing, apparently, because she used the phrase \"well trained.\" The fact is, if this little boy can function as well as it appears he can, then whether or not he has \"recovered\" is not the issue. Clearly, functioning well is the goal. It\'s just that I don\'t believe he\'s recovered at all. He just regained lost skills and developed far better skills than most kids do. I applaud the parents\' efforts as well as their clear statement that this sort of \"recovery\" doesn\'t happen to all, even if parents, professionals and kids put their ALL into it. Their son got the proper interventions and was lucky that his brain reacted so positively to them. He is the rare, rare exception, tho I have seen EVERY child who got ABA interventions improve a great deal. I\'ve also seen kids who got TEACHH interventions and other types of therapy improve as well. I even know a teenager who got just the most modest interventions improve. Probably all our kids would improve without ANY interventions. However, they would improve far, far less than if they get appropriate interventions early enough. I think the \"recovered\" boy is an excellent example of what a minority of kids can be like. One never knows WHO will be in that minority, so it pays for all of us to try. The video of that boy shows him at a far more involved level in preschool than my son ever was and now he\'s far more advanced than my son. To some extent, it\'s the luck of the draw. But we don\'t know WHICH ones will have brains that change enough to advance to a nearly NT functioning. So we all must try, IMHO.'

'We have been getting a lot of question from the school district about our auties and our future plans for them. Currently we homeschool our oldest two children and they are aware of that and keep questioning me about our intentions. Then we have 5 little ones also that are not school age yet.

Three of these children (the adopted ones) were formerly foster children and they are related to me. <br> The therapists at the school (ST for 60 min, OT &amp; PT, 30 min each, plus 1 on 1 preschool- we are a rural area and have no preschool class so they are doing 1 on 1 up at the public school an hour a week) all spend time doing exactly what we are doing at home already.

'<P>Hey,</P> <P>I\'m the mother to a very special 27 month old little girl, as yet undiagnosed. She was a 34 week preemie so we didn\'t think a lot of her delays until getting closer to her 2nd birthday - we thought she was just a little behind, nothing too special. After getting her assessed, it turns out she was a lot further behind than we thought. </P> <P>At 27 months, she only says a handful of words and very rarely in any sort of context. She\'s lost a lot of speech too (used to randomly say mum, dad, no but doesn\'t anymore). The only 3 words she actually uses properly are \'ta\' for when she takes something she wants, \'meow\' for when she sees a cat, and \'bye\' when she\'s going somewhere or wanting to leave somewhere. She has a few random words (five, fish, and \'good girl\' as one word are the big ones right now) that she uses with no context at all. Just randomly while playing or in attempted conversation. She babbles a lot and makes a full range of sounds, but no actual communication. She doesn\'t recognise words (though she knows no, bye, meow, ta, and her name) and doesn\'t point to anything - whether it\'s something she wants, or something she\'s asked to point to. Nothing sinks in.</P> <P>Lately she\'s taken to hurting herself whenever she\'s frustrated with something - banging her head into hard objects enough to leave lumps and bruises, scratching, biting, hitting, pinching. I have no idea where it\'s come from or what I should do about it. Her speech therapist - the only therapist she has right now - didn\'t have any suggestions. I\'m worried about pandering to it and reinforcing the behaviour, but if I don\'t stop it she hurts herself quite badly. She cries when she does, but she doesn\'t usually respond to pain at all (things like when she falls over).</P> <P>She\'s only just started walking, too.</P> <P>She\'s a very social creature though - she doesn\'t interact much with other kids at playgrounds and things, but she likes to watch them. She doesn\'t like it when they touch her and she doesn\'t like to touch them. Her eye contact used to be shocking, but it\'s gotten a lot better recently. </P> <P>We\'re waiting to see a developmental ped but it could be months, we\'re on a waiting list. I\'m not coping. I\'m on other forums - mostly parenting ones - and it\'s so hard seeing other children who were born the same month she was due doing things I can\'t even vaguely imagine. They\'re running around, talking in sentences, toilet training. She falls over every few steps, doesn\'t even call me \'Mum\', and has no awareness of when she needs a change, let alone when she\'s going to soil herself. I don\'t feel like I have anyone to talk to at all. </P> <P>I\'m constantly guilty about wanting a \'normal\' child. Every day I wake up and just hope she\'s normal. I would kill for typical 2 year old tantrums and yelling matches in the supermarket. I love her to bits, but some days it\'s just so hard. I left my husband in August and he doesn\'t bother to see or call her, and has no idea what it\'s like to parent her. As she gets more independent, the problems are getting harder and harder and I just have no one to talk to. </P> <P> </P> <P>Please tell me someone else has been in the same situation?</P>'

But giving a diagnosis at 9 months could be a little misunderstood. Sometimes you can go to four different doctors and get four different answers.

I don\'t know, I guess time will just tell. But mother know when something is not right. And when you have been trained to look for things that are not normal, I think it is a lot easier to say what you think your child might be developing. It will be interesting to see how this is tested. I think that there are some 9 month olds that you could maybe say, yes, they are showing signs, but then others it could be hard to tell, because the spectrum is so big.</FONT></SPAN></P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Private tutor.

'<P>Hopefully, the entire \"back-off\" from Abilify was supervised by the doctor. 3 weeks is the time it takes for Abilify to leave the system and 3 weeks is the amount if time it will take for the Abilify to be fully in place again. A gag reflex is sensory. Some kids are able to swallow pills better if the pills is in a spoonful of pudding. The pudding protects the throat from the feeling of the pill. For years my son took Risperdal (similar med) CRUSHED. You\'re not supposed to do this, but it was better than taking him off due to his inability to properly swallow it. Fortunately, when he got older he was better able to swallow pills.</P> <P>One of the things that bothers me A LOT about the medication issue is that many people are SO against medication that it makes those of us who have chosen to use medication feel very, very guilty. No one makes the parent of a diabetic feel guilty about giving them insulin by needle. Many of our kids have issues of not having the proper chemistry in their brains and medication can resolve this. Meds are not \"the last resort\" for \"bad boys.\" I realize that in this case, it was your son who chose to not take his meds. This is common. The adults in his life need to work with him so he understands how important his medications are. Like the BP example. In this day and age, we are BLESSED to have the option of safe, effective medications. And I am one who believes giving a child medication that helps him so much is a GOOD thing and should never be perceived as some sort of failure on the part of the parent or the child. Meds are just one more tool - not morally better or worse than any other (like ABA or BIPs or OT). JMHO.</P>'
'Retarded is not an epithet. It means a child\'s tested IQ score is 60 or below. Retardation as measured by IQ scores is present in many, many autistic kids, though retardation is not required for any of the ASD diagnoses. The only ASD kids who appear to be exempt from the possibility of having a low IQ are Asperger\'s kids. I have never heard of an Aspie with an IQ below 70. However, there are many autistic kids and PDD-NOS kids who DO have IQ scores in the retarded range. The word retarded simply means slow. I did not and do not mean it any any pejorative way.'

(I\'m no longer an ECEoftheFuture, and instead an ECE of now!)<br><br>I think any of the jobs you listed would be great and fulfilling. I am currently in a Occupational Therapy program and I love it. The program itself is not focused on working with children, it\'s only one element, but with my degree in early childhood education, i\'m sure working with children is where I will end up. <br><br>A little information on the OT thing. You now need to have a masters level degree in order to be an OT (this is true in Canada, where I live, and i\'m pretty sure it\'s true for the states as well, but you\'d have to double check) so it would take some time if you need to finish college first. That being said it is a fantastic career path, with about a million possible practice areas. There is also a shortage of OT\'s right now, and with the growing trend of hiring OT\"s to working with children who have Autism, the field is just exploding. Basically there is a lot of job opportunities and security in the field so I would highly recommend it. <br><br>If you have any more questions, let me know. <br><br>Natalie<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Natalie- Hoping to help your children someday (considering a possible career in OT?

'Gee, my PDD-NOS son has ALWAYS wanted to make friends. In fact, one of his obsessions is friends and their families and their pets and their names and their middle names and their phone numbers, etc. He LOVES people. He just doesn\'t really know how to deal with them. Or, more accurately, he deals with them in a very immature way. Still, he\'s ALWAYS loved people. BTW, all through his preschool years, he just had \"autistic tendencies\" and that was enough to get him whatever services he needed. By 5, I wanted an official diagnosis because I thought it might eventually help in school. I took him to a well-known autism psychiatrist around here. He did not feel comfortable giving him the diagnosis yet. We were getting all the services, so I didn\'t worry. I went back the next year, when DS was 6, and he got the official diagnosis then.

'You know that with autism there is often a deficit in the executive thinking skills. So she may have trouble with understanding how to do it. Things that may help are pictures on the toy bins to show what goes in to each toy bin, a picture of the shelf or closet showing everything put away, step by step instructions (in pictures is awesome), and removing almost all the toys except for 2 or 3 bins of toys so there isn\'t so much to be overwhelmed by. You could have a \"toy library\" somewhere in the house and trade out bins of toys. I hope that is helpful.'
'My son has PDD and Tourette\'s. He was prescribed Clonodine which helped calm him down but didn\'t address the tics. My son was then prescribed Risperdal which helped with his aggression and his tics until he hit puberty. At around 11 his tics became a major issue. They sound like a cough. We couldn\'t even go out in public without someone commenting that sick children should stay home. Our son\'s psychiatrist referred us to a neurologist who prescribed Topamax, a seizure medication that is also used to treat migranes. The tics are sometimes there but I would say that we have seen a 90% improvement.'

'<P>You have to determine the function of the hitting in order to determine how to react. There\'s a way to do this, but it requires cold observation. Emotions can\'t be involved. Of course, it\'s hard to keep from being emotional when one of your children is being hurt by the other. However, the reason for the hitting will determine how to handle the hitting, so it\'s worth trying to do. The ABC method is this. YOu write down what happened right before the hitting and write down what happened right after the hitting. (Antecedent, Behavior, Consquence). So if right before the hitting you were on the phone and right after the hitting you got off to reprimand your child, chances are your child wanted your attention and then you gave it to him after he hit. Of course, you can\'t stay on the phone while he\'s hitting, but if you find out that he\'s hitting to get attention, you can arrange things so the baby is way out of his way when you are not able to give him that attention. However, if you say, \"pick up your toy\" and then he hits the baby and then you put him in his room, his hitting was likely a way to escape the chore he didn\'t want to do - picking up his toys. While he\'s banished, he can\'t pick up his toys. You get the idea. </P> <P>Most ASD kids have very sensitive hearing and cannot stand a loud voice. When your son hits, you can grab him, look him straight in the face and yell \"no hitting\" at him. Then, put him in a chair or his room for a minute per year of age. Or for a count to 10 or 50 if that\'s too long. The idea is to impose some kind of banishment. Of course, you have to take the reason for the hitting into consideration when you apply a punishment as consequence, but you may be able to avoid some hitting by figuring out the reason for the hitting in the first place and setting up the situation so as to avoid hitting if at all possible.</P> <P>If your son is able to understand earning a reward, you can give him points or stars or stickers or checks for catching him doing good things. If he gets a certain number of those things, he can earn a treat. As punishment, it\'s possible to take one away. Not everyone agrees with the taking-a-star-away tactic, but it is very powerful and hitting is dangerous, so using it as punishment for hitting may be the time to do something like that. When my son was little, I learned this from his kindergarten teacher and used it at home: Divide an index card into 20 spaces. Each time the child does something good (even something little that\'s good), draw a star in the space. When he\'s earned 20 stars, he gets to choose something from the \"treasure box.\" You can accumulate a box full of small treats like stickers or tiny toys or small snacks. You can regulate how quickly your child earns the stars. On difficult days you may have to have him earn his stars more frequently so as to help him focus on the good things he\'s doing. Hitting could be the one thing he loses a star for. Write them in pencil so they can be erased, but rarely erase one. Just for hitting sounds about right. One of the great side-effects of this system is that it forces us parents to LOOK for good behavior. In the beginning, your child should probably be getting 20 stars in one day. You can increase the distance between stars as rewards as he gets used to the system. </P>'

'<P>We took him off all milk product from about birth to 1 1/2 years old. Then slowly introduced cheese items, ice cream and various other things. He seemed to do okay with these items so far. He does seem to be bothered by soy if it is a mix of soy and milk in processed foods. </P> <P> My other big issue is that I cannot get him to eat chewable vitamins so I try to dissolve them in his juice. It is going along with his pickiness of what he will eat. He will not try anything. He is a chicken nugget, juice, rice, bread kid. All the things that make him constipated of course. The doc that is not listening keeps telling me to get him to eat fruit and things that start with \"P\" to make him poop. I tried to explain that if he would try them then that would be great. The doc is not getting the severity of the problem. We will have food on our walls if it is out of Jax\'s taste range. The doc told me to make him a meal and if he does not eat that meal wrap it up and bring it back out again the next meal and so on. He said sooner or later he will get hungry and eat it. I tried it for like 2 - 3 days. Then I thought this is rediculous. I don\'t even like to eat left overs like that when they have been reheated and reheated. Of course Jax would rather starve himself than eat it. I just opted to try to let Jax pick things out shopping even if he just liked the packaging. Then I began to allow him to look in the fridge and pull things out open them and taste them if he wanted. Generally this begins a mess and he generally does not like much. I think he does it more to play and have sensory time with the food textures. My hopes are he will find something one day and totally surprise me. We did get something new in the diet this past week. I began to make bacon on toast sandwiches. Normally he will not touch breakfast but he is really tough to deal with when he is hungry. So I cut them up all pretty and he actually is eating those. Granted we have to have the same thing each morning for breakfast but oh well. It is eating and it is one meal he did not do before. To me that is progress!</P> <P>Anyways, I could go on and on. It is so nice to finally find a place where I can talk with people that understand what is going on. I just kept thinking I must be a crappy parent. </P> <P>Thanks a ton,</P> <P>Suns</P>'

'<P>I spent the weekend with my autisic nephew. My sister in law is a social worker and works with all kinds of special children. He is 10 and we have been aware since he was a baby. We spend lots of weekend togeather . He is concidered high functioning and attends a regular school. </P> <P>I had an incidance where I took him the car by myself. It was a busy parking lot so i had him enter from the drivers side rather than the passenger side as he usually does. It freaked him out. Now as a father of two normal kids, my reaction is not to give in to tantrums. He did get in the car and started to melt down. I was able to distract him and things leveled out. </P> <P>The problem that I am stuck with and brought me here is that I do not understand the diability. We have been lead to believe that though extra work and socialization, he will get better. We should treat him like every other kid. In reality he will never be like other kids, and I could be more help if I were tought to understand him more. I belive there is a certian denial that keeps her from educating those close by. I think that throgh sites like this I can learn to modifie my parenting skills to give her a break. I am one of the only adults in thier very large family that will inter act with him. I think everyone else is afraid, due to the lack of guidance. </P> <P>Is this common among parents of autistic children? How have succsesful families handled it? Do i approch her and explain my feelings, or would this add to her situation. Do I get involved to educate others in the family? It seems like she is going it alone, (her husband is very god with him, but will always defer to her). any insite would be helpfull. </P>'

'<P>I was watching a show on Feral Children on TLC (they are going to show again tonight) and I was wondering if ds\'s problems may be my fault. I\'ve had a nagging feeling for quite sometime that this is my fault. Maybe the fact that his language is not properly developing is my fault? I\'m a quiet person by nature and maybe I just haven\'t talked enough to him as he\'s grown. I\'m very affectionate, and maybe that\'s why he has no problem giving and receiving hugs and kisses and I even caught him voluntarily patting his little sister on the head and then giving her a kiss. Maybe his intense fascination with numbers and letters is my fault? When we color together MY DRAWINGS and such lack imagination, and maybe I focused to much on numbers and letters? I thought I was doing it (numbers and letters) because he enjoyed it. He can read over a hundred words that I know of and if he hasn\'t seen a word before he tries to sound it out. His brain shouldn\'t be ready to do this right? When he was younger I did try to read to him but he would just take the book from me and run off. I used to sit on the floor and try to play with toys with him and maybe it was ME who lacked imaginitive play and he just didn\'t learn from me. I am an only child who didn\'t have any one to play with and my social skills are lacking (I\'m very shy) so maybe my problems are rubbing off on him. Thank goodness he\'s started school and is getting a ton of interaction from other children and his teachers because obviously I just don\'t cut it. Even now, <EM>that I know</EM> that I have to talk about everything I do and label everything as I walk through the house and changing diapers, etc, so that ds can learn language, it takes everything I have just to do that because it feels so unnatural. </P> <P>Maybe I\'m just one of those \"cold\" mothers that screw up their kids? That theory has been disproved, right? Even if this is my fault, I didn\'t do it intentionally. </P> <P>I\'m not saying that all autistic kids are the fault of their mothers so please don\'t think that....I\'m just talking about MINE because of the way I am. But... kids with drug addict mothers usually learn language well, but maybe that\'s because they are running with a pack of other neglected kids and they just nuture each other. My son only has me (dh just watches tv when he comes home from work). Ds watches a lot of videos because I use them as a babysitter while I shower and do dishes because I know he will be safe if he\'s stuck to the tv. </P> <P>Does anyone else ever feel this way?</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mommy to Noah (4 - autism) and Sarah (2)</div>'
'We took our son to the feeding clinic at a local children\'s hospital for an evaluation when he was 2 1/2. The appointment took several hours- he was assessed by a pediatrician, psychologist, speech therapist, occupational therapist, nutritionist. They mostly asked us questions but they also observed us feeding him his favorite snacks and later they offer him some other foods to see how he would react. They in no way tried to force him to eat. In our case, we decided not to continue with ongoing treatment because they felt that he was getting adequate nutrition even though his diet was very limited and they did not think there were any medical issues that needed to be addressed (reflux, swallowing problems, etc). They knew that we were working on many other things (speech, coping skills, sensory regulation) and understood that we were maxed out. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- -Amber, mom to Elijah (age 5, ASD and epilepsy)</div>'

I sometimes think she doesnt inwardly regress-it just kind of stays dormant. Then, when she progresses outwardly again-it\'s like wildfire. She regresses both behaviorally and cognitively, but then comes back, twofold.</P> <P>Colin never regressed.

'<P>Not that I am recommending this, but I have heard of some parents doing things that they know will set their child off before the eval. Again, I\'m not sure I\'d want to do that - I was fortunate (I guess) that my son was in a rotten mood the day of his eval. He too, has really good days where I think that he is just totally NT. But the last month or so has been a wake-up call and I don\'t think I\'ll think that again - horrible meltdowns and out-of-control stuff that I have never seen before. It has to do with him starting ECSE and so far he doesn\'t like it. He didn\'t like his mainstream pre-school last year when he started either and now he simply LOVES it this year. So, we are waiting to give it a chance and monitoring him closely. He didn\'t have these kind of meltdowns last year so we are working with a psychologist and they are slowly but surely getting better.</P> <P>Anyway, like others have said a GOOD evaluator will look at the whole picture. Our dev ped looked at all his school evaluations - which were done over the course of the month in school, in an office and at our house. Plus, he looked at what my son was able to do in the office. He definitely saw some behaviors and gave us a PDD-NOS diagnosis. Most docs wouldn\'t have, he said, because my son just doesn\'t fit into any one slot. He doesn\'t meet all the criteria for either HFA or Asperger\'s and he is somewhere in between, but on the mild end. However, our doc said that when you get early intervention, the child has much more of a chance for progress. So, he gave the diagnosis - hurray for at least one doc! </P> <P>I would also videotape behaviors that you want the ped to see - we did that and I think that that helped make our case as well. I would also check to make sure that you won\'t be denied insurance coverage if you DO get a diagnosis. If insurance won\'t cover you, you need to make sure that you can qualify for state help or something like Medicaid. There are some insurance companies who will flat out deny any coverage for kids with autism. Horrible, I know - but it does happen. You can fight it after, but you might want to look into it before you get a diagnosis so that you are prepared ahead of time. </P> <P>Hope this helps!</P>'

'<P>I think someday we will find out it is not so much a line from severe on one end to high functioning on the other, but more of a big area chart, and that kids can not easily be fit into \"Autism\" or \"Aspergers\" or whatever else.

One Dr (a specialist in LD and ASD) said my son did not have Aspergers, but would call it PDDNOS, another (psychiatrist) uses the terms interchangeably.</P> <P>My son did have severe, pervasive developmental delays, which is not typical of Aspergers, yet at the same time posseses many/most Aspergers/Autistic behaviors and characteristics, but mildly. He continues to have difficulty educationally and easily qualifies for Spec ed - his IQ is pretty high, his performance not so good. He is less severe than Autism, but more delayed than Aspergers. </P> <P>I honestly believe that they are only beginning to find out everything about this disorder and that someday the current categories will be gone and replaced with more appropriate ones. Right now there is not one for my son, he is somewhere across categories. And PDDNOS is not widely known about by the public or teachers, our school does not even recognize it as legit.

'<P>My son has been in the psychiatric ER and they did NOTHING. We took him there a couple of summers ago by ambulance. We were at a small lake we are members of and, for some reason totally unknown to me to this day, he started to get very, very violent with me. He pulled me by my hair to the ground repeatedly. He was 13 at the time and about my same size. But the rage made him VERY strong. I was shaking with fear. I got my friends to call my DH and, eventually, the police. We just needed some extra strong hands to handle our son if necessary. Since I was far too shaken to drive him anywhere (what if he jumped me while I was driving? Or even if he went in the car with DH, he could jump HIM to, and neither one of us could stop him). It was the weekend, so we couldn\'t contact DS\'s psychiatrist. We decided to take him to the hospital via ambulance. Well, DH and I sat in our cold bathing suits for 2 hours there. The ambulance people had been SO nice to DS, he was happy as a clam when he got to ER. He sat in an isolation room where they observed him. Then they called us in to talk. They said they saw no problem at all but that based on our description of what happened, DS needed more meds. They wouldn\'t give him more meds since he ws stable at that point and just told us to call his psychiatrist\'s office to get an emergency appt. Of course, we couldn\'t do that until Monday. DS was fine the rest of the weekend until we could get into the doctor and get a raise in medication. As far as I\'m concerned, psychiatric ER is a waste unless it\'s used for your safety. Actually, there IS a Crisis Team here and they will take him to their Crisis House overnight or for a few days. But on the weekends, especially in the summer when routines are out the window, their crisis house is often full - and it was full that day at the lake. However, DS has gone there once during the day and once for an overnight. He HATES going there. There\'s nothing wrong with the place - it\'s a suburban house with TV and counselors and plenty to eat - but he KNOWS he\'s been banished. Since that overnight stay, all I have to do is mention the place and DS uses every bit of his own strength to get himself under control. I HATE to do that and only do if I sense danger (which is very rare now), but I would not hestitate to call them again. </P> <P>It sounds to me as though your son needs to be seen by a good psychiatrist who is familiar with ASD. ASD kids react differently to all sorts of medications. He may need an increase in what he\'s taking now, another med or a combination of meds. Perhaps this particular incident was caused by unavoidable stress, but he has been having lots of bad incidents lately. He needs to be seen by a doctor.</P>'

'<P>It does get easier. At least it did for me. I remember when my son was 3-4 years old and everything was a struggle and a fight. Simple acts like getting dressed were not simple acts at our house - it always involved a chase and a struggle.

'I would talk to the special ed teacher and the occupational therapist. They need to be able to help you with this. It\'s not enough for them to sit back and say you\'ll get services as long as your son shows up-they\'ve got to help you get him through the door if that is the initial problem. Don\'t feel back about telling them about this. If they know anything about autism, they will have dealt with this before. I know how excrutiating it is for you-and it is also embarassing-I had to go to urgent care once with both boys and while the doctor was examining me, they were completely trashing the room and being loud. DH was on his way to help, but since it was a sudden thing around rush hour, it took him awhile. The crazy thing was that all the medical staff just looked like deer in headlights and expected me to take control when I was the patient in pain! So they were screaming and I was trying to get them to do things, but I couldn\'t pick them up. Oh, it was just terrible. Just try to reassure him at preschool when you drop him off (i.e. peel him off of you kicking and screaming) and then leave. Make sure the teachers are there prepared for him to bolt. It\'s going to be painful the first few times, but I\'m optimistic that things will get better for him and for you. Hang in there. <br />Nowwhat'

'<P>Hi I\'m Christina. I have a son who was diagnosed by an OT as having SPD, FTT &amp; an unspecified nuerological disorder. She initially said she felt like he did not have autism, but since spending time with him, she thinks we should NOT rule out mild autism. I\'m unsure what to do.</P> <P>I have talked about this in a previous post, but he is VERY social and is meeting all of his developmental milestones, in fact, he is excelling in many areas. He is very good at communicating and the OT agrees with me on that and says he is very lucky to be able to communicate his needs so well to me. (He\'s just a chatter box and has excellent speech.) He has a lot of OCD like behaviors and lines up all of his toys, but he also plays with them. He plays pretend with his siblings and enjoys socializing. He does have a big need for order and is upset if things are not going his way. The OT thinks that as he gets older (he\'s currently just about to turn 3, next week) we will start to see more social problems because currently I don\'t see social problems with him. She thinks that as he gets into school that his rigid ways will be tested and he will have a hard time with the other kids \'messing up\' his things. </P> <P>Did anyone else feel like their child\'s social issues got worse as they got older? People are telling me that they do not see any autistic qualities in him. And I even have one person almost mad at me for considering it, which is not what I need. I feel really lost and unsupported. He just doesn\'t fit that mold of autism, but he\'s also got something going and maybe it\'s just the SPD, but I don\'t know. All I know is that my extended family thinks there is absolutely not a single thing going on with him and they are not supporting me at all, with my search for answers. He is so much better ouside of the home, than when at home. He,also, plays fine at other friend\'s homes, but does not like them to come to his home. He says it\'s \'scary because they will move his toys\'. </P> <P>Anyway, I\'m just trying to get answers for my little guy. Did anyone notice decline in their kid\'s behaviors with vaccinations? I have noticed significant differences after each set of shots and it has been really upsetting. I know my doc doesn\'t agree with me. I wont vaccinate again, ever. I feel like my little guy\'s body just can\'t handle it. I regret vaccinating him. </P>'

This syndrome acts so much like ADS,PDD and the like that you have to look into it and rule it out. These kids DO improve as they get older. Not 100% dont get me wrong but as the yrs. have passed I NEVER thought Id see my child where he is today.

'<P>OK, I\'m not angry today, just frustrated. I took my son to his regualr dentist on July 1. They took Xrays (that took about 30 min since he didn\'t like the thing in his mouth and kept taking it out) of his broken tooth and told me that he should have a root canal since the cavity in the broken tooth is so close to the nerve. This dentist wants to spare my son the pain of waking up in the middle of the night with a toothache (I\'ve had my share of those, not fun). So since he will eventually need a rootcanal she believes it\'s better to do it now rather than when he\'s in pain. I\'ve been going to this dentist for years. She has never pushed unnecessary dental work, she has always done the \"least\" amount of work as possible. </P> <P>Anyway she refers me to a practice where they were going to take Xrays and perform the rootcanal. Problem was they couldn\'t get good Xrays. I\'m watching the dentist peek in to see if the hygentists are done or not. He really seemed like he was on a tight schedule. After 30 minutes and three hygentist the dentist comes in and says, \"We tried, I think he needs to be sedated laughing gas won\'t be enough since he can\'t get through Xrays. He probably doesn\'t need a root canal since it doesn\'t hurt. Here\'s a phone number of someone who sedates, good luck...that will be $125.\" They billed my insurance as a consultation, I have to pay my copay of $25 which I\'m a little annoyed at because it wasn\'t a consulatation as they billed my insurance. IT was a failed attempt at a root canal. They didn\'t get a set of Xrays and discuss my options. They told me they couldn\'t help me. I would have argued with them if my son wasn\'t with me. He was already very anxious and coughing/clearing his throat from his Tourette\'s. If I complain to my insurance then I just have to pay the $125 since I already signed all the papers stating I would pay for whatever the insurance doesn\'t cover.</P> <P>My biggest concern is who is going to treat him? I called the number that he gave me and they don\'t do rootcanals on permanent teeth. My dentist is away and I\'ll explain everything when she gets back but for now we\'re in limbo. <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley18.gif\" border=\"0\"></P> <P>Has anyone had any similar dental issues??? </P>'

I was nervous about the line that Collin would have a breakdown from all the noise.

Anyways it was a really good thing though because there was only two families in front of us and none behind us because the line was closed. Towards the front of the line Collin started stimming pretty bad running in circles, making noises, ect ect. At one point he even pulled his pants all the way down <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley5.gif\" border=\"0\">, and uh yea plenty of ppl saw that. <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley36.gif\" border=\"0\"> But he was actually excited about seeing santa, I dont think he quite understood who he was or what was going on but still lol.

There is someone in a booth actually talking to the children as \"chester\" well we walked up to see chester and there was a younger man maybe a older teen standing there talking to chester. I knew from first sight he probably had some form of Autism. I thought oh cool lol. So Collin was really excited about chester and was trying to talk to him/her but chester couldnt understand him lol. So I was trying to get my daughter to talk to chester (she is my loud kid by the way) and she was \"acting\" shy. So chester says to her \"im not that scary am I\" and the man looks at Novaly and says there is no reason to be scared or shy. And then looks at chester and says \"chester sometimes being shy is a good thing\" He was really involved with getting the kids to talk to chester and I really enjoyed him. Then I looked over and a mom with her son went to talk to chester and after under a minute of standing there I could just see it in her face she was watching the man and immediatly yanked her son away saying \"common we need to go\" (the boy didnt even get to talk to chester) Ugh I hate ppl<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley7.gif\" border=\"0\">.

A special needs child is one who will have unusual behaviour no matter what you do. That child needs to be protected from the lack of understanding of kids.<br><br>In Ontario, family law states that if poor parenting is the reason behind a child committing criminal acts- like say harrassment, Child Protection has the authority to take away that child and place them with a foster family. And such denunciations can be made anonymously.<br><br>You might want to look up what your local jurisdiction says. I suspect that it might be a similar situation in your area. You might want to casually mention that to the parents of said bullies. They might need to know that. I\'m sure they wouldn\'t want the trouble of dealing with a child protection worker and the possible expense of hiring a lawyer to get their kids back.<br><br>I don\'t understand parents who are not embarrassed when they are told their kids are engaging in bullying behaviour. I don\'t get it. I know parents can\'t be everywhere, but a failure to act on that seems to be a failure of basic parenting skills.<br><br><br>ETA: That could be over the top depending on the situation.

'Many people from way out here in Eastern Suffolk commute into the City by train. I used to commute there 3x/wk when my son was little. It\'s about 2 hours each way, but you get to sleep on the train or do bills or just read and relax. Since Eastern Suffolk is further from the City than Great Neck or Oyster Bay (BTW - Oyster Bay is a pain to commute from because there are fewer trains that go that far north), the housing here is cheaper. You might be able to get a 1500 sq ft. house for about $300,000, with property taxes (this includes school taxes and garbage pick up) for around 5 or 6 K. That\'s a small 3 bed, 1.5 bath house without a garage on less than a quarter acre. At least there ARE houses now for around 300K or a bit less. Last year there weren\'t. If your husband works near Penn Sta., the commute will be a cinch. Consider the commuting time and difficulty before you buy. Nowhere within 2 hours\' commute of Midtown is cheaper than Eastern Suffolk. Not Westchester or NJ or upstate NY. The prices only start to go down once you\'re either not near a train station (Orange County, upstate, for example) or you\'re outside of the 2 hour limit (you\'d have to go up past Poughkeepsie, north, to find that). The commutes are expensive, but your X already knows that I guess. The good news is that the spec. ed. services can be excellent if you find out your rights and insist on them.'

'<P>Niki,</P> <P>From what I\'ve seen, most kids around here are off training wheels by end of kindergarten. My kids both point out (to my horror) when other kids still have training wheels. They aren\'t intentionally cruel, they just ask \"why does so-and-so still have training wheels?\" I definitely think it is something that kids will notice, and the older he gets, the more he will be teased. That sucks, but it\'s reality. </P> <P>I posted this a while ago buried in another thread, but I figured it might be a good idea to put it out there again. I know many ASD kids have trouble learning to ride a <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN>, and tis the season for biking (at least here in the USA). Since we did this with the boys last summer, we\'ve passed on this technique to many friends who have all had the same success.</P> <P>My dh read a book on biking with kids and there was a chapter on teaching your child to ride a <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN>. It was a different approach than I had ever seen and I must admit I was a bit skeptical. At the end of last summer dh took training wheels off the <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN>s and had both boys riding two wheelers like pros within 1 - 2 hours. No falls. It was amazing. (Note that C does not have any gross motor issues, his skills in that area are on par with his NT twin.)</P> <P>I\'ll try and summarize the technique.</P> <P>1. Get your own <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN> out and lower the seat so that both of your feet are flat on the ground when your butt is in the seat. Then take the training wheels off of the childs <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN> and lower the seat as low as it will go.</P> <P>2. Show the child how to sit on the seat and pick both feet up off the ground and try to balance. Count out loud how many seconds the child balances with no feet on the ground. Make a game of it. Demonstrate how turning the handebar can help balance. Once the child can balance with both feet off of the ground for 5 seconds, move on to step 3. (You are ignoring pedals throughout this entire step. Feet should be in the air.)</P> <P>3. Show the child how to glide forward on the <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN> by taking \"<SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>giant</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>steps</SPAN></SPAN>.\" This is basically gliding the <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN> forward, butt in seat, by taking <SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>giant</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>steps</SPAN></SPAN> with alternating feet. This is why it is important to start with child\'s seat at lowest level. If seat is too high it is impossible to do this step. Once child is comfortable moving up and down the driveway like this, move on to step 4.</P> <P>4. Have the child take 3 - 4 <SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>giant</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>steps</SPAN></SPAN> to get going, and then have the child pick their feet off the ground like they did in step 2 and glide with feet in the air. Count out loud how many seconds the child glide without their feet on the ground. Make a game of it. (Note, we are still ignoring pedals, feet should be in the air.) Once the child can glide for 8 - 10 seconds without putting a foot on the ground, go on to step 5.</P> <P>5. Have the child take 3 - 4 <SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>giant</SPAN></SPAN> <SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>steps</SPAN></SPAN> to get going, and have them pick their feet up like in step 4 and then tell them to start to pedal! Once they get good at pedaling, start raising the seat up a bit to a normal height.</P> <P>The key to this approach is to get the child comfortable balancing on a <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN> before teaching the child to pedal. The old \"run, push and let go\" technique requires the child to learn to balance and pedal simulaneously and typically results in many falls, which can scare a child and make them not want to try again.</P> <P>I know that tackling the <SPAN =highlight>bike</SPAN> issue is a big challenge for those with kids who have gross motor issues. It may take a long time to get through the above <SPAN =\"highlight\"><SPAN =highlight>steps</SPAN></SPAN>. However I think this approach is really good for ASD kids because it breaks the complex task into simpler skills and then builds on them. It also greatly reduces the risk of falling/injury. </P> <P>If anyone has questions on this or wants to discuss further, please PM me and I can give you my phone number and you can talk to dh. He\'s the resident expert in our home and can probably explain much better than me! I think this is a GREAT process for ASD kids because it breaks it down into simpler steps/skills that can be worked on - much better than the push-run-release-fall method!</P> <P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Kristy  Mom to 10 year old twin boys (1 PDD-NOS, 1 ADHD)</div>'

'As a parent with twins who had speech delays, I can tell you my experience. My dd (with autism), started out with what I called \'purposeful babble\'. It sounded like sentences were being formed but little made sense. At about three, can single words and counting. At four came short sentences. At five things more pragmatic and purposeful speech. She also became more fluent at this age. Today, she has an excellent vocabulary, pronunciation, pragmatic speech. You would not know that she ever had a delay. <br><br>As a parent you can have hope! Do not believe any chapter is closed for your child yet. Progress can take place in a matter of days or years. Be willing for now to set aside the milestone playbook. There were so many things my dd could not do at age three that she can today (go to school, eat in a restaurant, have a meaningful conversation, travel across country on a plane, the list goes on). <br><br>I encourage you to keep doing the best you can, watch for growth with receptive language (very important) and give him alternative opportunities for communication. For example, when my dd used to get upset and have meltdowns, I taught her to draw pictures of her emotions, and she learned to use that as an outlet until she could express herself better with words. Read to him a lot; I used to read a lot of Dr. Seuss, it seemed to put language in a pattern that she was receptive to.

'We\'re still struggling with the same thing you are, but I can try to offer a few tips on things that worked for us. We try to go to places where there won\'t be much waiting. If possible you can call ahead of time to order, and reserve a table. If they say they don\'t take reservations maybe they\'d make an exception if you told them your situation. We also try to go eat on off hrs, like at 4 pm intstead of 6 pm. That way if things get out of hand it doesn\'t feel like we\'re disrupting the whole resaurant. I try to take a snack with me too, that way they can eat while they\'re waiting. Usually, one of the boys needs to go outside with me or my dh to walk around. We end up having to take turns eating.

She played beside other kids, not as much with them, which I couldn\'t see. Even when the doc diagnosed her, we used meds to help with some symptoms, but I didn\'t see the full picture. I wasn\'t even sure I believed it. No one told me about an IEP, no one told me about a behavior plan, no one told me about social skills, or the waiver, or any services that were available.

'<P>Fred,</P> <P>He is a Immuniologist and on the DAN board of doctors. He came highly recommended by the parents in our city. I knew if I was to put my poor child through any diet, or biomedical protocol I had to have proof she needed them. This doctor also has a son with autism-adult now that still remains GFCf all the time and claims he is foggy when he gets something GFCF. He took vials of blood and stool &amp;urine (did these at home:P). Insurance paid for most..I think 70% and we paid out of pocket for the rest. This immunologist was the most compassionate and caring, calm doctor I have ever known.. he let us (me &amp; husband) talk out all our fears and anxieties for over an hour and he totally listened! He gave us advice on ABA and gave me a folder with chunks of information on books to read, parents groups, online support and which health food stores carry the GFCF diet and supplements. He was the only doctor willing to help us with positive information and actually had many things we could do with her at home. When the labs came back on Sarah it was almost a book! Many things were off in her compared to normal levels. I would have to dig it up now but it came from Great Plains Laboratory..they have a website listing all the things they check for. I didn\'t want to be one of those moms that did the whole 9 yards without scientific evidence:) This doctor has helped many parents here. He was truely interesting in helping Sarah and so sweet with her trying to engage her. When it came time to collect blood..he did it himself with his nurse-this was a rare event for me to see a doctor collect blood on a screaming child! He was so calm. He always encourages us to visit for free to see her progress. I never felt he was scamming us...he was very thorough in explaining all the components that are different in most of our kids-mainly gut issues and food issues. He respected our wishes when we declined to do B12 shots and secretin. With all things that DAN docs do.. the problems is that some kids respond amazingly and some not at all. My friends daughter started speaking long sentences like crazy from taking ambrotose... but the diet didn\'t do much..she still has gut issues and stays away from milk products or she will tell you \"mommy my tummy hurts!\" everytime she gets milk type foods in her. After a year on diet with Sarah she got a cookie by accident and we freaked she would regress but she didn\'t and a few more wheat/milk products over a weeks time and we noticed nothing. I learned that some kids gut actually heals and that is why she wasn\'t showing any behaviors or regression. She still at times can have milk and get spacey. I try to limit it..especially when she craves it all the time. I hope you can find a good doctor..ask other parents around you that use one...they will tell you which are in it for money and those that really care. Good luck!</P> <P>BLessings,</P> <P>Shelley</P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by ShelleyR on February 12 2007 at 5:33pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>-      Sarah~8 yrs. old 7/27/00 Pdd/hyperlexia  Stephanie~17(nt)</div>'

The purpose of this 3-year naturalistic study (March 1999-April 2002) is to describe the clinical outcome of a consecutive sample of preschool children with PDD treated with risperidone monotherapy. METHOD: The sample consisted of 45 boys and 8 girls aged 3.6 to 6.6 years (mean +/- SD age = 4.6 +/- 0.7 years) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder or PDD, not otherwise specified. Outcome measures included the Children\'s Psychiatric Rating Scale (CPRS), Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale (CGI-I), Children\'s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS), and a checklist for risperidone side effects. RESULTS: Patients received risperidone for a period ranging from 1 to 32 months (7.9 +/- 6.8 months). Twenty-five patients (47.2%) continued to receive risperidone after the study was completed, while 28 (52.8%) discontinued due to side effects (22.6% [N = 12]), parents\' choice (18.9% [N = 10]), lack of efficacy (5.7% [N = 3]), and decision of the treating psychiatrist (5.7% [N = 3]). The optimal dose was 0.55 +/- 0.2 mg/ day. Significant improvement at the last observation was found in CPRS (p &lt; .0001) and CGAS (p &lt; .0001) scores. On the basis of both an improvement of 25% in CPRS score and a score of 1 or 2 on the CGI-I, 46.8% (N = 22) of subjects were considered responders. Behavioral disorders and affect dysregulation were more sensitive to treatment than was interpersonal functioning. Responders received higher doses of medication for a longer period and had a greater weight gain than did nonresponders. Increased prolactin levels without clinical signs (65% [24 of 37]) and increased appetite (15% [8 of 531) were the most frequent side effects. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that low-dose risperidone may positively affect the clinical outcome in young children with PDD not only in the short-term, but also in the long-term period.<BR><BR>PMID: 14628979 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=3></FONT> </P> <P><FONT size=3></FONT> </P> <P><FONT size=3>SORRY-I THINK I AM EXCITED!</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=3>KATE</FONT></P> <P> </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- 7 y.o.

'<P>Like Amber said, it does differ from child to child, however there are things you can do to encourage receptive language. PECS and eventually social stories comes to mind as in encouraging language development. There is a book called More than Words. I think it costs around $50 on Amazon and it tells you the different stages in language/ social communication developmnet. In order for the child to get to the receptive language, he must accomplished other obstacles in language development. The book offers great tips and methods in encouraging communication b/w you and the child. I know there are other books out there, but this book was very helpful to me and was recommended to us by various professionals. </P> <P>I also want to add that my daughter is very receptive to music. We used that as our basic tool to get her to learn words/ phrases and to eventually communicate. We sung everything - Clean up song, potty song, bathtime song, throwing stuff in trash song, stop (while she is running away in the mall) song, feed the duck song, grocery shopping song, paying the cashier song, being gentle to her little brother song, etc. I can say that our singing voices improved over the last year...I have reached notes that I never thought I could sing<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley36.gif\" border=\"0\"></P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by little byrd on August 11 2005 at 5:17am</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>-    Jenni</div>'

One of the things I thought would be scary but was actually fun.. I took my kids to an art museum on one of the family days. They had lots of activities geared for kids and my kids had an amazing time. My dd also likes the Dole Pineapple maze (it makes her feel like she is in the Amazing Race); however, I am not sure if the draw is the maze or the pineapple icecream afterwards. We have also done some hiking and some botanical gardens. I find that my dd is very open now to new experiences..my son on the otherhand<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley7.gif\" border=\"0\">.'

'Katherine, sounds like you found an ideal specialist. Thanks for offering so much info. I hope your son is doing well in the program. Pam, now you can see why we are thoroughly confused! After 3 psychologists, 1 ped. neurologist, 1 devel pediatrician we are still confused. We do have another appt with a neuropsychologist who\'s speciality is to determine misdiagnosed kids - kids who are erroneously labeled OCD, Bipolar, ADHD, or Aspergers. She is the author of the book I spoke of that states lack of empathy is what distinguishes the Aspergers kids, at least on the sociability aspect. But now that you say your own son is quite sympathetic, I feel like whereever I search for answers, I hit a dead end. I am scared that time might run out for early intervention but I\'m trying to look everywhere for that truly qualified PDD expert. I have a friend whose son was pretty antisocial and had OCD, and she took him for a PDD eval at NIH when they were doing a study. They told her her son didn\'t have PDD because he engaged the doctor in play. This was precisely what I was told brings a child out of the spectrum too. Yet the author Nadia Webb wrote in her book that an Aspergers child can engage someone in play or conversation ad nauseum if it\'s a topic of HIS choice. Once the topic changes to something not necessarily of his interest, he refuses to maintain the social reciprocity/conversation. Or if the child is a little older, once they sense that the other person isn\'t at all interested in their obsession, they change the topic or respond accordingly, and Aspergers kids can\'t tell this. My gosh, there is so much to this area and I\'m getting the picture that lots of clinicians don\'t know this area well either.'
'<FONT size=1>Parent_Nos, you have no idea how most autistics feel. I chat with lots of them and they aren\'t as upset about being autistic as how hard others try to make them change. You can\'t, and, as your child grows, I think you will see that it\'s NOT a tragedy-merely a difference. It may be YOUR tradegy (hopes, dreams, etc), but not the person\'s. Of course, the child will be less happy if those he/she loves are trying to force her to do something that is foreign to her. That would be as stressful as typical folks trying very hard all the time to understand and to be autistic. We\'d have to monitor our every move all the time and basically go through life\'s motions without understanding what we were doing-or understanding it, but not relating to it.

'I change my mind about this everyday, but most days, this is the behavior I wish I could make go away in our son. He scripts for only a few minutes most of the time, and it\'s often in context (Thomas scripts when playing with trains, Once Upon a Potty Scripts when sitting on the potty, etc.). But when it\'s out of context and he\'s \"unreachable\" it\'s just sad. Also, he tends to greet new people with a barrage of echolalia. Very embarrassing!<br> <br> We start speech therapy next week and this is certainly one of the first things I\'ll be talking to them about. We\'ll let you know of any techniques we learn over time. We\'re desperately hoping he can turn his echolalia into real language, but it does seem like a stim for him, so only time will tell.<br> <br> We used to try to interact with the echolalia, but that rarely works unless we\'re simply filling in holes in the script. Lately, we\'ve been SERIOUSLY rewarding \"good\" speech and ignoring the stuff we don\'t like or saying \"that makes me uncomfortable\" when he gets loud or manic about the scripting.

'Hi my son is 3 1/2. He gets minimal therapy right now. He too, is a very picky eater. Only 5 or 6 things. He has pretty severe language delays and most other \"typical\" issues as well as some more severe physical issues. He is progressing. Learning words, learning to communicate with me. Engaging others. It\'s been something new almost every day for the past few months. If he had been on a special diet or taken lots of supplements or had tons of therapy, I would have to guess what to attribute the progress to. He might be progressing quicker with more, but he is happy, I am happy. I don\'t feel the need to add in tons of other things in our life right now. It is such a personal decision as there is no \"sure thing\". All kids will react different to different interventions. If your Dr. thinks he has food allergy problems, that is a whole different ball game, in my opinion, and has to be treated as any medical condition. Anyway, do what you think is best for your child. As far as I know there is no magic out there. No, you are not a bad mother. You are, as we all are, learning, asking questions, seeking out new things to help our kids.

Those caveats help explain why the stat, while alarming, doesn\'t support related claims by some advocates: that autism cases have been mushrooming with \"epidemic speed,\" and that more than one million Americans have autism. <BR><BR>First, the stat comes from figures published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on a review of several studies that came up with estimates. But the CDC was careful to point out that the studies produced a wide range of results. Indeed, the headline-grabbing number focuses on the worst-case scenario: The CDC said the number of children with autism was somewhere between one in 500 and one in 166. <BR><BR>Second, the numbers take into account a relatively modern definition of autism that includes a full range of disorders. <strong>The changing definition of autism has played a major role in influencing statistics. <BR></strong><BR>The cause of autism isn\'t completely understood; a combination of genetic and environmental factors is believed to play a part, according to the CDC. Autism can usually be diagnosed before the age of three, according to the National Institute of Health. Different from mental retardation, autistic disorders (as they are now defined) are characterized by impairment in communication and other social interaction. Mental retardation, characterized in part by a low intelligence-test score, can coincide with autism, but some people with autism have above-average IQs. <BR><BR>Those with \"high-functioning autism\" or with Asperger\'s Disorder - distinguished by less-severe symptoms that may not become apparent until later in life - are likely to have an easier time of adapting to mainstream society, and therefore their conditions can be more difficult to diagnose. Other people with more severe cases of autism may require special education throughout school years and may have difficulty living independently as adults. <BR><BR>The broad definition used to arrive at the one-in-166 figure, which includes milder forms like Asperger\'s syndrome, was published by the American Psychiatric Association in 1994 in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, known as the DSM-IV - the primary handbook for diagnosing mental disorders. <BR><BR>Eric Fombonne, an autism expert at Montreal\'s McGill University, told me that while about a dozen studies around the world have found autism prevalence rates that would be in line with the one-in-166 estimate, that same research found that the majority of those people had a mild form of the condition. <BR><BR>The high profile of the one-in-166 number has been driven by increased public-awareness campaigns about autism from the government and advocacy groups. In 2004, the CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups issued an alert (Autism A.L.A.R.M.) to doctors citing the 1-in-166 stat and advising on how to screen for cases. Since then, the CDC has reaffirmed the number in an online fact sheet (where it cited the broad range of estimates) and in a May report in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report - the latter was based on parents\' self-reporting of their doctors\' diagnoses. Meanwhile, an even more recent U.K. study published over the summer in the Lancet found a rate of children with autism of between one in 110 and one in 70. <BR><BR>The CDC has increased research spending on autism by 80% since 2002, to $15.1 million this year. (Autism groups say the government is still spending too little on research and support for parents and adults with autism.) <BR><BR>A nonprofit autism-advocacy group called Autism Speaks put the one-in-166 stat front and center in a media campaign distributed by the nonprofit Ad Council. The organization has grown quickly since launching last year, and is distributing $15 million in research funds this year, spokeswoman Susan Arons told me. \"We\'re using what is a very well-known, well-accepted number,\" she said. \"We don\'t want to be alarmists; we want to be accurate.\" <BR><BR>The nonprofit Autism Society of America, one of the oldest and largest autism groups, has seen its budget grow steadily in recent years, to about $20 million this year, President Lee Grossman told me. He attributed the increased donations to greater public awareness. <BR><BR>\"The one in 166 has been the biggest boon to awareness we\'ve had,\" said Marguerite Colston, director of communications for the Autism Society. \"Those kinds of numbers stop people in their tracks, as they should.\" <BR><BR>More Numbers <BR><BR>Equally galvanizing but more questionable are claims by some advocates, including the Autism Society, that autism prevalence has grown rapidly. An Autism Society Web page said autism is \"the fastest-growing developmental disability,\" and said the number of people with autism increased 172% in the 1990s while population rose 13%. <BR><BR>Trend figures for autism are difficult to pin down. Most of the scientific studies looking at the size of the autistic population have been completed relatively recently, and don\'t have historical comparisons, a point made in a 2001 paper by Dr. Fombonne questioning the existence of an autism epidemic. <BR><BR>Some groups (including the Autism Society) publish trend figures based on data collected from the Department of Education, which compiles counts of students with various disabilities as part of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. But changes in the way data are classified and handled have made that database an unreliable source for determining trends. <BR><BR>Until 1993, autism was lumped into other categories, such as mental retardation or emotional disturbance. Even after schools were asked to report autism separately, they labored initially under a narrower definition that preceded the DSM-IV. It took schools years to report more fully and catch more cases, Alexa Posny, director of special education programs at the Department of Education, told me. That made comparisons with figures before 2000 difficult. \"We\'re better at diagnosing and catching the students much earlier\" now, Ms. Posny said. <BR><BR>There has been a doubling since 2000 in the number of students aged six to 21 that schools identified as having autism, to 166,000 in 2004 from 80,000 in 2000. (Again, these figures use a broad definition of autism.) Several experts I spoke with told me they believed the increase has more to do with better record keeping and diagnosis than an increase in the number of autistic children. <BR><BR>Steven Goodman, associate professor of oncology, pediatrics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Schools of Medicine and Public Health, told me in an email, \"There have been a number of excellent papers that concluded that the definitions of autism are wholly to blame for the alleged increase in incidence; others have concluded they are partly to blame, and that some component of the increase is real. What is almost certainly not true is that this rate represents a 10- or 20- or whatever-fold increase in autism rates since the 1980s, which many quite vocal activist folks have claimed and vigorously promoted.\" <BR><BR>Ms. Colston agreed that some of the growth the Autism Society cites can be attributed to improved diagnostics and reporting. \"Diagnostics have improved so much,\" she said. But she added that other evidence, including reports from her group\'s members and from overtaxed state agencies, suggests a very real increase in incidence. \"That\'s what we believe, and what we see,\" Ms. Colston said. <BR><BR>The national media has also, at times, promoted the concept of an autism epidemic. Responding to some of these claims, Morton Ann Gernsbacher, professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin, co-authored a paper last year in Current Directions in Psychological Science titled, \"Three Reasons Not to Believe in an Autism Epidemic.\" One of her reasons stemmed from a close examination of data from California used to show a 273% increase from 1987 to 1998. Prof. Gernsbacher showed how broader diagnostic criteria \"will result in a dramatic increase in diagnosed cases.\" For example, among a sample of students diagnosed with autism before the broader DSM-IV definition was published in 1994, 61% were identified as having intellectual impairments. But only 27% of a more recent group of children categorized as autistic had such impairments. <BR><BR>As for the Department of Education data, the paper pointed out that other reporting categories showed huge growth immediately after they were introduced, as schools got on firm footing with new definitions. The number of students reported as having traumatic brain injuries soared more than 50-fold in the decade after it was introduced as its own category in 1991. Counts for children with \"developmental delay,\" meanwhile, rose more than seven-fold in the three years after that category was introduced in 1997. <BR><BR>Counting Everyone <BR><BR>The Autism Society also states that one to 1.5 million Americans have autism, a number derived by applying the CDC range of prevalence among children to an estimate of the general U.S. population of 300 million (and then applying some major rounding). Other advocacy groups cite a prevalence of 1.7 million, which based on the most recent decennial census\'s estimate of 280 million Americans. <BR><BR>But the available studies are all based on children. \"We really do not have a sense of how many adults would have been diagnosed with current-day criteria when those adults were children,\" the University of Wisconsin\'s Prof. Gernsbacher said. <BR><BR>Ms. Colston said of the Autism Society\'s estimate for total U.S. population: \"It\'s not a hard, fast, scientific number.\" She added that generally, there is a need for more study - and funding - for adult autism. \"It\'s the area of awareness that really needs to take off, and that includes statistics, as there aren\'t enough statistics on it,\" she said. <BR><BR>The bottom line: Stripped of spin and taken in context, the one-in-166 estimate does appear to be sound, if overly simplified. <BR><BR>Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp, a medical epidemiologist with the CDC in Atlanta, said autism studies can be particularly complex - hence the CDC\'s reported range. But she understands the desire to reduce the research into a convenient number. \"The general public, they want one number. All this information, across studies, areas, populations, they want to distill into one number,\" she said. \"My response is: It depends upon the methods used. There\'s not just one number out there.\" <BR><BR></P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Barney, 5, Autism dx  Fred, 7, NT</div>'

'<P>We are in NY. Our EI service coordinator volunteered to fill out a medicaid waiver for us. She said it was good to have in the event that at some point we needed to supplement therapies or equipment or if our financial situation ever changed. We said fine. We filled it out with her and had to send a copy of Aidan\'s Vineland scores. Our income was <strong>not</strong> a factor. If income was a factor we would have never been eligible. It was approved and we have the waiver. The only problem we faced was that Aidan\'s scores were a little high in their opinion for the waiver. If Aidan\'s scores on the Vineland go up at all they will revoke the waiver. </P> <P>Just wanted to recap, this was a pianless process for us that involved little to no effort. Our only problem was the fact that they basically use the Vineland on its own to determine that your child has a developmental disability - not the diagnosis. But we did receive it, at least for now, it was timely and required nothing more than filling out a form with our coordinator. Income played no role in the approval process. We are fortunate in that for now we actually don\'t need it as we our receiving all the services we need, but it is nice to know it\'s there incase we do.</P>'

'<P>Hello;</P> <P>I am new to he forum. My son is 9, and he has mild autism symptoms (was diagnosed with autism at 5, then there were questions about the diagnosis). He is very sweet and affectionate, but we do have an issue with behavior, wanting to do everything his way, defiance, oppisitional behavior. It gets very exhasting at times, and it seems that conventional methods of discipline don\'t work... He goes to a special ed class, plus Home School elective classes and music lessons, so I spend a lot of time trying to create the best learning environment for him.</P> <P>I have been in the relationship with a wonderful man, who has tried so hard to establish good peaceful grounds with my son. We\'ve been together for 2 years, and he has expressed concerns about not being able to deal with my son. Last week he left a letter for me saying that he loves me and he has tried to make it work, but he can\'t live with my son. Now I am really feeling like I am against the wall. My son is asking where he is. How do I explain? And how can someone leave when he says he still loves you? If that\'s really true, would he be able to walk away? He said in the letter that he sees a lifelong battle in front of him, and he is not ready for it. I knew it was hard for him, but I didn\'t expect he would leave like that, once and for all.</P> <P>I am starting to think that it\'s best to not get involved in the relationships in the future for the sake of my son\'s and my sanity.</P> <P>Any support or advice would be greatly appreciated.</P>'

'2 months is way too early to correctly identify any developmental delays. My <br />advice is do not worry. Continue to track his early development (like all <br />parents should) and keep a \"baby book\" noting both accomplishments and <br />idiosyncratic behavior.

He is impulsive and has trouble being <br />attentive at times. <br /> <br />Lately he has been having more erratic behavior, getting upset at <br />nothing, losing control and having what I think is some self-regulation <br />issues. He still has night terrors, but not as extreme (only when overly <br />tired). He wakes up early most days )4-5 am) and I have to get him back <br />to sleep. He hates to poop and gets so backed up we usually end up <br />giving an enema (he knows the texture of Miralax and throws up Milk of <br />Mag). He is still rigid with routines. I have even noticed him staring at the <br />lights for long times and spinning the wheels of cars on occasion. He will <br />repeat over and over again ( possible echolalia?). He doesn\'t like to refer <br />to folks in 3rd person-always 1st (he doesn\'t use pronouns very often), <br />He has had some aggression lately (hitting, etc.) which he has never done <br />til a month ago. <br /> <br />Cognitively he scored in the average range. His current OT and doc are <br />sending him for a seizure study to rule this out (the OT was surprised to <br />learn he hasn\'t been diagnosed with ASD....interesting). <br /> <br />With all the \"behavior\" stuff going on, is it still possible to be on the <br />spectrum but have some \"normal\" behaviors without having typical red <br />flags? He is very sociable and loves people. He smiles wonderfully and <br />shows empathy. Are we missing something here? Could it be OCD or <br />something else? I am at a loss. His outbursts and tantrums don\'t seem <br />typical of a preschooler. I think the therapists and docs aren\'t seeing the <br />whole picture. Any ideas? Again, sorry so long, but I am going nuts!!!'

'<P>We just came back from a cross-continent trip. I had been worried about ds dealing with the different food and language and schedule and time change but he did amazingly well. Sometimes I underestimate him. We had a few little meltdowns but not bad at all, especially considering that he (and everyone else) got the flu while there. </P> <P>The only tense moment was when we came back. I had tried to prepare him with social stories of what was going to happen and how long it would all take. He managed the 11 hours total on the plane pretty gracefully but once we had to line up for passport check and customs he totally lost it. I think the standing in line, being tired and fluorecent lights just pushed him over the edge. He was screaming and trying to run and screamed at the immigration officer that he was an idiot and wasting his time. I thought they were going to haul us into an interrogation room. I was trying to figure out how to explain Aspergers to them while trying to calm ds before he\'d start trying to run again. I\'m sure he would have hit or bit the officers if they would try to stop him physically which they were moving to do. Thankfully they let us pass through. Next time I think I will have him wear a medical bracelet and bring a doctor\'s note just in case because that could have gone very badly.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- micki, mom to three wonderful and wild kids.  ds 10 asperger & anxiety  twin dds 6 quirky but NT this far</div>'
'I would check which airline you are flying and see if they will let you hold your autistic son. We had a diaster last time we flew on Southwest. They allowed me to hold Jason who was 3 1/2 at the time on the way to Utah (2 1/2 hr flight) but the plane on the way home broke down and so they had to put us on a flight with lots of people and they made him stay in a seat buckled in almost the entire 2 1/2 hrs back which meant major trauma for him and alot of unhappy people.

'Hi..I just wanted to say thanks for starting such a thought-provoking thread Nikki. I think you mentioned some important points for us all to think about, whether we agree or disagree. In a perfect world, the autistic child would not stand out, would not be teased, would not have to WORK at just learning to play. For the past month, we\'ve been waiting on orders to move back to the states, and I might be a bad mom for it, but I really slacked on the therapy for Jakob...For this little bit of time, I just want him to be the happy baby that he is, I know as soon as we hit stateside, it\'s going to be therapy, therapy , therapy for probably the rest of his life. I kinda feel like I\'ve been in the eye of the storm for the past month. I think your take on things would be wonderful if society would allow it...I just don\'t think it\'s ever gonna happen.

'Well I just had my first autism group meeting for parents. I am so overwhelmed, but I knew if I told you guys about it you would understand. Right now I am happy, depressed, worried, and tired at the same time. I meet other parents who were having more issues with their children than I am and I have two with autism. One parent just found out two days ago. She was crying and shaking. When I came home I just looked at my four year old that is high functioning and put my head on his chest. The tears just came out. Some how he must have understood how I felt because he put his arm around my head and gave me a kiss more than once. He even looked me straight in the eye. I would like to start my boys on the gluten and cassein free diet. I am so nervous. But I will give it a try.

'<P>I too feel a sense of urgency to intervene in these early years for both of my boys. They best way to get your wif on board is to hear it from a professional, not you. We went to a pediatric psych who specializes in autism. She said you need to do as much ABA as you can and start now. My husband got to hear it from someone other than me that there is a problem and it is neccsart to address this pronto. With our Floortime, we do 20-30 hour a week of VB/ABA and it has brought my son from less than 20 word approximations at age 3 who never seem to connect to a kid who is so much fun, talks all day and is very much connected. We are just starting the process with my younger guy and he is considered mild at this point. My husband\'s initial reaction, was that he was not as bad as my older guy, thus not neeeding as much intervention. The psychologist impressed the importance of intervention and now we are getting things set up. It\'s much easier to hear from a professional than a spouse. Do you have a diagnosis from a professional such as a psychologist or developmental ped? </P> <P>I agree that the more you can interact and engage with your little guy the better. Sometimes, it\'s not which therapy or model, rather the intensity and quantity of how much he is engaged. we hire VB tutors to implement my older guy\'s program and they also do some Floortime. I work very hard 1:1 with my little guy throughout the day and we are soon going to start a program for him.</P> <P>I hope that was somewhat helpful.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom of 2 boys  4 year old ASD  2 year old ASD</div>'
'The not wanting to share thing is soo typical of that age with ANY kid.<br><br>Some parents give their child one special item that they do NOT have to share.

'<P>Super: </P> <P>What a great post. I think you are handling everything quite well. I will be interested in what the \"coach\" has to say about the purpose of the lectures. </P> <P><strong>\"Social congition\" turns out to be dissected EVERY little piece of EVERYTHING imaginable to the greatest detail. Read big long explanations of each facial expression and memorize them. Apply acronyms to providing support to friends. Attempt to force eye contact during group activities. Basically, rather than take what we\'ve got and run with it, they\'re trying to turn us into... people who don\'t have autism. I have yet to hear, \"People with ASD are really good at...\" It\'s all about what we\'re <EM>not</EM> good at and how to fix it. Fix it. Fix it. (*From you post)</strong></P> <P>I struggle daily with the issues you are talking about above. My boys are moving along and improving rapidly. I argue often with the \"experts\" about stimming, eye contact and general acceptance of their quirks. I let them stim (not alot..but when they need to). I don\'t demand unusual amounts of eye contact. But then again...I don\'t notice NT folks making unusual amounts of eye contact during a conversation. In fact, too much eye contact makes MOST people uncomfortable...not just those on the spectrum. I let L sit in the corner and sing (great rote memory skills). And I let R line up his toys (to perfection, might I add). Not suprising that these things that give them enjoyment are the two things they blew away on the IQ tests. Puzzles, Math, Memory; Yet the nagging continues. Don\'t let him flap in public. Let\'s try to stop him from lining ANYTHING up. Try to stop the visual stim where he \"angles\" things/objects. We need him to make more eye contact. We need him to be less structured. </P> <P>Don\'t get me wrong, Super, I continue to work with them on academics and motor skills and all those things that they will need to lead productive lives. I am providing them with the same things I provided my two older \"NT\" kids. Love. Acceptance. And a good basis for their adulthood. I truly think the benefit to my guys is the time they were born in. Socialization has taken on a new meaning. It can be done via computer. The electronic age has created a haven for Aspies and other folks on the spectrum....to lead productive lives in the workforce...and to lead productive lives (as they choose) on a personal level. And for real true lasting relationships, we have a huge family. Brothers, sister, cousins and even some friends that will be there for these guys for the long haul. Am I wrong in my thinking? </P> <P> <strong>I\'m tired of the fixing! I\'ve spent the years since my diagnosis obsessively trying to FIX everything about myself related to the ASD. Do any of you know how GOOD it feels to just be autistic? How happy I am when I\'m nonverbal? But life doesn\'t work like that. I have to talk. I have to work. I have to drive. I have to learn to turn the autism on and off at will, regardless of what I\'m feeling.</strong> (*From your post); </P> <P>I don\'t ever want my sons to feel that I thought they needed to be fixed. Ever. Because they don\'t. They are wonderful people with amazing qualities. I am desperately in love with them. I do require them to do what is necessary, however. To greet people. To say good-bye to people. To intermingle with other children (for as long as they can tolerate). To keep their hands off things in the store. To be quiet in Church. To say please and thank you. To be kind to others. To listen. To smile. To love. To be a good person. To like themselves. </P> <P>They go to a school with children with multi-disabilities; their autism does not make them the \"weird\" kid in class. Nor does another child\'s Downs, nor does another child\'s Brittle Bone and MD. Everyone there has a challenge, and nobody seems to feel superior nor are my children targets for bullying or fun making. This is a constant battle, too. The experts tell me that my kids are perfect for mainstreaming. Both are intelligent (with splinter savant skills). They read and do math and puzzles well above grade level (three grade levels above). But one can\'t put on his own socks (working on that) and the other has extreme sensory issues that would make him fall apart in \"regular\" school. So, they have alot of work ahead of them. At their core, they...like other children need to feel that they are good people and not something broken. I think they also need to feel that they DON\'T have to be like the little boy net to them in order to be accepted. They don\'t have to change who they are in their core to be \"someone\". </P> <P>I think I hi-jacked your post, Super. If so, I a sorry. But your post came at a time when I am struggling with the very issues you describe. I hope you post the outcome of your dilemma. I am interested. Also, I would be interested in YOUR take on my issues. I was looking for someone like YOU to help me. And here you are. IMO</P> <P>PS.

'<P>Hey,</P> <P>It\'s not uncommon for a child with autism to have verbal apraxia. My son is 33 months old with autism and the speech therapist feels he has apraxia as well -like autism wasn\'t enough right???? But he\'s progressing little by little. The thing that has helped my son is the PECS system. They say the PECS promotes language as well. He picked it up in literally a day. I took pictures of breakfast, lunch, snacks, dinner foods and some books and toys and they have velcro on it. He picks what he wants off the book and gives the card to me. So even though he is not talking as of yet he is communicating. You can\'t always base intelligence with language. Albert Einstein was, of course, a genius and spoke very late. He didn\'t have autism but you get my point right?</P> <P>Also, I have my son in pvt. speech therapy 3x a week for a few months now. He is started to make sounds I\'ve never heard (e, m) so I will not give up hope. I feel my son will one day talk and I\'ll have to tell him to SHUT UP!!! lol </P> <P>Hang in there because it\'s a slow process.

'I know it is scary. I just checked out my son\'s possible preschool classes a <br />few weeks ago. I also looked at them and could not imagine him doing all <br />the things the children where doing in the classes. But then I remembered <br />when he started his early intervention class back in April and he couldn\'t do <br />what the kids in that class were doing also. I was so scared for him I stayed <br />at the school in another room the first week he was there. Over time he <br />learned to follow the routines and got use to the teachers and aides. He can <br />now even sit for circle time but still not really too verbal. I hope when he <br />starts school in December, he will also adapt.'
'Your boss is wrong. If you as an individual report it and it prompts an investigation and the family sues, they\'re not going to sue you. they\'re going to sue your company. <br /> <br />You, as an individual do not have the insight to warrant a report, but you as the employee do have the insight. Which makes your company responsible. <br /> <br />Plus, if they sue, its not because they want to punish you, its because they want money. No lawyer is going to take their case if your company is not sued. <br /> <br />Your boss should support you and as a company stand on the right leg because they\'ll ultimately get the backdraft anyway, even if they don\'t care about their clients (i.e. the kids).'

'Unfortunately, kids aren\'t math problems. Most often there is a standard amount of therapy given based on how far behind the child is and what the issues are. Then adjustments are made based on the child\'s tested progress - or lack of it. In New York, no child can get speech therapy for less than two half hour sessions per week. It\'s the only therapy, that I know of, with a MINIMUM. At kindergarten age, children who are classified under \"autism\" are guaranteed at least one half hour of speech therapy DAILY. That is what NYS thinks is right for autism, especially since speech/language tests all too often don\'t get at the worst part of speech for ASD kids - pragmatics. The truth is that if your girls are not making enough progress to get them to the 25th%ile of language ability by kindergarten, they probably DO need more therapy. The school district is NOT required to get them to the average, only to the average range. Since speech seems to be their greatest issue right now, it might behoove you to get a good outside speech therapist to test them. You can request an IEE or do it on your own dime (this is a GOOD use of private money because YOU can then control what you share and what you don\'t. It\'s also not an ONGOING expense but good ammunition to get the ONGOING expenses paid for thru the district). I think the book will help you figure out your next steps, which will be testing. I would probably pay for this testing myself if I were you. In fact, I\'m going to get my son some specialized reading testing, privately, because the school is starting a new reading program with him. I want to get my own levels NOW and then ask for those SAME tests to be done by the District in June. Then we\'ll see for sure how much progress he\'s made with this new program. For those parents who DO have some money, it\'s probably best to pay for ammunition rather than for the therapy itself. That makes the money stretch further.'

'<P>Sorry for posting so much lately, but I just had to get this out there.</P> <P>Awhile back, I posted about some concerns I had with my older boy, whom I was thinking of getting evaluated for Asperger\'s. I decided to put it off, thinking that it wasn\'t really affecting him all that much, but I got a rude awakening today.</P> <P>He\'d been showing some real problems making friends with kids, and in playing with his brothers (his way or the highway is his motto). Anyways, to cap it all off, tonight, he snuck out of his room when he was supposed to be sleeping, grabbed up our three month old kitten, and took him up to the top bunk of his bed. Max is terrified of stuff that high, so I guess he tried to get away. Bran didn\'t like this, so he grabbed the poor thing by the tail and wouldn\'t let go. He hurt him really badly (poor thing can\'t bend his tail in the middle), to the point that he actually defecated on the bed.</P> <P>Needless to say, this was disturbing to us! Eventually, we sat him down and talked with him once again about the inappropriateness of what he had done. Finally, exasperated, I asked him, \"Do you even care that Max is hurt?\" And he flat out said, \"No, I don\'t.\"</P> <P>This is a positively SCARY display of a lack of empathy, imo, and I\'m going to get him in to see a psych ASAP and start evaluating him for Asperger\'s after all. He\'s had issues to this point, and yeah, he will likely realize he\'s being tested, but this has to be done, and I really think it could help him, because we are certainly having no success in teaching him empathy, turn-taking, sharing, etc. This in addition to his \"little professor\" tendencies, his difficulty relating to peers (but not adults), not to mention a younger brother already diagnosed with autism, I think I have to have this done. He\'s really a great kid, and I don\'t understand this behavior at all! </P> <P>It may turn out that something else (like a personality disorder) is going on, but I really think the Aspie thing is more likely. What do you all think? I don\'t want to make the wrong decision AGAIN, like I did by talking myself out of having Jason evaluated for so long.</P> <P>I\'m really upset, and I just had to get this off my chest. <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"> Thanks for listening.</P> <P>P.S. Max just woke up from a little -uh- catnap, and his tail seems to be doing much better. Good thing, since our vet doesn\'t take emergency calls unless it\'s drastic! I was worried his tail might be broken, but he\'s starting to lift it up and bend it more. *whew* But it\'s still \"hands off\" for Bran until further notice.</P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Evie on July 13 2007 at 11:20pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>-    J, 5 yrs, classic autism (nonverbal)    Also mom to:  B, 9 yrs (NT?)

The Wechsler scales contained separate subscores for verbal and performance IQ, thus being less dependent on overall verbal ability than early versions of the Stanford-Binet scale, and was the first intelligence scale to base scores on a standardized <A title=\"Normal distributi&#111;n\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distributi&#111;n\" target=\"_blank\"><FONT color=#0000ff>normal distribution</FONT></A> rather than an age-based quotient: since age-based quotients worked only for children, these methods were replaced by a projection of the measured rank on the <A title=\"Normal distributi&#111;n\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distributi&#111;n\" target=\"_blank\"><FONT color=#0000ff>Gaussian bell</FONT></A> curve using an average IQ of 100 as the center value and a <A title=\"Standard deviati&#111;n\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviati&#111;n\" target=\"_blank\"><FONT color=#0000ff>standard deviation</FONT></A> of 15 or occasionally 16 or 24 points.</P> <P>Thus, the modern IQ score is a mathematical transformation of a raw score on an IQ test, based on the rank of that score in a normalization sample,<SUP =reference id=cite_ref-11><A title=\"\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iq_test#cite_note-11\" target=\"_blank\"><FONT color=#0000ff>[12]</FONT></A></SUP> Modern scores are sometimes referred to as \"deviance IQ\", while older method age-specific scores are referred to as \"ratio IQ\".</P> <P>The two methodologies yield similar results near the middle of the bell curve, but the older ratio IQs yielded far higher scores for the intellectually gifted&#151; for example, <A title=\"Marilyn vos Savant\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_vos_Savant\" target=\"_blank\"><FONT color=#0000ff>Marilyn vos Savant</FONT></A>, who appeared in the <A title=\"Guinness World Records\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records\" target=\"_blank\"><FONT color=#0000ff>Guinness Book of World Records</FONT></A>, obtained a ratio IQ of 228. While this score could make sense using Binet\'s formula (and even then, only for a child), on the Gaussian curve model it would be an exceptional 7.9 standard deviations above the mean and hence virtually impossible in a population with a normal IQ distribution (see <A title=\"Normal distributi&#111;n\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distributi&#111;n\" target=\"_blank\"><FONT color=#0000ff>normal distribution</FONT></A>). In addition, IQ tests like the Wechsler were not intended to reliably discriminate much beyond IQ 130, as they simply do not contain enough exceptionally difficult items.<SUP><A class=\"external aut&#111;number\" title=http://www.minddisorders.com/Py-Z/Wechsler-Intelligence-Scale-for-Children.html href=\"http://www.minddisorders.com/Py-Z/Wechsler-Intelligence-Scale-for-Children.html\" rel=nofollow target=\"_blank\"><FONT color=#0000ff>[2]</FONT></A></SUP></P> <P>Since the publication of the WAIS, almost all intelligence scales have adopted the normal distribution method of scoring.

'I think if you read on this site for awhile, you\'ll understand about \"mild\" versus more severe forms. Frankly, I think using the word \"mild\" with any of the autism spectrum disorders is like saying someone has mild cancer. Perhaps that\'s overly dramatic, but ASD destroys the foundation of development if it is not addressed early and often. You might want to look into more aggressive therapies like ABA. Your son is still young enough for his neurological system to change to some degree from the sort of therapy he gets. There really is NOTHING mild about any form of autism. It\'s just that some forms are less involving than others. But ALL children who have this disorder have brains that have been hardwired VERY differently, so the approach to their upbringing and education has to be quite different, too.'

'<FONT size=1>My friend has a brilliant son of 29 who got a late diagnosis of Aspergers. He has an IQ of 160, but has never been able to hold a job, even as a janitor. He ran off and married some girl he met on the internet from chile, but is now coming back to his parents house because he can\'t hold a job in Chile either, and his Disability from the US is his only income. It\'s sad. I have accepted, and alredy faced that my child will probably do best in a sheltered workshop. It\'s hard for us to change our goals and dreams for our kids, but I think it\'s far better to accept than to make our kids anxious about what WE want for them. My son seems happy the way he is. His own goals for himself are different from NTs. My son is very high functioning and NOBODY thinks he has autism...NOBODY. It is still there and in the way of his leading a NT life. I think acceptance that the kids are different is important. It helps us take one day at a time, and, as they grow up, assess them with calmness, deciding the best plan for their future. I was told that 99% of kids diagnosed PDD-NOS need help with living when they are adults and not that different from Aspergers. The source was our NeuroPsych from Mayo Clinic. That doesn\'t mean they aren\'t having good lives. In fact, Aspies like the 29 year old who is trying so hard to live a \"normal\" life and rejecting his diagnosis is far more miserable than one who has more realistic goals for hiself. That 29 year old has tried to kill himself several times because he\'s \"stupid\" (his own word).

'Do you know what protocols your team has already tried? <br /> <br />Can he read?

If he already repeats all the time, teaching <br />him appropriate phrases to say won\'t really work because it is just <br />teaching him to continue to repeat you. <br /> <br />Another idea would be to have two people, one who is the prompter and <br />one who is the converser. The prompter could sit behind him and prompt <br />what to say and the converser can respond and ask questions. If he tries <br />to repeat the phrase 20 times or inappropriately the prompter or the <br />converser which ever he would response to better should cut him off by <br />holding up a hand to show \"stop\" or interrupting him by doing some other <br />quick demands like imitation or receptive commands. <br /> <br />Besides programs for the echolalia what are some programs he is working <br />on in ABA to develop appropriate language?

'Melissa...<br> <br> It does sound like your daughter needs more support....most of these kids need constant modeling, repitition, facilitation, etc....most of these kids don\'t just pick up skills incidentally or at least not at the same rate as NT kiddos do....I don\'t think you should hesitate to ask for more and the staff should definitely have training (you really need a special ed teacher). Your daughter is still young...the perfect time to get serious intervention. I do think it is great that your daughter has so many models but she also (just a guess here) needs some facilitation to break tasks and communication down. You should also (just a suggestion) make sure they take a proper baseline of your daughter so that you have something to measure her progress against. ...you really need a program where data is being collected on your daughter so that you can see the progress and hold the school accountable for her progress (and that takes trained staff and a better ratio than 18:3). <br> <br> Best of luck<br>'

'<P>I just wanted to say that I feel your pain. My oldest son (who has a different disease) got down to 2 foods - pb and fritos. He wasn\'t even on the growth charts for almost 3 years. At one point, I became fearful for his life. We bypassed a feeding tube with feeding therapy and removing his tonsils. We still have no idea why taking his tonsils out helped. Feeding therapy helped my husband and I stay on the same page. We were continuosly fighting over how to get him to eat (neither of us was successful). Autism is so much easier on our marriage than that was. It was awful. He is still only 39 lbs at 6 years of age. He is eating 100\'s of foods now but still has set backs occasionally. </P> <P>We are in the process of moving back to Missouri to get ABA for my daughter through First Steps.

'<P>I don\'t know if I have significantly different perceptions than non autistic people as I\'ve never looked into it, or talked about it. I know there are some things that are becoming more obvious. For example someone wrote once that when a person on the spectrum goes into a room they focus on parts of it, rather than the whole room. Well, when I go into a room I find myself looking automatically at segments of it and concentrating on the lines on a table, or a bit of fluff on the floor, but I thought everyone did that. And I\'ll see, for example, a bookcase, but I automatically divide it up into \"shelf, shelf, shelf\" and those shelves into \"line, longer line, line, longer line\". I\'ve probably got some differences in processing information, sometimes there\'s a delay (eg I can\'t let go of a ball to throw it, or I can\'t understand or respond to what someone\'s saying) but other times I can be very fast (eg I can read a page in a few seconds). But because these are just my experiences I don\'t know if they are relevant.

'<P>My son is older, but maybe what I have used with him will help you out. I tried the time-out (no go) and the removing of privilages (no go). I finally did something that it amazed me that I had not thought of it sooner...I talked to him. I sat down with him and asked him if he would like it if someone hit him whenever they were frustrated. He struggles with empathy and undestanding that others have feelings like he does. Once I put it to him in that manner it was easier to use the other methods effectively. The trick with Shawn was to keep the conversation short and to the point when he was not in melt-down mode. He and I came up with a catch word for when he is frustrated so that we all understand what is going on with him. We also have a catch word for when I correct his behavior (i.e. I say fruitloop when he is exhibiting signs of frustration). When I say the catch word it is his cue to go to his safe area (an area of the house that is his personal space where no one will disturb him so he can cool down.) Once he has cooled down he is better able to verbally express what the problem is. The same idea goes for when he says his catch word. This does not mean that he will not have consequences for misbehavior...just a way to head off the train before it crashes or to prevent escilation of the situation. Once he is calm we discuss the problem then discipline is implimented. The key to the catch words is that they must be complelty non-sequitor to any possible situation where it will be needed. I cannot think of a situation where saying fruitloop would fit into a sentance unless you were discussing what you wanted for breakfast. </P> <P> </P> <P>This method did not immediately extingush the hitting, but over a short period (a couple months) the hitting has greatly diminished in frequency. He used to hit his younger sister at least 4-5 times/day. Now he might hit once a week. Still not great, but it is a wonderful improvement. This method also helps him self-regulate. I am a single mother of three kids...I cannot watch him like a hawk to make sure he is not doing something that he shouldn\'t. No parent can do that for their child. This also prevents him from being embarassed if it happens in public. I can just say fruitloop instead of admonishing him in front of a lot of people. No one but us knows what it means.</P> <P> </P> <P>I know this may sound as though I have taken a big fall and hit my head, but it really has worked wonders in our house. Just a thought that may help.

'<P>Sally - It has been my experience here in the States that pediatricians are totally out of the loop. This has been the experience of every mother I\'ve spoken to. Pediatricians have practically accused us of being nuts that there was something wrong with our kids. \"He\'s a boy, don\'t worry.\" \"You are older parents, you do everything for him. No wonder he\'s not talking.\" \"Kids develop at different rates - stop worrying.\" \"He\'s an only child. They talk later.\" BTDT. I began worrying about my son\'s speech when he was a year and a half old. Everyone told me to wait. By the time he was 2 and was still not talking, the pediatrician told me to wait another 6 months. I was through waiting, so I took him to another pediatrician who was receptive to giving me a prescripton for a hearing test and speech eval. Our son had no odd habits at that time, so I was just concerned about his speech. As fate would have it, we ended up with a speech therapist who specialized in autism. This was a complete coincidence because we didn\'t know when we chose him at random that this was his specialty. HE saw the signs and recommended a therapeutic preschool. We were off to the races! BUt if we\'d stuck with our original pediatrician, who knows how long it would have taken to get services. Our son entered preschool before age 2.5 and has been getting help ever since (he\'s 15 now). </P> <P>I think of pediatricians as mechanics. They know if anything is wrong with any of the parts. They take height, weight, temperature, etc. They know about disease. But they simply are not familiar with development. That is not their \"thing.\" Of course, it should be. But we moms know more about development from our baby books than the average pediatrician knows (unless she\'s also a mother - apologies to men, but that\'s the truth). That is why there\'s a specialty called Developmental Pediatrics. It takes a totally separate type of pediatrician to know about development. But that does not take care of the original problem. That the child\'s regular doctor can\'t see what is abnormal in the first place. It\'s criminal that pedicatricians are not drilled in infant and early childhood development enough so that they can point moms in the direction of specialists at the first sign of a problem.</P>'
'<P>I have to say I do. </P> <P>This summer when there was a lot of coverage about Chris Benoit , the professional wrestler who killed his wife and son near where I live. Fox news reporters ,both print and television nationally kept referring to thier son as retarded. I got very angry about this because although I did not know this couple , many people I do know did - and they shared with me how protective of him this couple was in public and that they in no way would have referred to him as retarded . So I went up to the Fox reporters still at the couple\'s house and asked them to please stop referring to him in such a way . It in my opinion is an outdated term that causes great harm to those of us who have special needs children .I felt no one was there to speak up for them , especially for Daniel but I sure was going to try . </P> <P> The reporters that where there and heard me were very courtious towards me and I think I got through to them.

'<P>Not being shy and being able to act out things are great characteristics for being in a theatre group. If your son is enthusiastic about it and if you feel this is going to be good for him, then sign him in and you\'ll see how it goes. It might be great or it might be a total disaster. I\'m not very helpful am I?:) I\'m just saying, no matter what kind of experience any parents here have had, It\'s not going to give you a clear picture of what it will be like for your son. But I guess it\'s nice to hear stories of others, especially if they\'re positive.</P> <P>We wanted to put Em in a gym class last year-just a fun class with trampolines and running around, nothing serious. There were about 8 kids, but Em couldn\'t take it because of the noise. We only went two or three times and it didn\'t go too well for us. Might try again this year-I thought putting him in kindergarten was going to be so hard-but so far he\'s having a great time, no problems at all! Kids might surprise us.</P> <P>A theatre group sounds really great, it should help with socialization, coordination, self esteem and loads of other things.

'<P>I totally agree with tzoya. IEP meetings are where you get your answers and the schools are not allowed to say no to a parent when the parent requests one. We have been through 3 of them this year and a 4th one is planned for in early May. If you are not happy with results at the IEP there should be other contact numbers within your state that you can call. The case worker at our school isn\'t very good and I have had to file a few complaints. Don\'t wait, if your gutt is telling you something isn\'t right, ask questions so that you can get results. The IEP is all about finding an environment for your child that will allow him to progress and not regress. Something to remember.....never use the words \"best environment\", because best to one isn\'t always the same. As tzoya said you need to find the least restrictive environment in which he can learn.</P> <P>Good Luck! </P>'

If my husband and I couldn\'t take Isaiah to his other ST out of town my dad would take him. (my dad\'s retired). At the age of 4 Isaiah did preschool all day 8-3 M-F so my dad or husband watch him after school until I get home at 4:30. Now he is 5 and is kindergarten all day 8-3 M-F.

'My Son is 3 years old and is high functionning, doing great since he started therapy 4 months ago and if it was not his temper and some stim he would look completly NT. He is very bright but has sensory issues. My other son is 14 months and i am so afraid he will be on the spectrum. I am looking at him and kind of not giving him the time to reach his milestone. He doesn\'t speak really but babbles, say mamamama only when cries and imitates us very easily. He understand very easily one step command but doesn\'t wave bye-bye, used to do it but doesn\'t do anymore, will do only if i keep asking him, doesn\'t clap but tries, hides his face with a clothe if i ask him to and put the phone on his ear if he sees me do it! Basically he is very different with my older son, sleeps well and much better than my oldest, doesn\'t have food issues he could eat everything and switched to adult food very quickly. <br>He likes books very much, tv as well, show me when i ask him where is the apple on the book or look at it. Imitates the monster sound when i ask him too. Very handy compared to my oldest.!!! Anyway i guess it is just a speech delay and we speak more than one language at home so maybe it is the reason. Whatever he does i wonder if it is normal, like he likes to look at ceilings and smile! Does babies do that? He smiles at me when i do it, express himself by moving his body when i ask him if he wants more of water of play or whatever he likes. <br>I just don\'t want to go through the whole evaluation thing so soon. I have read somewhere that we have to wait untill 18 months. My husband is not worried at all and he was very worried and knew something was wrong with our oldest and not me!<br>What do you think? it looks that he is advances in few areas like receptive language and motor, he walks and crawled normally, my oldest walked at 10 months and never crawled because couldn\'t use his hands that were very week! But delayed in few like speech. He has non verbal communication which my oldest didn\'t really have. He doesn\'t point really but makes us understand, he points but not necessarily to show us things he wants. <br>'

'What are your days like-in regards to routine? Is your wife home alone w/ the kids, are you? I know it\'s frustrating to have a kid act like your son does, but there is a reason why. I know all kids thrive on a routine, what is yours? Is there a way to play alone w/ Alex a few times a day, for a few minutes? Simple \"games\" he could do well or where the outcome matters not-blocks, magna doodle, play-doh, even Connect four (don\'t worry about the four in-a-row). You could even roll a ball to each other back and forth. I know you are frustrated by his lack of expressive communication, and I would bet he is too. It is so hard for him, you, your wife, the other boys...Alex is SO LUCKY to have you!'
'<P>Hi Steff,</P> <P>Thank you so much for responding. We have wondered if there is too much sensory stuff going on in Walmart for him to handle. Jimmy is going to be 5 on xmas day. SO he should know better then to behave that way, but if he is in sensory overload does that mean he cant help acting that way. Jimmy has very good verbal skills but I am not sure he knows how to properly communicate how he is feeling at all times. Lately he has been covering his ears for certain sounds that didnt seem to bother him before. He has also started stuttering. And now this new development in behavior issues. If he cant help the way he is acting then I dont want to discipline him, but he cant get away with what he is doing either.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Jimmy\'s mommy  DOB 12/25/05  Diagnosed Autism on 8/8/08  He gives me a run for my money, but he is my best little buddy</div>'

'Beautiful job, Karrie and Adam! I think it\'s a good idea to start with this stuff early. It\'s a recent initiative in our house, as well.

They prefer to have things done for them rather than doing it themselves. So, we\'ve also begun to raise our expectation for the girl\'s taking care of these sorts of things.

I don\'t know any therapist myself who have kids on the spectrum so I\'m not sure what the stress is like. I wouldn\'t be able to go home in the evenings to a peaceful home so to speak.

'<P><FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=3>Hi. My name is Cathie and my son Tyler was diagnosed in November; he goes to a great school and he loves it there but I think he will be in a life skills school rather than an academic school when he is a little older. That is fine with me because I want him to be as independent as possible.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=3>Tyler has been delayed his whole life. He was born premature but apparently it has nothing to do with the pdd nos. He started having seizures when he was about 4 which resulted in an MRI. It didn\'t tell us much, just that his brain has several areas that are underdeveloped or not properly functioning. I don\'t recall any of the doctors mentioning autism until about a year ago. Anyway, I had him evaluated in Chicago and am now looking for a therapist/doctor that specializes in autism spectrum disorders and am having a terrible time. I live in a rural area of Illinois and will have to travel at least 2 hours for autism specific treatment. That is fine with me, I just don\'t really know what to ask or to look for in treatment. The spectrum is so broad and so different for every child that I\'m not sure what I\'m looking for. Does anyone else know what I mean?</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=3>I have a very supportive family and our town is supportive, too. At the youth baseball games, everyone is so nice and doesn\'t seem to be bothered by the loudness or the lack of awareness of his space. Tyler is very sociable but doesn\'t know how to interact - he is happy and smiling and very friendly to people and other kids, but he tries to play and ends up pushing and hitting because he doesn\'t know how to play. I jsut have tow atch him very closely. He is getting quite aggressive though. Tyler\'s dad and I are divorced (not pdd related) and I have since remarried to the most understanding and supportive man! He has been a god-send to us. We have 4 kids but Tyler is the only one with special needs. I worry about my daughter (6) and her resenting Tyler or me becuase he takes up so much time. I try to give her special time and she is so helpful with all the kids! She is quite the little mom-but in a helpful way.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=3>Anyway, I hope to find a lot of answers and friends here, too. Even if you have incredibly supportive friends and family it is still so important to have those who are experiencing the samething because it is so hard to understand unless you are living it.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=3>If anyone is in eastern Iowa or western Illinois and knows of a good doctor or therapist please let me know.

'<P>I decided to pull out my dd\'s past evaluations. I go through these phases where I believe she is fine and then sometimes I go back to wondering why she was not dx\'d with asd. </P> <P>I think the most confusing thing is the social part of the dx. I hear all the time that children with asd are social, engaged...etc. This is what kept doctors from giving her the label.</P> <P>One report says that my dd displays stereotypical hand movements at times of excitement and was seen when she was playing with a toy. It also said she was preservating about a toy she left at a childs house but overall she had excellent eye contact, used long sentences and spoke freely to the examiner. He noted that she would sometimes mix up he and she and I reported that she calls herself \"you\" but he did not see any of this during the interview. At the end of the report it says \"stereotypical movement disorder\" and a \"possible, subtle language disorder\" and he wanted her further evaluated by a speech therapist. She was three at the time.</P> <P>Another report, she just turned four, said she did not feel my dd was asd because \"she entered the room and easily seperated from her mother. She went to see the toys and said \"look Mom, they have puzzles!\" The doctor felt this was joint attention and told me that children with asd usually do not share joint attention.</P> <P>Now, here is my question...I remember my daugher commenting about the puzzles. I remember her saying \"look MOM...\" She does this ALL the time. She want to show me things she made...she wants me to see her favorite websites, shows on TV...etc. Is this really joint attention? Or is she just rambling? She does NOT look back at me to see if I am really looking back at her. She is goes on and on verbally about things. </P> <P>I really think she is on the spectrum. I think she is mild and its very hard to see unless you know what to look for. </P> <P>I am torn if I should still seek a dx or if I should wait it out and see if I \"need\" to if any problems come up in school.</P> <P>She stims like crazy. She has only had one stim, the finger wiggling when she is excited, like watching something spin. Her language is NOT typical at all. She is very matter of fact, will talk all day if you let her but she only states the facts, she does not have the typical five year old back and fourth chatter. She is also very repetitive, we have a lot of the same questions/conversations. She is getting by though. Her school just evaluated her again for speech therapy, she was denied again because she is not \"delayed.\" All her speech and language scores in the past have put her in the age appropriate range. I dont get it. </P> <P>Socially, she can have friends. BUT, I think these little girls put a lot more effort in the relationship than she does. I worry she will start appearing weird though. She talks about strange things over and over...like birth stones and my name...her dad\'s name and her brothers names. Its odd. I wonder if she is being repetitive because of asd or if she really has no idea what to talk about so she brings up something familiar and comfortable. </P> <P>Any advise? I am feeling crummy today, I have lots of fear again and I have no idea where its coming from...I hate these days. </P> <P> </P> <P> </P>'
'<P>I actually just had a good laugh reading these posts. Not even so much for what the children do but I am noticing that the parents here have quite a sense of humor about all this!</P> <P>Right after My son and daughter in law had the second baby my grandson didnt really seem to give a hooot one way or another. A few months into it just all starting one day he would start to have meltdowns if anyone held the baby. We thought it was actually cute but he was very distressed. His other grandmother was the first to be in the fireing range. When she picked up the baby one day he started carrying on something fierced yelling BE CAREFUL BE CAREFUL THE BABY THE BABY!!!! (and this went on until the baby was handed back over to their mom) Two days later I picked up the baby while in the kitchen and he did the same thing but drug in her little baby seat and insisted I put her in it all the time almost in tears repeating Be careful! </P> <P>At the same time if they would leave the baby with one of us and get ready to leave he totally melted down yelling NO THE BABY! He cried and carried on until they would take the baby with. This went on for a few months then stopped as quick as it started. </P> <P>He also is a Thomas fan and has everything Thomas but also all other trains as well. Geo Trax is an obsession as well. He will play with them for hours on end. He made me take pictures of him holding every single Geo Trax train he had one at a time with my digital camera since he loves seeing the picture right away. He counts the trains, sorts the trains, lines the trains up, every picture he paints has to have a railroad crossing, etc. But you know really I wonder if the Thomas thing really is an \"autism\" thing because I know many many perfectly \"normal\" little boys that seem equally obsessed with the trains. </P> <P>Anne</P>'

'<P>Ok, you want honest, here it is. Life sucks sometimes (and I don\'t say that word very often). It\'s hard. I feel like the dork in our circle. I am knitting right now, I read a LOT, don\'t have a lot of attention for TV, don\'t really want to go to loud and large events anymore, and just like staying home relaxing. </P> <P>Add in that both of our sons prefer home, it\'s not often we really do things. When we do, the boys want to come home. I hear, from our older son, very often, \"Mommy, I just want to go home\". I know that means he\'s not able to handle the stimulus that\'s going on around him. So, if at all possible, we leave. Church is OK, but it can be rocky. If things don\'t go exactly right, it\'s bad. If they do, it\'s beautiful. I am learning to accept that. </P> <P>My step sister is moving to a group home. It\'s a home with 3 other women. She has her own room and shares a bathroom with one other woman. The rest of the house is communal. For her, I think it\'s the best possible answer.

So, this fellow dork will be dorky right along with you, if you don\'t mind. </P> <P>Now, if you desire more, go for it. I don\'t know how you need new things introduced to you, but figure out what you would like, talk to those that help you, and move towards trying them. You might find a new passion.

'thanks guys. One thing I was thinking about was someone (maybe it was <br />nowwhat?) posted a link to an article on brain development by National <br />Geographic. It talked about times where neurons multiply exponentially, <br />then undergo pruning. It said the first time this happens is birth to <br />eighteen months, and it\'s believed that in regressive autism something <br />goes wrong in this process and the pruning doesn\'t happen right. <br />However, it said this happens AGAIN at around 11 years of age, which is <br />less known. <br /> <br />Reading that, made me wonder if this is what\'s going on with Don. <br />Perhaps his brain is going through a little growth spurt, and, since he\'s in <br />a good, stable home that meets his needs now (versus an abusive <br />neglectful home where he was as a baby/toddler), his brain is doing the <br />right things? <br /> <br />Whatever the reason, I\'m enjoying it. <br /> <br />Tonight when he was going to bed, he asked where I was and his dad told <br />him I was sleeping (I was reading in bed, taking it easy, since I\'ve got to <br />work tonight). Don came running to the crack of the door and called out, <br />\"are you tired mom?\". <br /> <br />I could go on and on... <br /> <br />Notime - no sign of puberty yet. In fact, Donny\'s penis and testicles are <br />VERY small (like the size of my cousin\'s 5 month old baby\'s!), and he\'s got <br />no body hair starting or anything like that. Still quite baby faced and <br />tends to be chubby. We\'re mildly concerned that there\'s a hormone <br />problem, based on his \"goods\" being so tiny, but his psych said not to <br />sweat it for another year or two yet. Regardless, I\'m thinking I may make <br />him an appointment with the ped in the near future to get it checked.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Donny 13 - classic autism, bipolar</div>'

'<P>Okay, another question...sorry I have so many and nobody to answer them just yet. </P> <P>My son (not yet dx) seems to be plugging his ears more and more frequently lately. Once I listen carefully it always the faintest sound (like a train in the background, or a dog barking outside) but he never does it when things are loud to us (ie our baby crying, our dogs barking in the house, my DH yelling - yes he does this a lot). So, do AD kids hear sounds at a common level? For example, is the train in the background the same pitch level as the baby crying in the house? I\'m trying to understand why these faint sounds effect him more. When he plugs his ears, he\'s not upset or anything. He just looks at us like \"la-da-da-da...I\'ll be with you in just a minute...\" Thoughts?</P> <P>Also, in the past I\'ve taken him 4x\'s to the pedi for what I thought was ear infections and turned away cuz his ears looked fine.

'Hi, I posted once before about my son\'s first week of kindergarten. Well, he got in trouble last week for pulling his pants down. I talked to him about it, and he finally explained that he did it because he wanted to go to the counselor\'s office again, because \"it\'s fun there, and there\'s a dollhouse to play with, and candy\". So today he and the other little boys are playing chase the girls around the playground. Not something that was his idea, but he tends to do what all the other kids do, in this case chase each other around the playground. So guess what he decides is a good idea. Pulling his pants down, and wiggling his penis at a girl. YIKES. Yeah, now we have a voucher to take him to a child psychologist. Hopefully noone will sue us. What did I do wrong??? The weird thing is, until last week he NEVER pulled his pants down in public. Never. So I don\'t even know where this is coming from. After some trying I got him to tell me why. Apparently he thought it would scare her, and she would shriek and run away from him like all the other girls were doing. To put this into context, the point of the chasing game is apparently to make the girls scream and run away, and aidan, probably totally overstimulated by the game, decided that since this got such a big reaction last week, it would be a great way to play the game. That\'s my theory. He has no exposure to any kind of sex stuff, so I don\'t think it was from anything perverse, but of course I feel like dirt. And his lovely teacher was all \"Well, he knows it\'s wrong.\" I\'m not quite sure that he really understands why it was wrong. He is having a lot more problems, and is increasingly obsessive about even the tiniest things. We had to exchange another pair of shoes, and he once again tried to keep them in the box. Then he worried about them getting dirty, and refused to wear them. I did get him to wear them, but he kept mumbling that he was going to wash them. We have a psych appointment next week. DOes anyone have any experience with this kind of thing??? Is he a pervert at age 5???? I think I am going to go totally nuts. I feel like the worst mom, and I can\'t figure out what\'s wrong with my son, and I am just freaking out.'
'<P>I have to agree with a lot of the posts. I can remember my frustration when after months of therapy we had seen zero improvement but eventually (after 2-3 years of therapy) something just clicked. My son went from non-verbal to scoring with an adequate in the area of communication on the Vineland. This improvement really didn\'t start until about age 3 and 1/2 and it took 2 years of ABA 20 hours a week to get where we are. There are still things that he struggles with but he is way better than before. </P> <P>My husband was also originally in denial but has come around and is pretty helpful now.

'<P>Sorry, I got the wrong name on my last post. It should be to Candy 26. Now to answer screech 2001\'s email. I believe that milk (in moderation) is okay. I know I have to have (a moderate amount) milk or my bones start yelling back at me. I would be suspect to anything that might have preservatives and additives in it (or sugars). So, I would check the ingredients in the food your little guy favors and make sure he doesn\'t get too much of it. So, I think the verdict is still out on milk, as it builds strong bones (especially along with Vitamin C). I believe moderation in all things is the key. It\'s my opinion that vitamins at your son\'s young age should be limited (except Vitamin C). However, a (very) tiny amount of liquid vitamins in their drink ever so often would be easy for them to take and probably would help. I think when they reach the age of eight or ten and when they start to grow, is when the vitamins should be stepped up a little.</P> <P>I think mainly, the emphasis should be just to get them through the early years and give them plenty of stimulation by getting them out and about and get them talking and taking part in activities. They need intense therapy, both visual and audio, too. If they have trouble with motorization, they may need constant one-on-one therapy, such as in a book I read where the parents enlisted neighbors, friends, etc., to come and give therapy to their child by repeatively moving his limbs (arms and legs, front and back sides) in all kinds of ways over and over, which in turn stimulated his brain. Within a few weeks he was much better and overcame his affliction. Hope this helps.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Best Regards, Marge</div>'
'<P>I have no clue what the difference is. We took our daughter (and son) to CHOP where a whole \"autism team\" (OT, developmental ped, psychiatrist, speech) took a look at them and did the ADOS and some other tests to determine the diagnosis. I think as long as you take them to someone that can diagnose autism from other things your fine. We are really comfortable with our team and that, I think, is what matters. With both children, I feel their diagnoses were right on!</P> <P>And again, at a young age, the diagnoses isn\'t what matters. I feel its only important that they tell you whether they are on the spectrum or not, not necesarily where they are or even how \"severe\" it is. And the only reason I believe in a diagnosis, is because a whole world will open for your child with regard to therapy and services, etc. And that is imperative in the future of these children.</P> <P>Hope I made sense!

'<FONT face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" color=#ff00ff size=3> Sleuth, you know your kids better than anyone else!!! Come on, think about that! I go through this with my family ALOT! One of my brothers used to take Ashtyn to his house when she was younger to play with his kids for the night! He started busting his chops about Ashtyn not having Autism so I let him take her overnight to his home and he brought her back the next day saying\" She absolutely mentally exhausted me, how do you do it?\" AND SHE IS HIGH FUNCTIONG!!! I go through times where I realize I must take a break from it all! But the truth of the matter is that out of sight is not out of mind! I still think, worry and wonder! If I dont do this than who will right? I am so happy that I can come here and exchange worries and wonders with people who understand! I KNOW my children like the back of my hand and the only people I depend on to understand their battles with Autism would be people that have been there themselves!</FONT>'
'What you need is someone who KNOWS autism to observe your son and do a Functional Behavioral Assessment in school. Then a truly helpful behavior plan can be put in place. The fact is ALL behaviors are willful. However ALL behaviors have a reason behind them. OF course \"behaviors\" like seizures or tics are not willful, but just about everything else in human behavior is. However, there is a reason behind EVERY behavior and, once the reason is understood, as sensible plan can be formed to help the child access what he needs withough resorting to behaviors that are generally unacceptable. If the teacher is looking for which behaviors she should PUNISH, she has the wrong mindset. What she SHOULD be trying to do is determine the usefulness of each of your son\'s behaviors and then come up with more appropriate ways for him to act in order to get what he needs and wants. That\'s the FBA/BIP process. To learn more, go to cecp.air.org'

When he gets home he is the same way, needs to have time to himself or he can get pretty ugly. Sometimes he catches himself but then my NT kids get in trouble for things Z does. I whole heartedly feel you on needing the mom time. I ALWAYS have Zack with me. Sometimes he will watch him, well keep him, while I run to the market or something (usually an hour or less) but other than that he doesnt know what to do with him. I went to get my nails done a couple months ago, you know just for some mommy time that he offered. I was gone for 4 hours running errands, picking up meds, and getting my nails done. I got called 6 times in that 4 hours. Including what do I feed him?? (this was pre-gfcf diet). I was like pick something, if he eats it yeah, if he doesn\'t try again. I mean how does he think I get by everyday and figure out what works with him and what doesnt. Its all trial and error. I really feel for Z if anything ever happened to me because dh would wind up in the nuthouse dealing with autism 24/7. If Z is having a meltdown and I am working to help him through it, dh will sit there and just watch us or ignore us, even when it is obvious we are both frustrated. I always step in whenever he gets frustrated with him and dont know what else to do. </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Shannon mom to Austin(NT with Type 1 diabetes), Andrea(NT), Andrew(NT), and Zack (ASD)</div>'

'Autism is genetically based, so I\'m certain the doctor is even more concerned with your son since your daughter has been diagnosed with autism. Not all autism presents alike. May children, especially those who do not have classic autism, are quite social. Their SKILLS in the social arena are often lacking, but their DESIRE to be social is there. And, in one so young, there are no skills - just desire. It\'s imperative for you to investigate whether or not your son has issues. Many siblings of ASD kids don\'t have autism but have speech delays and learning disabilities. The sooner you discover if your son has ANY delays and begin interventions, the better. Please don\'t delay.'

I don\'t blame my husband- what did/does he REALLY know about autism??? I still think should have taken my feelings more seriously, though.

She screamed, \"Stay right where you are,\" unlocked the gate and scooped him up and into the house where we then had a huge meltdown and big to-do.</P> <P>He knows that he is not allowed to go into the pool without us and maybe even more importantly...without his \"green vest\" which is, of course, like a very slimline mae west that is great for him in the pool and gives us piece of mind (I think it is Speedo). I don\'t think he would have gone in, but...you know where I am going.</P> <P>A lot of our babes just have no fear.

'<P>Hi,</P> <P>I\'m a stay at home Dad and my 4yo who has autism. My 2 cents is that by ignoring you should show no emotion, don\'t make eye contact, just clean up hand over hand or whatnot and leave the situation. My son liked being put in time out so we eliminated time out. I would, and have never, hit my son. I believe this just breeds neurosis in your child and yourself. Hope the behavior gets extinguished quickly. Also you may want to instituted the count to 3... followed by quick hand over hand w/ no emotion. Do it a thousand times and your child will obey by 2. consistancy is a key so don\'t get all emo one day and emotionless the next. Good luck.</P>'

I know Dylan has it, it\'s been confirmed. I see he struggles with peers and inappropriate play.

The PDD is \"mild\", for whatever that\'s worth.</P> <P>I was reading someone else\'s post that made me think alot about Dylan. He used to do some really weird stuff LOL! Most of that is gone, though. He would line up things like your son does, Julie, but doesn\'t do that much anymore (neuropsych reported he did that with the matchbox cars, but he doesn\'t do that here at home). He used to have this weird fascination with tires, real ones, on vehicles. He\'d get down on the ground, and \"spin\" them. His hands were dirty 24/7 from constantly doing this. Gone. He used to stand in a corner by himself at recess. All the kids would be out playing, and there\'s Dylan, standing behind a tree, singing to himself. Gone.</P> <P>So, I wonder sometimes.

'Is there hope for my ds to be happy and fullfilled in his adult life? <br />There is a chance that my ds could become high functioning enough to <br />be self-sufficiant. But there is also a chance that he will need life long <br />support in his daily needs. And in some ways I don\'t care which as long as <br />I knew that he will be fullfilled and happy. <br /> My greates fear is that he will be too highfunctioning to qualify for <br />services (and to accept parent involvement) but too low functioning to be <br />able to live independently, hold a job and maintain relationships. These <br />days whenever I see a homeless man I get choked up. My hope is he will <br />be happy and has his place, my greatest fear is that he will be lost in the <br />world. <br />I keep the hope by providing him the opportunities he needs to grow and <br />by making sure that he knows and feels the connection to us and his <br />family. I make sure that he can advocate for himself and ask for help <br />when needed. And I try not to guess too far into the future. I try not to <br />get too wrapped up into my fears and remind myself frequently to enjoy <br />the day in front of me because it is all anyone has anyway.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- micki, mom to three wonderful and wild kids.  ds 10 asperger & anxiety  twin dds 6 quirky but NT this far</div>'

'<P>I have a beautiful 8 year old daughter with aspergers and anxiety disorder. We start to notice things were not quite right with Grace at age 9 mon. She had a very large head that was growing too fast. She like to sit alone in her infant seat and just stare. As she got older she would have meltdowns in walmart because of the fluorescent lights. She hate loud sounds and has many other sensory issues. At first I home school her but this seemed to make anxiety of public places worse. This last year she attend public 2nd grade. She cried every day I dropped her off. But she did do well during the day. Academically she is on track. Her main issue is her inability to write sentence. She still requires speech therapy but doesn\'t receive any other help. I don\'t know any other asperger kids. I would love to home school her but most of her problems are social and I want her to do well as an adult. Do any of you know where I can find a good support? I am looking for a message board or e-mail group or something. I just want someone to share idea with and to sympathize with during our struggles.</P> <P>Thanks</P> <P>Isabel</P>'

'<P>Morgan is 6 and she still acts like cat or a scobby doo dog, it changed by the day. This is crazy, and I should have put a stop to it sooner, but for most of 2004, she wore a tail pinned to her pants. If she didn\'t have this tail, all heck would break loose! She started by taking long pieces of ribbon from my craft room and tucking them into her pants for a tail. THen, one of my friends pinned a tail to her and it went from there. It was a pain, but it made her so happy. When she started school, we made her ditch the tail. She was MAD for a few weeks, but she got over it.</P> <P>When she was about 3, she would bark &amp; growl at people at the store if they tried to talk to her. We didn\'t know she was autistic at the time, we thought she was eccentric like everyone else said, lol.</P> <P>I own a little scrapbook store and she goes to work with me a few times a week. It helps her get used to people and when she starts to get upset or tired, I live around the block, so I just run her home.

'<P>I am not sure that in my state, I would give my credentials to a parent. I have to give all that to the school, the district, the school board, the superintendent of education, etc. And my credentials are accepted if they hire me. My personnel file at the board of edu is limited to board members and board employees, which includes myself. If a parent asked for my credentials, I wouldn\'t mind telling them because I do have a teaching certificate from an accreditated university allowing me to teach in my state. </P> <P>It is the systems\' responsibility to make sure they have teacher\'s who can teach all kinds of kids who will come through the system. Not the teacher\'s responsiblity to defend her education and training to a parent. I think, don\'t know, but think, that if you were to ask me in my current state, I could refuse. Teachers in my state have \"insurance\" so to speak that protects them from things like this. </P> <P>Let me make this clear, I am in no way saying that I don\'t agree with what you are saying or the fact that you want to know what your child\'s teacher is trained to do. But as a teacher, I am teaching the children that the system and sp ed department has chosen to place in my classroom. I don\'t go out claiming I have experience and recruit for cetain kinds of children to be placed in my classroom. I think that the \"hot seat\" should first fall to the sp ed coordinator or principal of the school who might have employed someone not qualified to teach certain things.</P> <P>For example, I have a B.S. in Early Childhood Special Educaiton. That entitles me to work with children ages birth through age 8. I also have a master\'s degree in Collaborative Teaching grades K-12. So, in my state, I am able to work with ANY child birth through 12 grade with ANY disability. I am employed by a school in a large school district. I am the teacher for any child that walks through the front door of my school who has a disability from K all the way through 8th grade. This includes ANY disability. I just happen to have woked at a place where I received training in the area of Autism and have taught children with Autism aged 3 through the 6th grade. I have training in ABA, TEACCH, Floortime, discrete trial, etc. I have experience and some training with picture symbols and picture schedules. I have some experience in working with the OT and SLP for educationally relevant issues in children with ASD. I wouldn\'t mind telling anyone parent in my system this, I just posted it on a public chat board. But let\'s say that my \"training\" with disabilities ended with the sentence \"this includes ANY disability.\" And I had no experience with Austic children and a child with ASD got put in my classroom.</P> <P>IMO it wouldn\'t be my place to have to defend myself. It should be the systems posistion in defending why they think this placement is right for the child with ASD. I am rambling and I know I am. I think that you do have a right to know the training of the person teaching your child. But I think that the \"adminstrators\" should be the one to make squirm in their seat for not having teachers trained in all areas of disabilities. Autism is a new concept in places and unless you tactfully let them know that you want your child to have instruction from someone who knows how to implement things that are appropriate for ASD, they might not know that. Does this make sense?</P> <P>I am certified and HQ to teach any disability in my state in a certain age group. I don\'t have to go get any other \'training\" than what I already have and is required by my state to get a teaching certificate. No parent can make me go back and get more training. So I think that instead of giving the teaher a hard time, you should put pressure on the system to hire teachers who do have training in a specific area such as ASD. Does this make sense? Again, I am not saying I don\'t agree, I am not saying that I think you don\'t have rights as a parent to know the training your child\'s teacher has, and I am not saying your child doesn\'t deserve an education from someone who is knowledgeable enough to use interventions that we know are successful with children with ASD. I am saying that it is the systems responsibiity to provide you with that, not the teacher. </P>'

'OFtentimes, summer programs are staffed not with the regular school year people (who want and need the summer off) but by totally new staff and personnel. It\'s not always ideal. I\'d call the Director after you put your son on the bus tomorrow and asked to speak to her about him and his disability. Pack him the sort of lunch HE likes. And do a lot of talking about tomorrow tonight. Write a social story about what is going to happen. Draw pictures. Present the happiest, calmest front. We have similar problems around here. The first couple of days the bus came at 8:20, just as the bus company said it would. Then it came at 8 - DS son was ALMOST ready. The next day, it came at 7:45 and DS had JUST gotten out of bed. I was furious and called the bus company because rushing DS in the morning is the best way to guarantee a bad day. The bus company set the driver straight. She had the wrong start time and was told that if she came that early to someone\'s house, she was to wait until 3 minutes after the time she was scheduled to arrive, not simply 3 minutes. That means, if she arrives at 7:45 again, she\'ll have to wait in front of the house until 8:23!'
'<P>when i first mentioned to the hv about jakes behaviour we filled out a CHAT test....at all of his meetings with regards to wheteher he has autism this has never been mentioned. as they are unsure even though he displays a lot of traits they dont want to dx him until feb as he has been making some progress. i was wondering if it worthh asking about the results of this as no body has said anything about the results of this too me. how important is this test and the results??</P> <P>any info would be great thank you x</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- mum of Jake age 4 awaiting dx of ASD and kyle aged 3 NT.</div>'
'<P><IMG src=\"smileys/smiley2.gif\" border=\"0\">Yep good to cut out the dairy as it causes bloating, constipation and gut problems. Soy can be detrimental also as it can slow down the thyroid and cause weight gain and hormonal imbalances. It\'s great for menopausal women but I\'d be cautious with young children. Rice milk sounds like a good substitute. Apparently man can survive on brown rice alone and alot of gluten-free products are made with brown rice.</P> <P>Milk was once touted as being the ultimate source of calcium but now we know that the human body has trouble digesting the lactose in the milk. If u have to go with dairy, less of it and try diluting the calcium enriched milk with water.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- 3yr old boy diagnosed with autism</div>'
'My son sort of had a speech delay and he\'s Aspergers. He had many words before age 2... probably 100 or so... and was combining them together right at 2. He used his language functionally without a problem at that age. BUT there were still some peculiarities in his language use and structure. For example he mixed up prounouns for a while. He tested on the low end of average with his first speech eval because of this. By the time he was 3 his speech was age appropriate with normal structure and flow. Now at 4.5 years of age he tests at an 8 year old level verbally.'

'Thanks for the info and replies. I didn\'t mention that dh has some problems reading.No doubt dyslexia although he\'s never been tested.(Our dd is dyslexia and CAPD and I tutored these kids for several years so I\'m not saying this without some knowledge) I have printed out a few short things for him to read that I hope will help him be a little more understanding. I think it would be easier for him to understand if W had a physical handicap and didn\'t appear normal to him.

Try to write down how you you want to handle it - maybe even make up an agenda and go over it with the therapist. Practice saying your \"speech\" over and over - even in front of the mirror. Unfortunately, you may not get past whatever your first sentence is - if they start interrupting. Hopefully, the therapist will be assertive enough (and you, too!) to intervene and make sure that everyone gets to have a say. Her job should be as a mediator - which means to keep people from saying awful things and to keep everyone on track of what the agenda is. You should be running the meeting though and saying what you want to say to them. The therapist should back you up, but it should come from you mostly. You are Trinity\'s mommy and that should be made clear from the get-go. Saying that it has been a hard year and you appreciate their help, but you feel that has led to things getting confusing for Trinity. She needs to be with her mommy full-time and understand that you are her caretaker and provide for her needs. And that you are fully capable of doing that. </P> <P>Don\'t back down whatever you do!</P> <P>Again, sending good thoughts and wishes your way!</P> <P>Edited to say: I forgot to ask - is this the therapist that is an intern? Depending on her experience (which I\'m guessing isn\'t much) and age, this might be difficult for her to do without a supervisor involved. I would hate to see this blow up in your face.

He pesters his siblings. He doesn\'t self-regulate at home, but he does well at school with their highly structured routines. Things like that. He\'s one of a kind.

So far they haven\'t agreed to any devices to help, but we are finally starting to have other staff the school has selected to work with him see the issues and speak up, so my fingers are crossed. In my son\'s case, the school just wants to believe my son as doing it deliberately. The other suggestion would be to have the child you work with dictate writing assignments or math answers etc to an aide and have the aide write for him which is what my son currently does with his tutor.</P> <P>Hope this helps</P>'

'<P>Here are a few things to help make the comparison:</P> <P> A child that is just speech delayed usually has more non verbal means of communicating than an autistic child. Eg shaking head for \"no\", waving \"bye bye\" without constant prompting and guiding, pointing to things to ask for them and to express an interest in them. A child on the spectrum is less likely to do these things.</P> <P>A child on the spectrum might be able to say words, but they may not use them for communication. They may say more words than a speech delayed child, but whereas the sd child might say things to ask for things and exchange information the autistic child is less likely to do so. I know a lot of autistic children develop some form of communication, so I\'m talking about younger children here for the most part (under fives).</P> <P> A child on the spectrum is often very good at doing some thing and has significant delays/differences in other areas. Eg Ds1 can put a puzzle together very precisely and carefully but can\'t jump properly yet. He can hold a pencil in quite a mature writing style but can only follow a few one step instructions.

He barely knew 10 words at 2 and was HYPERactive. I consider myself blessed because I do have 2 boys that I love so much regardless of what they are labelled.

He has good gross motor skills and has been walking since 12 months. He is being tested by EI on March 11th. We will look for a diagnosis when he is closer to 2 years old.

'<P>I have my own son on meds and most of my students are as well. Now.....I think when kids are younger under 6 you can really manage things environmentally. Tantrums etc are easier to handle. So I don\'t think meds should be a first choice for younger kids. HOWEVER, as kids with ASD get older and stronger meds are a good support.....THEY WILL NOT FIX BEHAVIOR. I look at the use of meds as a way to calm my son WHILE WE TEACH HIM APPROPRIATE BEHAVIORS AND RESPONSES. I get frustrated with my students parents who feel that giving meds is the answer. I think if you choose to give meds it needs to be part of a whole treatment plan. Also, you know your child and what your life is like and what you do is your choice.

'<P>Except for the fact that my son has not had to go to a residential facility, this could be my son. My son was dx\'d in preschool, though, and has gotten PLENTY of help. Still, it won\'t be enough. I wish I could be certain that this boy would be functioning in the world of work soon. It\'s not that likely. Autism issues are FAR less accepted in the workplace compared to simple lack of ability. My son is 16. He will also be 22 when he gets his IEP diploma (certificate of completion). I was at the graduation at his spec. ed. voc. ed. program Thurs. I had tears in my eyes for the 3 kids who were graduating. This is the end of a pretty happy part of their lives. Their futures are far from certain. And those three are simply mildly retarded, not autistic. I realized that I have only 5 more years of predictability. When Jamie turns 21, all bets are off. Yes, there may be something out there that will work for him, but his special ed rights will end. Getting him help in his adult life will require cooperation. I will no longer be able to demand anything. Yes, these next 5 years will teach him a lot. But not enough to be independent. He will be exactly like the young man in the article. I\'m sure graduation day was happy for that young man and his family. But they don\'t call it \"commencement\" for nothing. Kids are supposed to <U>commence </U>their adult lives. It\'s hard to see how this boy (or mine) will be able to do that the day after graduation. </P> <P>I am hoping we can get an update on the boy in this article a year from now.</P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by tzoya on June 09 2007 at 4:33pm</span>'

'<P>Scientists who are researching this have found several of what are probably many genetic markers for autism. Unlike some inherited disorders (DOwn Syndrome is a common one), autism is not carried on a single chromosome but several. There are currently guesses about how many have to match up to have autism as a result. It is not yet known if there needs to be an instigation for autism to kick in. Probably they will eventually find out there are several causes of autism, all genetically based, but some need environmental insults to kick in and some don\'t. They don\'t yet know that part, but they KNOW it\'s genetic. They can tell from identical twin studies. There is a 90% chance that if one twin has autism, the other does, too. That jives with other issues that have proven to be genetic and the percentage of time those are found in both twins. I can understand why knowing it\'s genetic can be comforting. None of us can control our genetic heritage, but we CAN control the environment our kids are exposed to. Or at least we THINK we can. Anyone who\'s been a parent for awhile KNOWS we really can\'t fully protect our kids from life anymore than we can protect them from their genes.</P>'

'<P>I haven\'t done RDI.. I have read RDI for Young Children which will give you an idea of what it\'s about. I\'d suggest reading the book. It\'s in the social pragmatic stream of interventions. </P> <P>Also in the social pragmatic stream is: \"More than Words\" by Fern Sussman if your child is nonverbal or just starting to interact with other children. It is also a great book to see how kids with ASD develop. The extension of \"More than Words\" is \"Talkability\" if your child is verbal and needs support in conversations and higher social interactions. Both of these use regular environment and provide practical easy to read how to info and produced by the <A href=\"http://www.hanen.org/web/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Hanen Speech Center</A>. I\'ve found these more comprehensive than the RDI book.</P> <P>Another one is <A href=\"http://www.scerts.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SCERTS</A> by Dr. Barry Prizant which takes a clinical appproach to social pragmatics and would allow use in schools and consistency across OT, ST, school, home etc. This great for pinpointing social pragmatic goals and provides supports the child needs to achieve them. It also focusses on mainstream or regular environment teaching and could be an extension of \"More than Words\" philosophy from home. </P> <P>I\'ve found that having multiple kids on the spectrum I don\'t have time for \"therapy sessions\" so these have allowed incorporation of goals into the daily routine. My kids have picked stuff quicker this way than using discrete trials and what they learn is functional to them so generalization isn\'t an issue. </P> <P>And of course Dr. Greenspan\'s Floortime..

'<P>I took Elliot to the park today with an NT friend - both of them almost 3, and there was another family there with boys about 3 &amp; 4. They were all sitting at a picnic table and my Elliot was wandering around the playground alone, so I pointed and said \"Look the boys are having a picnic. Do you want to go?\" and Elliot ran over there. He sat down at the table all excited and said \"Hi boy\" then a bunch of jibberish, which he has been doing a lot of lately when he seems to just want to socially talk. This other child then pointed at my son, laughed out loud at him and yelled \"Why\'s he talking like that?\" His mother, standing right there said nothing to her kid, but turned to me and asked, \"How old is he?\" which you know of course means like her son, \"Why is he talking like that?\" It just totally broke my heart. I cried the whole way home in the car. <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"> So far, Elliot\'s differences haven\'t been that noticeable because he\'s so little, and no one\'s ever suggested to me that he didn\'t seem \"normal\". As he\'s getting older his language especially is becoming more noticeably different from NT kids, and it breaks my heart that there\'s probably more of this to come. What do you say?

We had the same birthday and were the exact same age and were inseparable. I have always wondered what happened to her...</P> <P>I didn\'t have many friends after that because I skipped 1st grade and then we moved the first week of 3rd grade. I then went to a Catholic school in one town for the rest of that semester and transferred to the Catholic school in the town my parents bought our house in for the last semester. Needless to say, that wasn\'t exactly a year I made many friends! Although I did have some in the first Catholic school that I met up with years later in high school and we totally renewed our friendship!</P> <P>So, I guess what I\'m saying is that yes, girls are definitely different than boys in that respect. I know three year-olds who have \"best friends\" that they spend all their time with. But there are also girls who don\'t have many friends until much later on as well. </P> <P>Shelley, my only concern is that IF Sarah does encounter issues later on - if you let the diagnosis go completely - well, it is often hard to get back. Depends on the school, I guess. If you trust that the school will give her services if she shows issues that is one thing.

'well I think it is relaay just how they are tested and what age, and doctor, bobby at 12, when finally dignosed had PDD-AUTISM, last year it was PDD-NOS. Bobby is high funtioning, and the first diagnosis the Dr told us he was High Funtioning Autism but the written diagnosis on paper said PDD-Autism. Becouse he was so smart it was hard to get earlier diagnosis. he did then and still does have deficits in all areas, what he appears to DR now is due to our upbringing, he never got any therapy, it was never offered or known of by any of our so called therapists and counselors. SO ABA may help more but they can do well without it. We do the best we can with what we have. Too bad insurance is the difference with what one gets. each child is so different that you cant say one will do better or worse with one therapy. I feel we have done well so far. he is 23 driving, in college and getting more independent each year. he wont ever marry, may always need another to oversee his life, knows he could not live alone tomarrow if I died, he is not ready, does not have the skills yet, but he may someday. ther is always hope, never give up or accept what the DR says, he said bobby would only funtion in group home and maybe one of those work programs for the disabled. If we had accepted that we would not have pushed him to remain in regular school and normal expectations. he may fail but all kids fail sometimes and even normal ones dont get all their dream jobs, but he is trying and he may be the most educated stockboy you will ever find, or he may make it or we may be able to someday get disability for him. whatever, if you lower your expectations they will live down to them. PDD- NOS, AUTISTIC, ASBERGERS he doesnt really fit any yet has many of all their symptems, so where does he fit in, when they dont know you just get their best quess and we at least get a diagnosis that says we are not crazy, that others also see something different. dont get caught up if diagnosis label. at least at 12 we finally had a name for it, maynot have been exactly accurate then or now but it is better then nothing, when you and all who meet him know he is different.<div class=\'post_sig\'>- NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE, NEVER GIVE UP</div>'

'I think aides/therapists and interventionists sometimes loose sight of the <br />fact that they are here to assist US and our children so I make it very clear <br />to my interventionists that we will address behaviors that I WANT to <br />address and the only time they are to run the show or tell me what to do <br />is if we are currently working on one of those behaviors. If I don\'t want to <br />address a behavior and it is not interfering with my child\'s progress, then <br />they cannot force me. This doesn\'t mean I let my child run the show but it <br />means we systematically work on behaviors in a controlled setting and <br />then generalize them just like OurFamilyisHis. <br /> <br />I understand that if we are working on addressing a behavior such as <br />tolerating no and my child has a tantrum that I must follow through but I <br />would have to give permission to address this behavior first. Does that <br />make sense? Don\'t let your interventionist tell you what you have to work <br />on with your child. Or if you would like to address that behavior, let them <br />know that you would like to do at home first and then do it in public.

'I have a 2nd son about the same age as yours (20 months) and he does not put 2 words together yet. He is considered typical in speech, but has more words. The biggest thing I see that is different from my first is that he can point, follow a point and he understands directions (receptive). I think it would be wise to have someone (maybe a SLP) eval your son and keep and eye on him because you do have a higher chance of having another child with a developmental delay even if it isn\'t an ASD. I check in with my older sons therapists regarding my younger one and they suggest that a sibling be evaluated around 18 months.'

I think that was the night I decided I had enough. SO when we moved in I laid some ground rules. If he didn\'t meet them I would file immediately, get a restraining order (the kids were hiding under the table when he raged. VERY sad), and file for child support. I got my own room in the house and NO personal stuff between us (yes that meant sex or even hugging and so on). He had to get into treatment and continue AND see a therapist. NO verbal abuse (which he says he never did) and if he wanted to rage it went outside the house and me/kids. </p> <p>We are coexisting peacefully for the most part. He doesn\'t want the divorce but at this point, hey, that ship has SAILED. I am done. He\'s done really well in treatment-he is on a great med combo and his life is much better.

I married what i thought was \"the nice guy\". He was quiet, shy and so on but OMG I just had NO idea. And like one other said too, some problems I came in WITH, others were given to me. And support? Right...first, my family thinks the kids father is just insane. They think he is nice, but a little crazy. Then there is his family. Only in these last few months have I come to understand that his brother and his father are just down right manipulative, rude, and with a serious perception disorder. LOL...is there such a thing? Empathy from any of those three (including the kids father) is just not possible. I\'ve talked many times about how those two blame me for the suicide attempts and the marital problems. And then they talk about how the kids father was not nice to his brother growing up and how he is not always easy to get along with...yeah, you think? But they cannot see beyond themselves. I am convinced, now, after some ongoing events that baffle even me, that they are doing whatever they can to sabotage me. And you know what? I am not playing...<br><br>The good thing is that the kids father knows his family is not right, he encourages me to go on and leave (in a nice way) and to take my name back. He told his father not too long ago he was sorry he married me...if only because I had to put up with his brothers crap. It is so strange...I have never met people like these who think they have say so in what goes on in mine and the kids father\'s marriage...and I mean picking apart every detail that does not involve them. And when he speaks, they say I am prompting him. He, by all accounts, is invisable to them, and no matter what happens, it is my fault...well, if I were him I would be completely offended by that attitude, but he says is is numb to it...used to it. It\'s really sad. They are all trying to live the other\'s life...<br><br>Train wreck!<br><br>I will be happy to be away from them.<br><br><br>'

'I got my referral letter today approving Andrew for 19 office visits for occupational therapy. So my first thought was how long is an office visit cause we all know OT bills by minutes not visits, so i call tricare and what a joke that was. She says it doesn\'t matter how long the visit is, that is up to the provider. Well I understand that if we were talking about someone who charges by the visit like most drs do, but OTs don\'t, so how long of time are we talking about here. Well she says that is up to the provider. The OT told me she had 14 units on her sheet and a unit was 15 minutes. So if its 19 office visits and that means 19 units that\'s only 4.5 hours that isn\'t very much OT. So I asked tricare that and she said well if that\'s how they do it, so the provider gets to decide how long a unit is and bill tricare whatever they want? Made no sense to me.

'How much poop was there supposed to be? Is he claiming artwork on the wall, or a small streak? <br /> <br />I know with Jake, if he gets any on his finger or anything when he wipes, he\'ll just wipe it on the wall to get it off. Its not an all the time thing, just ocassionally, and we keep going through the other things he could do to get it off his hand (use toilet paper, wash hands with soap in sink, use baby wipe, etc). So its not like he intentional smears it to decorate or because he enjoys the feel (actually the opposite). <br /> <br />Could he have just wiped his finger off on the wall or something? If this guy, is claiming that there was a substantial amount on the wall, and he\'d never done this before, I\'d have to wonder. I would apologize, and make sure that you check the bathrooms after he goes for awhile to determine if this is a developing issue or not. It could possibly be that this guy is uncomfortable with kids with autism and is making that kind of statement because he wants to limit his interactions with him, and he thinks that autism = poop smearing. <br /> <br />Its hard to tell.

'Tzoya, I will probably write a post like yours 18 years from now. It describes my life and how I now feel now. I know years from now I will look back at my son\'s pictures, DVD\'s we made of him, and pages about him that I now fill in my scrapbook and realize I never truly enjoyed him for the beautiful child and sweet soul he is because I am obsessing and worrying about his current behavior and his future. <br /> <br />He is such a beautiful child, with large green eyes. Everywhere we go people comment about his appearance. Everywhere we go people tell us how bright he is. He\'s gentle with other children and with us. But so many days I stifle my own feeling of grief and I am so focused on getting answers to his behaviors and getting him help that I forget what an adorable, sweet boy I have. <br /> <br />I spent alot of years and money on my education but was never able to work in my field because of my son. <br /> <br />I lost my health. I have some health problems now as a result of not eating well, not sleeping well, just not taking care of my own health....because my son demands so much of me. <br /> <br />I lost some of my youthful optimism. I graduated and got married and was full of hope, excitement, and ambition for a \'typical\' life....and suddenly felt I was caught in a tidal wave and pushed out to rough seas. <br /> <br />Someone told me the Lord doesn\'t put a burden on us greater than we can bear. But I thought someone should talk to Him because this burden is sometimes more than I can bear. <br /> <br />I have lots of NT friends with NT kids. I have known them for years and know them intimately. They don\'t have the hardship raising three or four children as I have raising one child. And this is why I wanted \'typical\' NT children. I wanted raising children to be a little easier than it is for me. <br /> <br />But I try to remember the gift that God did give to me. Sometimes after my son is asleep I look at his baby pictures or sit around with my husband and tell him all the cute things he said or did that day. <br /> <br />I am traveling a hard road but it\'s not without its joys.'

'When a child is so young, there could be any number of reasons for a significant delay in development. Many physicians are loathe to say \"autism\" until some of these delays have had a chance to resolved themselves. In fact, it\'s not at all uncommon for an official Dx to have to wait until kindergarten age. In the meantime, the child should be getting intervention based on his observed and tested deficits. It really doesn\'t matter at this early stage what the medical dx is. However, if you are pursuing a medical dx, I would find out from the Autism Society of America who the go-to physician is for autism in your are. I would also wait until after the age of three, at least, to continue to pursue a dx. Many of even th experts want to wait. But don\'t wait TOO long. By 5 there should be enough evidence to warrant a diagnosis if there IS one.'

After a few weeks of waiting for an appointment. </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=4>Anyway, the orthorpedic doctor checked Emily and had her walk around the room to observe her. Well she said that the pain that Emiy was getting on her legs was because her muscles and tendons are not relaxed. She said to continue massaging her legs.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=4>She said she is putting her on braces to help her flex and relax those muscles. She said her toe-walking is due to her Autism. She told me that I have to take her down stairs to another department to get her feet cast for measurements.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=4>We went and they casted both of her feet. She didn\'t fuss. The bad thing about the braces is that she must wear them inside her shoes but we tried getting them in her shoes and they didn\'t fit which means that I must shop for orthopedic shoe to go with her braces.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=4>We have to wait about 2 weeks for her braces, they are being made in Washington. They will call me to take her in to put them on. They said she could use her regular shoe with these braces, but we tried the ones they had and they wouldn\'t go in her shoes.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=4>They also said that I have to take her back in 4 month to see how she is doing with the braces and also every 18 months to get new ones. Lucky for me the insurance pays for this. To expensive, if you know what I mean.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=4>Then while they were casting her feet, we were picking a design for the straps and cushion. We decided on Hot pink straps and a puzzle design, kind of like the Autism design. Also purple for the cushion, So modern.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=4>She must wear the braces to sleep every night and 2-3 hours during the day to start, then leave them on all day. Wish us luck. I know this is going to be a problem. If the braces don\'t work, then we go to something else, botox/surgery to relax the muscles.

'<P>That is very true. You can\'t even mention the other child\'s name or even the child\'s mother\'s name. It is considered a privacy issue. Maybe the only thing you can suggest is that something is done with the other child regarding the behaviour. Also keep in mind there is the thin line of stepping on the other mom\'s parental responsibility. Maybe you could switch your child to another classroom. As far as hitting back, alot of schools have a no bullying policy now and that might get your own kid in trouble more than the other kid. Unfortunately most schools don\'t deal with the behaviour, they just redirect it. I know it is frustrating, believe me I do. Gabe\'s first three schools let him run the program because they wouldn\'t deal with the behaviour. And also keep in mind there is school policies on discipline and how far a teacher can actually go and each district and each state varies on that.</P> <P>Tammy</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>-  Mom to Jeffrey,16,autism, pdd-nos,adhd,add, ocd associated with autism; and Gabe,13,chronic asthma,overall global delays, hearing processing delay, severe allergies, pdd-nos.</div>'

'<P>Just a note on the issue of acquiring social skills...it\'s a matter of generalization. A child who learns that skill in a particular environment/setting (i.e., greets students only in the classroom) has <strong>not</strong> generalized that skill into all environments, and therefore has not mastered that skill. Skills must be generalized across all settings - classroom, general population, home - to be considered mastered.</P> <P><strong>Functional</strong> skills, including self-care and social skills, are required to be addressed by the school district in an IEP. The argument that they address <strong>academics</strong> <strong>only</strong> is one school administrators will use on a regular basis, but it is not in compliance with IDEA.</P> <P>You also mentioned \"low volume\" - that is something that needs to be addressed in speech/language.

'<P>We had our PPT meeting Monday which actually went pretty well (I didn\'t even cry this time). The new autism specialist we\'ve been seeing was there. He presented a plan to the school about my son. One of his recommendations was this: \"Given the nature of our concerns, it is recommended that an outside integrated program utilizing cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) approach would be beneficial and should be done in conjunction with any social skills training\". Does anyone know what this is?</P> <P>His other recommendation was this:</P> <P>\"At this time, Presley\'s educational team needs to examine both his current academic performance and what is truly his least restrictive environment. Interventions should be put in place outside the realm of Special Education to ensure Presley has both academic and social success. If these interventions do not have the outcome expected, Presley\'s eduational team should make a referral to Special Education.\"</P> <P>Then he went on to say that if this doesn\'t work they will need to have a full neuro-psychological evaluation.</P> <P>The specialist seems to feel that the reason my son doesn\'t have any behavior problems or breakdowns in school and only at home is because he feels more comfortable at home to do these things. This is why they don\'t see what we do. He had observed Presley in class one day and noticed his stims and tics (which the school psychologist has doubted completely). He noticed his anxiety and how he has serious social problems. They even noted some tics he does in school that he doesn\'t do at him which surprised me. They said he puts his fingers in his mouth and bit his hands. Why has the teacher never told me about this?</P> <P>I shouldn\'t be happy that my son did all of this in class, but I am happy that the specialist the school chose is the one who saw it all. The school will go by whatever recommendations he gives. I think we are finally going to get Presley the help he needs. It only took about 2 years for someone else to believe me.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS 4-98 HFA or Asperger\'s  DD 9-01 NT (has febrile seizures)</div>'

'oh, I feel your pain - that would drive me mental in about three days! <br /> <br />Your son is adorable, but man that\'s shrill! Donny used to be a huge <br />screamer too, but his were more tantrum related than a stim. <br /> <br />What comes to mind reading your post and watching the video is that you <br />need some sort of targeted plan to eliminate that behaviour. <br /> <br />There\'s a few things to think about. <br /> <br />First off, why do you think he screams? Do you think he likes the sound, <br />or the feeling of pushing air out fast through his throat? Both are <br />sensory, it\'s just a matter of figuring out which one. <br /> <br />The first thing I\'d do, is introduce an alternate behaviour that fills the <br />same function. If it\'s the air pushing he likes, blowing hard and fast into <br />a balloon, or even just teaching him to do it with no balloon, through <br />modelling, if he\'ll copy, should replace that. If it\'s the sound, get a <br />recording of high squealing noises (think dolphin music, tropical birds, <br />etc.), a sturdy kids music player, and some sturdy headphones which <br />cover the whole ear (better tolerated than the ear bud type). Every time <br />he screams, redirect him to one of those activities (sitting with the <br />headphones on, or blowing). See which one he seems to like better. <br />Keep track of how often he screams after listening to the dolphin music vs <br />after blowing. If he screams less after the music, then the screaming is <br />for the noise. If he screams less after the blowing, it\'s for the air pressure <br />feeling. <br /> <br />Once you\'ve figured out the function, you\'ll want to put him on a sensory <br />diet for this, which means giving him that input on a schedule. <br /> <br />Once he\'s on a schedule, you\'ll want to put together a reinforcement <br />system. <br /> <br />Figure out how long he typically goes without screaming. Find something <br />tangible (tickles, stickers, candies, whatever) that he REALLY likes. Say he <br />usually goes 4 minutes between screams. Start by rewarding him every 3 <br />1/2 minutes that he goes without screaming. Gradually increase the <br />time, working up to him having to go 5 minutes without screaming, then <br />up to 10, then up to 20, etc. As you increase the time he has to go <br />without screaming to earn the reward, increase the size of the reward <br />also. Make sure to also reward him any time that he spontaneously, <br />rather than screaming, goes to his alternate activity (blowing or listening). <br /> <br />It will be a lot of work, but WILL work, and be totally worthwhile. <br /> <br />I hope this makes sense? If you need me to clarify, just say so!<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Donny 13 - classic autism, bipolar</div>'

Before, I went to go get him I decided to go to GNC and by some supplements. I was determined to try a whole different approach. I purchased a liquid form and a capsule form. The liquid is full of vitamins and minerals and amino acids. The capsule is fish oil,essential for the brain. His is still on medication,strattera,addarax,and clonidine- but I can tell you - his is so much better since he\'s been off the antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. Yes, he is still hyper, but not as aggressive. He missed a dosage of his supplements and he did act out some,but no where near like before. I have seen a change in him, with the supplements and now know he can\'t be without them. Eventually, I will have him off of all meds. Tonight, I put him in respite and he\'ll be there for a week.

They sent a BCBA to our house to consult us and evaluate my daughter and come up with a program. We live too far away for them to do in-home therapy.</P> <P>Because we aren\'t seeing any progress with our daughter we decided we would get an apartment in the provider\'s area and I would take our daughter and the baby to the apartment 3 days out of the week to get services by a professional therapist.

'Sorry I dont have any advise. My son is 4 in a couple of days and not potty trained. I know a couple of parents with asd children who did potty train early. Probably using pecs, Collin has never really used those very well. He is pretty verbal now but I think his sensory issues are impeding him from being able to control his potty issues. I would say give it a try using pecs with some sort of reinforcer that he really loves, but if it doesnt work give it a break. Just dont push it to hard other wise he will get discouraged. But I say it never hurts to try.'

'<P>I know my ds regressed not because of vaxes because he didn\'t get them... just before 2; my guess it was a shift (step)in development that he couldn\'t get over and needed some extra tools... he began stimming: piling and unpiling clothes staring out the window at school etc. For him the biggest help was visual-text support.. it got him up on the step and moving forward again with language. </P> <P>I think there are times when kids brain\'s change like shifting into the next gear and kids with ASD have difficulty figuring out the path and dealing with the change in their brain.

When they look at juice in a glass, they think that they have more to drink when the juice is poured from a wide glass into a narrow one. The children focus on the height of the juice and ignore the change in width. When they look at a model of three mountains, Intuitive-Phase children assert that their current view would be unchanged if they looked at the model from another position (Inhelder &amp; Piaget, 1967). They will also say that another child would have the same view as theirs if that child looked at the model from another position.

'<P>I think it could be anywhere on the spectrum. Are you concerned about your 19 month old? Sometimes it is too soon to tell - but usually you are noticing minor signs by then. Does he have any delays in terms of speaking or gross/fine motor skills? Does he look at you when you call his name? Does he point at things and try to get you to look at them? Is he doing any pretend play yet? These are all things an NT child should be doing by that age. </P> <P>This is not a silly question that you ask AT ALL. You are smart to think ahead and prepare. It\'s not a decision to rush into lightly and there have been many threads on this. A lot of us have different feeling on having more children and reasons why or why not. </P> <P>I don\'t think you have to give up hopes of a third child, but I might wait until your youngest is at least 2 to get a better idea of whether or not he might be on the spectrum. If you have two kids on the spectrum, that significantly increases your chances of having a third one on the spectrum. And that might change your mind about whether or not you want a third child. And I don\'t necessarily mean because three kids on the spectrum would be challenging to handle emotionally. But you have to figure in finances as well - and plan for their futures when you are gone. If you can afford to make sure that all three kids are provided for for the rest of their lives (in case they cannot live totally independently), then that is fine. Most of us will have a hard time doing that and it is a worry.

'I do ignore tantrums but I also think it is important in addition to ignoring to teach him an appropriate way to get your attention. That way he understands that communication is powerful - but that it just has to be the right kind of communication. When Aidan used to scream to get my attention, I first taught him a way to ask in a quiet voice (if your child is non verbal perhaps you could use a sign) and then gave him attention immediately. Then I started teaching him about waiting - I would count while saying wait. First just to 5 followed by lots of \"nice waiting\" praise and then I worked my way up so he gradually understood the idea that wait did not = no and now if I say wait he knows I will get to him in a short while.'
'I would call a psychologist if meds are absolutely out of the question because they cant prescribe medication but if not i would start with her Neurologist since he is already familiar with her. The thing i like about my sons Neurologist is that he deals not only with seizures but these kinds of things as well (some Neuros like to only deal with seizures it seems when they should be dealing with alot more issues really). But sometimes behavior can be affected by unseen seizures so since my son has a history of them i like dealing with the neuro (and HIS psych is really quick to hand out meds in an instant which is what i dont like).<br>Good luck and keep us updated (((hugs)))<br>ETA: Also i just had a thought. My son is off prozac now but he may need to go back on when school starts (his Neuro and I have already talked about it) because his behaviors are worse during school time (hes more relaxed during summer even with all the changes and issues were going thru right now). So maybe it is also being worsened by school? Even after school his rigidity was thru the roof! He also would get real mad when we sat on the wrong couch, gave him the wrong cup to drink from, opened the door too soon and everything in between.

The screaming got so bad my son was trying frantically to get out of the car, that I turned to my sister in law and said this could not continue and I yelled at the child to quit it.

However, he had always been content to sit on laps and observe-not very active as a baby, with the exception of vigorously moving his tiny arms up and down, in synch, from a very early age. He was also fascinated with manipulating his tiny fingers and objects from early on, say 3 months.

But the child can actually read random words from books I have never taught him. Unlike you though I have been told yes by teachers(in Fl) and therapists because of this refusal to cooperate with tasks but no by dev pedis and neurologists because of the eye contact, his connection to me and his siblings, and he completely cooperates with them at these dr visits. Does everything he can understand, smiles at them, looks for their reaction/approval, and totally interacts with them. The school doesn\'t believe me. LOL! The drs always tell me delayed yes, autistic absolutely not. I think because mommy is there and he is comfortable, and while we are there he doesn\'t do any stimming, he does at home and school though. I was also told no by the DC school psych too, but then I learned that their SD does not know what to do with high functioning autism, they have to be severly effected before they will qualify them for an autistic class. Everyone ends up getting an advocate there. I really believe they are both somewhere on the line. For aspergers I was told by the dev pedi that they present behind in some areas, usually social, but are advanced in cognitive areas and speech. My boys are pretty equally delayed acroos the board so that ruled out aspergers. Remember that teachers and school psychs are not doctors, they can only diagnose for school purposes, its not a medical diagnosis. You need an MD for that. I\'m sure others will have great advice as how to handle the school.

'One of my GF at work said she wouldn\'t put the DX in there. She thought it may just confuse people.

'Hi! I am new to this forum and I hope I\'m posting in the right place. My name is Suzanne and I have an almost 4 year old daughter, Janey, who was diagnosed with autism last December. It\'s taken me until about now to accept this. One of the reasons for this is that I\'ve been in this place before! I have 2 sons also, William, who is almost 14 and Freddy, almost 11. William was diagnosed as autism at age 2, as having Aspergers at age 4, and then from age 8 on having nothing (being fairly Neurotypical I guess you call it) This isn\'t a result of us \"curing\" him or any major interventions, and I think the original diagnosis was incorrect. He was a preemie (born at 31 weeks, weighing 3.5 pounds) and I think it just took him a while to catch up. Anyway, I guess when Janey started showing signs that should have been a red flag, I wasn\'t ready to admit what had become obvious to many others for a while.<br><br>Janey is a wonderful girl! However, she is tough! She is verbal in her own way (mainly delayed echolalia type talking, or set phrases, but she has a lot of them). She is quite musical and knows 100s of songs, but often gets \"stuck\" on one and sings it until she is crying not to sing it and can\'t stop. She has the lovely habit of reaching in her diapers and covering herself with the contents, which is becoming more and more of a problem. Sleep is also tough lately-she seems to have about a 2 hour period in the middle of the night where she is wide awake and wants to play.<br><br>I really would love to connect to other mothers of autistic younger girls.

'<P>Jennifer ... I don\'t really suspect COS, however I suppose I can\'t rule it out. Actually I was leaning more towards bipolar disorder. My son has what I would consider manic phases, usually first thing in the morning when most kids are still struggling with waking up. He finds everything funny, can\'t sit still, jumps, hollers, sings and makes odd noises. He seems incapable of reigning it in. I struggle to get him ready for school most days. If a fight arises out of one of these episodes, it is violent, loud and lengthy. Recently he\'s begun to tell me that he is sad. School reports that he seems unhappy and anxiety ridden while there ... he has begun to act out there as well. They said it seems to take every bit of control he possesses to get through the day without reacting to all of the sensory challenges. Anyone have any ideas?

The more like a bunch of roommates sharing expenses/responsibilities and the less like an institution the better. He is VERY social and I think he\'d enjoy sharing a house with others.</P> <P>I also will be \"shopping\" for a supervisory organization that has very liberal ideas of what can work for an adult and one that treats him, to the greatest extent possible, like an adult. My ultimate dream for him (tho I really don\'t have any clue whether or not this dream will come true) is that he will find someone to love and have a close emotional AND physical relationship with, so I want an organization that approves of sex. I will not riest in peace if I think my son will never be hugged again or will never be intimate. I certainly don\'t want to force the issue, but I know that some organizations actively discourage romantic relationship. I don\'t want that to happen for my son. I am fine with whatever sexual choice he makes or even if he doesn\'t want sex. I just don\'t want OTHERS (except his partner, of course) to make that decision for him.

'<P><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>I\'ve read all these posts with tears of encouragement, sadness and empathy... my son Ian-16 was just diagnosed with High Functioning Autism three weeks ago. Dx\'d PDD/NOS as a preschooler, we were told that when they got his speech \"working\' after two years of special ed and he wasn\'t drooling or crying everytime they went outside that he was now \'fine\' and ready to mainstream. As this occured right as we moved to a new city and switched to homeschooling, we never realized what PDD/NOS meant... until now. It breaks my heart to realize what we could have, would have or should have been doing had we known. A few years ago I ran across an article about a new field of research known as \"Aspergers\"...my heart lept, it sounded like our special little \"geek\" of a cherub ...except for the delayed speech. This led to further research and a personal dx of HFA agreed upon by our pediatrician. She didn\'t think it was necessary to pursue an offical dx since Ian was then doing fine in school (since we were instinctively adapting to his strengths and weaknesses) - and then came the day when our math genius announced that he hated math and was bad at it. What was he talking about? In third grade he passed a test at eigth grade level because I answered a seemingly harmless question about how to do a math problem he\'d seen at the end (eighth grade section) of the test... he extrapolated that info to help him pass all the other sections! But now he was \"bad\" at it... first he appeared to struggle, then stall and he has regressed for the last year back down to fourth grade level. The diagnosing psychologist explained that Ian has a lot of trouble holding multiple pieces of data (IE: numbers) in his head, manipulating them and then outputting... AHA! That explained so much... </FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>So that devastating day when we drove the six hours home from the UW Autism Center trying to sound as happy and positive as Ian was (he was THRILLED to have an explaination for others) and crying inside about the finality of the dx we had \"known\" for two years... Ian announced, \"Hey, there\'s another pattern on my watch!\" \"What kind of pattern?\", I asked. \"It says, \'616\' and that\'s a pattern\" he replied matter of factly. Skeptically I asked, \"so it\'s a pattern because of the sixes on either side?\", \"Yes\", \"Well, what if it was a 2 or 3 in the middle?\" \"Then those would be patterns too.\" \"Why?\" \"Because they all go into 6.\" My husband\'s face lit up as he drove through the rain... \"Ian! Those are all common denominators!\" \"What would the numbers in the middle be if they were 8\'s on either side?\" I countered... \"Um, 1,2 and 4\" \"Ian!\" I cried, \"Those are common denominators too!\" \"Wow!\" Ian exclaimed... \"so that\'s how that works...\" My tears lifted for the moment just knowing that we might finally get beyond being \"bad at math.\"</FONT></P>'

She can fool anyone into thinking ADHD - her ped. swears by ADHD but after reading this book, I KNOW its sensory.

'Yes, there are several red flags. In addition to being evaluated by a dev. ped., he should also have full evaluations by the school district. Did they just observe him, or did they do standardized testing? It sounds like he could be getting services from the school (speech, OT, PT at the least). <br /> <br />As per Wright\'s Law, you can request evaluations be performed to find out if he qualifies for special education services. A good book to read is \"From Emotions to Advocacy\". From your list, I would have him evaluation for fine motor, gross motor, speech, adapative, cognitive, academic. <br /> <br />By the way, my dd also sight reads way above grade level, but her comprehension does not match. This is fairly common with ASD kids. <br /> <br />My son, who has Asperger\'s, was not diagnosed until kindergarten also. Although he had started private occupational therapy while in preschool, he did not have an IEP until a few months into kindergarten. Earlier is better of course, but he has made great progress with private and school therapies. So, I would recommend getting your son evaluated as soon as possible. <br /> <br />Best wishes. <br /> <br />- <br /> <br />mom to 10 year old boy/girl twins (Asperger\'s/PDD-NOS) <br /> <br /> <br /><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by mbmom on December 12 2009 at 4:11pm</span>'

'<P>Hello everyone!!</P> <P>My name is Preston and I live in San Jose, California, which is about 50 miles south of San Francisco. I am 30 years old, but I sure don\'t act my age. I was diagnosed as having high functioning autism when I was 26. Through all the years I was in high school and in college, everyone thought that I had it, including my high school psychologist. No one ever told my parents about it though. I feel that if I had been diagnosed earlier and therapy was started when I was, say, maybe 3 or 4 years old, then my autism might not be as bad as it is now. I have a BA degree in Geography from a university in California, and I am like a walking atlas - I could tell you how to get ANYWHERE virtually. I love collecting road maps (I have like 700 maps probably), street detail level maps. Of course, a lot of autistic people have special talents, perhaps savantlike. I am no exception. You could give me the title of any oldies song, and I could tell you who sang it, what year it was, what record label and number it was on, etc. I never was in GATE (gifted and talented ed) so I know I\'m not functioning at a genius level or anything, I was tested 3 times in elementary school. At first it was thought that I might actually have Asperger Syndrome, but most people with Asperger\'s are geniuses, and plus, they also talk at a normal age. I did not talk till I was 4 years old. I just have high functioning autism. So much as for high functioning.....I can\'t even hold a job. Finding a job is very hard for me, and keeping it is even harder. <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\"></P> <P>One of the things that has really bothered me over the years is that I still have a pacifier that I suck on. Have any of you parents out there have children that have used a pacifier (bippy) for a long long time, like 10 years?? <U><strong>Do I have this problem with the passie because of the fact that I am autistic?</strong></U> I am certainly beginning to suspect so. I have heard numerous reports of autistic people who have some sort of oral fixation. I had a bottle till I was 6 years old (and I wasn\'t using it because of sibling rivalry - some kids will revert to being like a \"baby\" if there is a new child in the house, I only used it because I loved it), and the sucking stim never left me, and I ended up getting a pacifier in my early years in high school. I thought that a pacifier would be better because a bottle could be hard to hide from my parents. I started off with the Gerber Nuk, then I switched over to the Cherubs pacifier (now extinct), and finally ended up with the Ulti Mam pacifier in college. Basically, the pacifier has been a part of my life since I was 15 years old, and if you combine the years I have had a pacifier with the years that I used a bottle, I\'ve had some sort of oral fixation crutch for more than 21 years. I haven\'t met many autistic people that are chronic pacifier users, but then on the other hand, I don\'t <strong>know</strong> that many people personally who do have autism. <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley2.gif\" border=\"0\"></P> <P>The problem with passie too is that I will take it everywhere I go virtually. I suppose it\'s kind of a security object for me too. Like I will take it to school even. I went to college away from home this past year and also from 1998-2000, and I sometimes (as well as when I was in junior college) took my pacifier with me to class. Usually it just remained in my shirt pocket or whatever. I suppose just knowing that it was near, that I could feel it, was enough for me. I usually did not take it out. When I go on long trips (including to places out of state), I always take my pacifiers with me. I wonder sometimes what my pacifiers are doing to my teeth. Usually it\'s only a nighttime thing, but sometimes like I said, I will bring it to school with me. I\'m not going to college now, trying to find a job as a map editor/proofreader from home. I\'m very good at catching mistakes in road maps and that sort of stuff. Anyway, I just take my pacifier anywhere I go. I should have had stock in the company that makes the Mam pacifier. I\'ve been a loyal customer for more than a decade. I suspect most of their customers aren\'t their customers for that long. Sassy Baby Products distributes the Mam pacifier in this country; they are actually made in Austria. Will this pacifier cause me problems with my teeth? I have tried to get rid of it twice, but no matter how hard I tried it didn\'t work. I can truly empathize with any toddler or preschooler that is having a hard time (I\'ve seen kids as old as 4 with pacifiers in public, like at supermarkets or Costco, etc) trying to give up his/her pacifier because it is VERY hard. And the older you get, from what I hear, the harder it is to give up. It is much easier to give it up when you are 15 months old than when you are 4 years old. My teeth formation might be changing. Is sucking a stim?? Do autistic people have stims like that??</P> <P>I also find myself totally behaving like a toddler without any warning. I have a few friends that are my age (most of my friends are either like toddlers/preschoolers, or they are elderly people over age 65, which I hear is typical of people with Asperger\'s as well as high functioning autism) who seem to think too that I am just an overgrown superannuated toddler. I mean, my friends that I do have that are my age seem to think that I am younger than them, even though they might be 21 and I might be 30. I feel this way myself too. I never really did act my age. I don\'t think it\'s because I don\'t want to act my age. I think it is not even controllable - I mean, without warning I will just be like a toddler. I look at the world from the viewpoint of a toddler. Not to say that every way a toddler views the world is \"immature\". I know lots of toddlers that are much more friendlier, caring, understanding, warmhearted, and nonracist than a lot of adults that I know. I carefully select my adult friends. But like I will act like a toddler, I mean, for example, I will go to the supermarket and play with candy or something like that. I will talk and talk and talk and distract people from what they are doing. And on and on and on. I never watch anything but kids shows either for most of the time. If I do watch TV, more or less it will be Teletubbies, Sesame Street, Barney, that sort of stuff. Maybe Care Bears. I think I have OCD too as well as ADHD because when I get myself interested in something, I really go far deep into it....it\'s like an obsession. I collect everything that is Teletubbies (I have Teletubbies backpacks, a carry-on bag, bedsheets, CDs, and just about anything Teletubbies except for a sleeping bag and a Teletubbies dish/bowl). I\'m about the biggest Teletubbies fan there ever was. I love Care Bears a lot too, same old thing. I have Care Bears backpacks, umbrella, CDs, placemats, and so on. Somehow, the interesting thing is that most toddlers seem to view me as a bigger species of toddler, like they seem to see a part of themselves in me. I get as much respect from them as I give to them. </P> <P>Why am I acting so immaturely? Do people with autism generally don\'t act their age?? I notice that I\'m like a toddler. I\'m about the closest you could get to being like a toddler without being one in reality. I actually notice I\'m like a toddler because people tell me, but yet, I act like one without even knowing. I even play with baby toys sometimes. Some of my friends in junior high school when they bumped into me 2 years later when I was in high school, they told me I did not change at all, still the same old Preston. My 9th grade teacher wrote that I have the social skills and behavior of an average 7 year old. Not that I was disruptive in her class - I was actually a great student who was no problem. She gave a lot of the class referrals for misbehavior but I never got one from her. But she felt that I was like a 7 year old. I just feel like I am not growing up, like I\'m some sort of real Peter Pan or something. </P> <P>Anyone know anything about this??? <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley5.gif\" border=\"0\"> Please respond. I hope you all realize I am not kidding when I say I have a pacifier and I am 30. I feel like I\'m 2 though. In a way, I am 30 and 12 and 2 simultaneously.</P> <P>There is another thing that I do that is like what 4 year olds will do - I TALK A LOT!!! That is unusual for autistic people to talk a lot. A lot of autistic people are cold, aloof, and nontalkative. My psychiatrist was wondering about this too. My psychiatrist also told me that I should really rid myself of the pacifier, but it\'s not her pacifier, that\'s easier said than done, just like the song by the Essex from 1963 \"Easier Said Than Done\". </P> <P>I do not take any medication, except for Zyprexa, which calms me down. I notice if I don\'t take it, then I wake up at an earlier time like around 8 am, but then I\'ll vomit because I\'ll have lots of acid in my stomach. With the drug, I sleep till 11 am, but at least I don\'t vomit the whole day. The drug is actually for bipolar disorder which I don\'t have, but it keeps me calm too, because otherwise if I don\'t take it and see children getting killed and people hurting each other and killing each other on the nightly news, I go nuts. I also talk much less when I take the medication. </P> <P>Thanks for any responses and have a great week</P> <P>Warm regards, </P> <P>Preston from San Jose, CA, United States Of America <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley4.gif\" border=\"0\"></P>'

'Hi Danielle, My 11 yr old NT has been having lots of behavioral issues at home lately. She has been really raging, trying to get physical with her younger brother(middle one) and being very disrepectful. I have not had a lot of problems with her in the past. She also does really well in school and has been put in alot of advanced classes. I had a talk with her teacher last week and she said that maybe the pressures of school were getting so much bigger and to hold it together there was all she could do. That letting loose where she knows she is safe is her coping mechanism. Said I shouldn\'t worry about it. Well, I think what she says may be true, on the other hand I don\'t think I can just let it go. I am trying to get a referral for her to see someone about her frustrations. She is very hot and cold with me now, as most preteen girls are, so I think she may need to talk with someone else. Anyway, it sounds like your son maybe has the pressure build up all day in school as well. It sounds like you are on the right track. Good luck to you. I also wanted to add that the other night, for the first time she said to me \"all you do is pay attention to Ethan\" (my youngest autistic one) I guess sometimes I forget how his issues affect the other kids. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- jan mom/grandma to dd 15 ds 12  ds 7 dx autism and grown up kids 33 and 31</div>'

'Do any of you have experience with this sort of Stim- <br />Our son does visual stimming or eye tracking.

'Julian just started some great imaginative play recently. He got his teddy bears together and was talking TO them as if he were a waiter and brought them pretend food on plates and cups and fed them. It was very cute! His obsessions were and still are at times, hot wheels. In fact, all modes of transportation fascinate him. Especially busses. I was told this was normal for ASD kids. To focus on something specific and obsess at times. We will redirect him if it gets to involved, but it is a kind of stimming, so if he is stressed, we just let it go. It is his way of relaxing after a hard day.'

'I think it\'s important to look for oddity. By that I mean, things that your child does that are really DIFFERENT for a child that age. And, yes, that includes talking TOO much. This could easily be a sign of Asperger\'s. But simply leading you around is not what they\'re talking about. It\'s ODD leading. As I mentioned earlier, my son would take my hand and literally THROW it toward the thing he wanted, instead of simply pointing. If a child is verbal but instead of saying \"open\" he puts your hand on the jar, that is odd. Of course, it\'s hard to say what\'s odd and what isn\'t unless we\'re THERE. But I think YOU know what your child is doing that\'s odd. Go to the CDC list but also take your child into situations where there are a lot of kids just his age. The playground, McDonald\'s, birthday parties. Observe him and try to make note of ANYTHING, good or bad, that seems out of the range of what \"normal\" kids do. At age 2, if you still have concerns, take him to the autism doc and get an eval.'

DH and I will read through this information again to see what we\'ve missed...it\'s been a while since we originally stumbled over this info.<br> <br> MomtoMatthew, I totally agree with you. Right now, it\'s a total dollars and cents thing with getting services. The budget for services has remained flat for several years, despite the fact that more kids are entering the system. We know this because we\'ve contacted our state representative about this.<br> <br> Also, much of the information we have comes from our private OT. She\'s contracted by our county to do evaluations on kids from birth-3. There are no free advocates in the area that I know of (that are taking new clients). She did give me the name of an *affordable* one...that\'s relative to what the SE lawyers charge.<br> <br> Finally, our county is testing the heck out of the kids to demonstrate that they don\'t need services/fit the criterion for services. I know that we\'re entitled to an independent eval. However, either the personal time and/or money needed to get to that point is terrible. Sad to say, I agree with another posted that it\'s easier to just pay for services than to fight to get current ones...knowing that my son won\'t be serviced by the intermediate unit once he hits kindergarten.<br> <br> Seriously, I don\'t think anyone should have to go through this...<br> <br> <br>'

'Does he have speech therapy? Has he been checked for apraxia? This means his mouth muscles simply cannot yet form words. Insisting on verbalizing can actually delay the ability to communicate. The name of the game is COMMUNICATION, not speech. Speech will probably eventually come. But it\'s vital to teach COMMUNICATION SKILLS at this point. Research has shown that PECS works very, very well for ASD kids. What you are doing now can be done with PECS. You teach your child to choose a PECS icon and hand it to you in order to get what he wants. Some kids need actual photos instead of PECS icons. But the idea is to exchange a form of communication for what he wants to get. Handing you the appropriate picture is going to be far easier for your child than producing the right sound. So he\'ll experience success more easily and more often. The same result can happen using sign language, but the problem with sign language is that few people understand it whereas everyone can understand a picture. Search here and on the Web for more PECS info. Of course, corner your child\'s speech therapist about it. If the speech therapist is unfamiliar with PECS, you\'ve got the WRONG speech therapist.'

I feel like my sons so called \"early intervention\" was just \"early specialized education\" the kind the regular pre-schools SHOULD give your children but don\'t. Instead regular preschools are more of a glorified play group. My child\'s vocabulary went from his own babble language that he understood to becoming more clearer for us to understand just in the last 4 months. Seems to be alot of that going on if you notice, a big language jump in age 4. Do I think my son has \"recovered\" because he is using words to communicate more and more, he doesn\'t flap as much? No. I just think he\'s getting older. Autism is not a dirty word in our house, nor is it an affliction or disease that my son \"suffers\" from. However I understand why many parents would see this as such, if there child Autism is very severe. Autism is what it is.......and it will always be a part of your child, it may change its from and grow with your child but it will always be there. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- juls35inva  mom to A(5)PDD,J(14) ADHD  \"AUTISM IS NOT A DISABILITY, ITS A DIFFERENT WAY OF BEING\"</div>'

'I haven\'t posted much on here before, but a few weeks ago I post about keeping our appointment with the Developmental Pediatrician for our 3 year old son; after a lot of feedback for you all we kept our appointment and had it today. We met with the Pediatrician, a Speech-Language Pathologist and Social Worker. The Pediatrician spoke mostly to the adults (me, DH, and my mom) while the Speech-Language Pathologist worked with J. He did really good on the language/verbal stuff, which we expected. The SLP also did some sort of screening for fine &amp; gross motor and self help - all those areas showed delays. In early April J is going to have a formal evaluation with an Occupational Therapist; 2 weeks after that we go back to see the Developmental Pediatrician for a meeting without J to discuss findings. Before we left today the Developmental Pediatrician said that <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Classic </span>Autism is ruled out (she seemed to stress the \"Classic\" part), we weren\'t at all surprised that Classic Autism was ruled out. She did ask if we\'ve done research and what WE thought. I let her know that we\'ve been wondering about Asperger\'s Syndrome, she didn\'t dispute that for a second. She started asking my husband and me about traits in US (social for him and anxiety in me). She also pointed out some \"oddities\" in J\'s use of language - an example of a sentence he used there: \"The red crayon would be perfect\". We\'ve heard plenty of similar things like that out of him - \"There go the children\" was one we heard a few weeks back when visiting family.<br><br>I did just have a few more questions...<br><br>1. When we were in the waiting room, another child (without an adult) came from the office and was in the waiting room the whole time we waited (about a half hour).

'My DS is 5 1/2 and his behavior has been the same since he was diagnosed around 2 1/2 yrs old. I don\'t know what it is but i think something besides PDD. His dev pedi thinks it might be ADHD. He turns his moods off and on quickly and is very sweet and overdoes it around people that he doesnt know and wanting all the attention to himself, if he doesnt get the attention he throws himself on the floor or tantrums still to this day. He can\'t be told anything by me or anyone, he gives me mean looks and i dont show him it bothers me and i try but sometimes i do show it bothers me cause it gets to me after all these years. If i ignore the behavior he still is this way. He lately tells his sister to do things that i asked her not to do and it happens alot. She is on the spectrum and for instance if she wants to go in the grocery cart and we were trying to get her to walk outside along the cart he will remind her about going in the cart then she starts insisting about going in and starts having behaviors. There is a bunch of this and hes very observant of people he would rather watch people all day instead of playing. He watches everything i do and how people react. We were out with family to a park and we got fries at the park and hes demanding to family of food he would eat all day and so my mil got him fries. My sil asked him if she could have a fry and he said no and threw them all over the park bench and ate them by himself. So my sil\'s boyfriend bought fries for my sil and my son got up and demanded he got some of their fries and they said no because he didnt share then he started freaking out and was grabbing at their fries and knocking them out of my sil\"s boyfriends hands. I love him with all my heart and he could be very sweet but also the house is being disrupted by all this and i just feel like crying i have been consistant and nothing seems to work. He doesnt mind timeout either..I dont know what to do anymore for him..he is always right in his mind, he is the center of attention and interrups people when they talk so he could be in the spotlight...The reminding his sister things to do things we dont want her to do when we worked on them for so long. When he is mad too he just puts his head down with an angry look and avoids who he is mad at and holds grudges. I just needed to vent im sorry to ramble on.'

'Sounds like you should stick with the ABA then :) <br /> <br />I had a friend whose son would only eat hot dogs and french fries. Their <br />behavior analyst did a feeding program with him and now he eats all <br />kinds of foods. The nice thing about ABA is they research the BEST ways <br />to address a wide range of issues and then can tailor it for your child. <br /> <br />I remember my behavior analyst told us once that the are hundreds of <br />articles on feeding issues alone in the journal she reads I can\'t remember <br />what it is called but it is where behavioral research is published. There are <br />articles addressing different types of feeding issues too from textures to <br />rigidities to kid\'s doing it for attention. It is so cool how in depth they go <br />on analyzing problems and solutions!'
'I know there are some parents with kids on this board whose kids did not <br />get diagnosed until they entered school. Mine is one of them. While my ds <br />is on the milder end of the spectrum, I don\'t think that that was the (only) <br />reason for the late diagnosis. At age 7 many people will pick up on \'his <br />differences\' fairly fast. <br />He did not have many of the early symptoms that get people\'s attention <br />like obvious stimming or tantrums and rigidity or no speech. He had the <br />symptoms that make a kid look really friendly and precoucious at age 3 <br />but are clearly alarming at age 7. <br /> I just read a book by a mom whose daughter has MR and her daughter is <br />always seeking out people to talk to/at. At age 3 strangers would tell her <br />that her daughter was \'just so smart\' but by the time she was in school it <br />was clear that this behavior was very socially inappropriate. I recognized <br />my son so much in that discription that I started to wonder if a <br />description of social MR would not be more appropriate for my son than <br />asd. I guess they are both developmental disabilities. <br />Anyway -if you have a later diagnosed kid - why do you think it took so <br />long? Is your kid on the mild end? Was there a different diagnosis first? Or <br />does your kid have the kind of symptoms that do not catch anyones <br />attention until later?<div class=\'post_sig\'>- micki, mom to three wonderful and wild kids.  ds 10 asperger & anxiety  twin dds 6 quirky but NT this far</div>'

'<P>If you are talking about private therapy, you certainly can choose who works with your child if you find a few options. Sometimes chemistry makes all the difference.</P> <P>If you are talking about therapy given by the school district, they can\'t simply drop your child. If that\'s the case, let us know so that we can give you pointers about school. <BR><BR>BTW, sitting and paying attention is something the speech therapist has to WORK on. On the other hand, if the therapy is being paid for through insurance, there are certain criteria that have to be met (that don\'t have to be met in school). One of them is that the insurance company asks for progress. If the therapist cannot show progress after a certain amount of time (from one to three months), it\'s the INSURANCE company that drops the child. You might want to look into this since, in that case, your insurance won\'t pay for another therapist right away, either.</P>'

'<P>I am not sure if this is the answer. A program for children with special needs are set up a certain way for a reason. They are also equipped to deal with children like ours. Even though this teacher is willing to work with your daughter it might not be enough. She has other students in the room and if you\'re saying she\'s having problems staying seated then it will arise again at the new school also. I think you posted last week about the riften chair?? I replied with it being similiar to a car seat which we strap our kids in everyday. She doesn\'t have the ability to calm herself enough to sit for long periods of time, and the chair sometimes reinforces that feeling of security and also allows her to realize her body\'s autonomy. I was once told that ASD children don\'t really have a good concept of their body in space, so that\'s why they sometimes have flailing legs and arms , as well as them running about and not being able to sit still. I\'d think you\'d do better to visit the class she\'s currently in and see her sitting in the chair and see how she handles it. Of course initially she\'ll probably be upset because this is something new. Even as babies a child is strapped into a high chair for their own safety. When my son was almost 3 he was in one of those portable feeding chairs that hooked to my kitchen chair because he wouldn\'t eat unless he was in it. So, sometimes you have to think of the long term goal instead of the immediate discomfort you imagine she might experience in the riften chair. I know it\'s not easy, but 3 yrs from now you\'re going to be happy you did this. My son now has no problem sitting for any amount of time the teacher asks of him. </P> <P>Another issue is do they have any aids in the classroom or assistants?? If not it would be a matter of time before the teacher would complain to you that she would be pulled away from the rest of the class because she\'s having to focus on your daughter\'s needs. </P> <P>Ultimately it\'s all about what you\'re comfortable doing. Try things out and see how it goes. She\'s only in pre-k, so she wouldn\'t be missing out on a grade level. </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to Dan 10, asperger\'s, and Mikey 7, moderate ASD</div>'

'Hi everyone. What a nice community you have here. I\'m seeking help <br />about a child i watch in my daycare. He is 3 and a half years old, and has <br />a twin sister. The first time i met him i knew something was very different <br />about him than any other child i had met. I couldn\'t pin point what it was, <br />I just new something was different. I was alwayse thinking \"it\'s like he\'s <br />autistic, but not at the same time\". He has a fairly normal, vocabulary, <br />although it can be difficult to understand him at times. He is Not potty <br />trained, and has no interest in being so, although at this age, it is an <br />inconvienence, but not a red flag. He seems to have no common sense. I <br />cant really describe this anyother way, but it is almost as if he cant take <br />information he has learned and apply it to another area. You have to give <br />him very specific instructions, and he can\'t problem solve it to use his <br />new skills to use it in other areas of development. He can make eye <br />contact, but it is uncomfortable for him, and alwayse breif. He speaks in a <br />rather high pitch voice, and certain words he uses alwayse have the same <br />influx and tone and pitch, and he cant say them any other way. He <br />doesn\'t play with the other children. Ever. He will play along side them, <br />but not \"with\" them the way other children do. He is very regemental in <br />his routine. If any other television program is on than the channel he <br />watches at home, he breaks down sometimes screaming and punching <br />himself in the head, repeating the name of the channel he wants. He <br />cannot share his favourite toys, and if another child finds it and plays with <br />it, it is the same screaming self stim behaviour. He has much difficulity <br />with simple things, like dressing. I have watched him before sit in front of <br />the mirror in the bathroom on the floor for an hour. watching his <br />reflection. He drools constantly. His parents have told me that he does <br />strange things with his feces at home, but i have never (thank god!) had <br />to deal with this at my house. He also has a really hard time transitions <br />from nap to awake. He wakes up sreaming everyday and there is nothing <br />i can do to help him. Most of the time i can\'t even tell what it is that he <br />wants, ge just screams for about half an hour. <br /> <br />Now the frusterating part. His parents don\'t see any problem. They are <br />not even willing to entertain the fact that he should see a specialist. He <br />has a twin sister who shows NONE of these behaviour patterns. A quick <br />glance at the situation should imo indicate a problem that need <br />intervention. I feel torn between comming out and telling them that he <br />needs to see the dr, and just humoring their ignorance. What parent <br />would want to hear that their child wan anything but normal? I know that <br />this is a critical point in his development. What do you guys think? does <br />this sound like anyting you saw, and experienced with you children? <br />Please, any insite would be great. <br /> <br />Please note: This child has no diagnosis since he has seen no dr <br />regarding this'

The stimming does not happen all the time, only when he is overstimulated or excited. The sure/clicking is going on all day and he really does not seem to have any control over it at all.

'<P>What you are running into is very common, as you may find from reading stories on this board.</P> <P>Even though the official explanation for the rise in ASD numbers over the past 15 years is more liberal diagnoses, in fact there are many children who exhibit neurodevelopmental delays that are very similar to autism who are not being diagosed and counted. Instead, you get \"verbal apraxia\" and \"SID\" and \"emotional delay\". That\'s very common. </P> <P>The doctors providing the diagnoses may be technically correct that your child fails to exhibit the right pattern of symptoms to fit clearly into the ASD nosology, and yet that is quite irrelevant when it comes to your child. If your child isn\'t ASD, then what is he? There isn\'t a compelling system of classification to describe his problems. And what that means, in my opinion, is that the medical community is seeing an increase in neurodevelopmental delays and has failed to create a corresponding classification system to describe the children, and so you get multiple diagnoses that occur in clusters, which is a clear sign that something is not being accurately described.</P> <P>For example, my daughter has a language delay that is indistinguisable from the language problems seen in autism. She also has sensory issues. She received three diagnoses; verbal apraxia, developmental language disorder, and sensory integration disorder. Clinical research has demonstrated that there is common genetic link between DLD and autism, and the language areas of the brain in both DLD and autism are affected in exactly the same way. So, what she actually has is closely related to what other children who are diagnosed with PDD-NOS actually have. It is related to PDD-NOS genetically, structurally in the brain, and in presenting symptoms. And yet, when you just look at her diagnoses, the actual disorders are rare and do not appear to be linked to autism, and no researcher would count her as part of a \"rise in autism\". </P> <P>I think that the actual issue may be that PDD-NOS resembles autism, but in fact represents a unique group of children with a broad range of neurodevelopmental delays encompassing language, social interaction, sensory processing, and emotional development that have never been seen before, and is the result of things in the enviornment working on specific genes. But that\'s just my opinion- only time will tell if I am right. </P> <P>So, in your case, I agree with the people who are telling you to push for a ASD diagnosis. That is a better description of what you are actually dealing with than a cluster of secondary diagnoses, even though your child pushes the envelope of the classification system. Until they revise the classsification system, ASD is the best description of what you are dealing with.</P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- 5-year old girl with mild PDD-NOS    13 and 19 year old NT girls</div>'

I am a proud mom of four children 2 teen boys, 17 and 16, and 1 6 1/2 year old son named Logan that was diagnosed with PDD/NOS Autism at 3 1/2, and last but not least I was blessed with another angel, my baby girl Abigail Grace that is 2 1/2. I am looking for friends and support. My son is a true blessing and I love him with all my heart, he is mostly non verbal, but coming along. Very very smart and loves the water so much that he works hard to get out just to go to our local pool and that is becoming a problem. My son is what they call and Eloper, if anyone else has this in common or suggestions for me, I would so appreciate it. It seems the only people that understand what I go through on a daily basis is other moms like me. I have to lock our house up like a jail because my son wants to go to the pool. We moved to a new neighbor hood 2 years in July and I thought it would be wonderful since it had a waterpark type pool. Well it\'s been a nightmare, now he just waits for the moment someone doesn\'t lock the door and he takes off. He never got out until we moved here and I went through all the trouble of talking with my neighbors, even took Logan door to door to meet them and give them a brochure with his picture and a little info about him and contact if in case he ever got out again. I also have a bracelet with all his info on it. Well, now that summer is here, he has gotten out at least 4 times, two of the times, the neighbor I thought was my friend got him and when I went to thank her she jumped me and treated me like I was a terriable mother, I was so shocked at that moment and the fact that she did it in front of all my neighbors in the circle, that I just walked away for then and I just cried and cried. I talked to her later and she said that I needed to get help and that I shouldn\'t have left my son with my 17 year old, who has let him get out before. I agreed, but the problem is, he has gotten out on my husband too, and even me twice, but luckily I was able to catch him before he got far from the house. Anyway, there is so much more I could tell you about my son, but the main thing is he is my baby and I want to help him get better or just have a better life in the future. There is not one day I don\'t search for help or cures or whatever for him and for her to judge me and treat me like I was a horriable neglectful mother. She has one child that will be a year next month, I have four kids that I have managed to raise just fine, Logan is just smarter than most of us and the older he gets them more challenging it gets.

She is very HF and almost seems like she doesn\'t even have autism lately, just this awful defiant and oppositional behavior.

'<P>I appreciate the welcome and the kind words. It is nice to come to a place where people actually understand where you are coming from.</P> <P>We have been looking into the weighted clothing. A vest specifically. He goes down ok at night, but he doesn\'t always go straight to bed. He is in bed by 8-8:30 (if all goes as planned) and sometimes he will tussle around in his bed for an hour or so. Sometimes he thumps on his bed and often he speaks. It seems that he is having a conversation. It is a concern, but I think it helps him to decompress.</P> <P>If he hears me creep up the stairs he will sometimes say, \"Hi Daddy. I love you. Goodnight Daddy.\" I hate to ignore that, but we all know...that just leads to more when he should be sleeping.</P> <P>Bathtime is what has me really concerned now. We usually end the evening downstairs with reading and music (sometimes art). He will usually come upstairs and have me read a few books. (more recently my wife and I have been switching off nights. He was VERY Daddy centered for a long time. Now Mommy can take some of it). Then we crawl to the bathroom and he will say, \"Spider Daddy Spider.\" He wants me to cuddle with him. If I do not break this it will go on forever so I count down, \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1...\" On with the bath.</P> <P>It used to be so easy to get him in the tub, but now we have had to remove the shower curtain before he gets in or he will play peekaboo forever. Sometimes he says he wants to get on the potty (we are working so hard on this). We always allow that and sometimes he pees...sometimes nada. Bravo and onward. Now we will spend a good amount of time trying to get him into the bath. I don\'t do the power struggle with him anymore. I let him know that if he does not start towads the bath that the clothes are coming off and I will count it down. This usually gets it done. Then there are all sorts of games in the bath that prolong this process. Splashing has become an issue. Thing is...I know he is being gamey! This is where I see behavioral not PDD. He gets this big mischevious smile on his face just before he pulls this stuff and he knows that it will not be well-received. After we finally get out of the bath it is time to brush teeth and then read \"The Giving Tree.\" We still give him one ounce of rice milk in my lap and then a binky (which I want to get rid of). He climbs right into bed.</P> <P>the hitting, pushing, kicking and splashing...gotta go. Also the yelling! His metdowns are often and loud.</P> <P>As for the tics etc...that you mention Elle, I have seen facial scrunching, crossed eyes and some other tics for a long time now and I keep getting told that they are nothing. I wonder if I need to push that issue.</P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by camusa on April 24 2007 at 12:14pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Buddha Boy is 7 yrs old Dx w/ PDD-NOS,BBT 13 mos</div>'

'Hi Joanna, <br />Reactive airway is the same thing as asthma. They just won\'t diagnose <br />asthma before age 2 because sometimes they grow out of it. We have NO <br />family history of asthma, and his allergy tests are as clean as they can be! <br />Of course, we think that milk is a HUGE component of it, so we have <br />removed all milk from his diet. <br /> <br />We did strict GF with the already CF that we were doing for 4 months. We <br />saw stimming decrease, though it was not a HUGE problem for him. <br />Other than that, we saw no changes at all. We had an accidental slip from <br />the diet when getting stuck at an airport for 12 hours. When we gave him <br />a sandwich (first wheat in 4 months) we saw no change whatsoever. It <br />just wasn\'t worth it for us. Everyone said he would start talking more, but <br />he actually started to talk about a month after we ceased the GF part and <br />has made progress every since. I guess I could say that the gluten gave <br />him speech, but I know that it was just that things clicked for him at that <br />time. I think that is what worries me....giving credit to the wrong things. <br />This such a hard path to know what actually works and what doesn\'t! <br /> <br />One thing that we have noticed as far as foods go is that he does seem to <br />have more issues if he has had anything with chocolate, high-fructose <br />corn syrup or some food dyes...especially RED! <br /> <br />I hope you find out what is causing the excessive stimming.

'How severe are her feeding issues? Is the pediatrician concerned about lack of weight gain/growth? If so, you could look into getting a referral for a feeding clinic -usually provided through a local hospital. <br /> <br />If she\'s healthy and continuing to gain weight appropriately, you can relax a bit. Make sure she takes a good vitamin, and continue to offer a variety of foods and encourage her to try them -but don\'t make it into a huge battle. It\'ll slowly improve over time, and they\'ll begin to accept more foods. <br /> <br />We tend to feel like \'bad parents\' if a child doesn\'t eat a balanced diet, but really it\'s not such a huge deal. I was a very picky eater growing up, and I still am. Food was a huge issue in my house growing up and I remember having to sit at the table for hours until I either ate what they wanted me to, or they gave up (and they usually gave up eventually <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley2.gif\" border=\"0\"> - never underestimate the determination of a stubborn child). I eat only a few fruits and very few vegetables (really only potatoes), and I\'m healthy. <br /> <br />While eating a variety of foods is ideal for optimum health, its not an actual necessity. My son is very picky. He refused most foods and would only eat pb&j,french toast, pancakes, cheese, poptarts, jello,and pudding. If he HAD to try anything else, he would often gag and spit it out on the table. We\'d encourage him to try just one small bite of each food, and just recently he\'s become more willing to do so. He doesn\'t spit on the table much anymore, but he will ocassionally gag or spit into a napkin. Only recently did he begin eating chicken nuggets ocassionally. And just the other day, he actually ate a turkey and cheese sandwich! (doesn\'t sound like much but its huge for him because its rare for him to eat any meat). <br /> <br />I know its frustrating! But you\'re doing your job as a parent by making healthy foods available. Its kind of like the adage \'You can lead a horse to water, but you can\'t make him drink\'. You can always supplement with pediasure or other nutritional supplements for kids - just check with your doctor first. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Jen -Mom to Jacob (7)HFA and ADHD, and Mikey (6)</div>'
'<P>My five cents:</P> <P>I think be honest but also give him space . Let him know that you know from experience that they are looking for kids who have practised a lot and are very good at it already and that that is not him. But if he feels strongly that he should try out anyway let him know that as a 14 years old he can take the lead on it.</P> <P>You can try to give him the information he needs to make an informed decision but if that is not convincing to him you should let him try. If you stop him he might not get humiliated, but he will never know that because he will always look at it as you holding him back from being able to do something. If he tries and fails refrain from \"Told you\" and let him know that you are bummed too and maybe sneak in a little behavior mapping (as in explaining cause and effect). And if he tries out and gets in or they find some way to include him - well good for him and he would have made us all look stupid.

'<P>Rita-</P> <P>I just wanted to let you know that I would not worry so much about the MR. Language problems do not =MR. Oftentimes it is difficult to access intelligence when your child is unable to understand the directions given to them. This does not mean they are MR. Now that my son is able to better understand directions and has a longer attention span to show us what he knows, we have discovered he is quite bright. Aidan regressed at about 16 months. At 20 months he was unable to follow directions and had a very limited expressive vocabulary. He is 36 months now, and his receptive and expressive has really picked up. And on non-verbal parts of the testing he excels. In time, you may be surprised to find how much your daughter knows.</P> <P>AS for EI in NJ.......I personally think their recommendations are very vague so you could potentially be fighting for services. You also copay for services. In NY, we don\'t pay anything and in EI the DOH recommendations are for a minimum of 20 hours ABA. I do think though that NJ has some excellent private schools available and I believe depending on the district they have some nice school age programs as well. Anyway, if you haven\'t already check out <A href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/health/fhs/&#100;ocuments/autismguidelines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.state.nj.us/health/fhs/documents/autismguidelines .pdf</A></P> <P>Also, do you have a diagnosis yet? How far are you from NYC. The developmental pediatrician that we see is very familiar with EI in the tristate area. She gives wonderful advice about services and how to get them.

'<P>United HC can be a pain - we have them and have had to fight for coverage every inch of the way. We have gotten some therapy covered though, so it\'s worth the effort. What\'s helped us is getting DS\'s therapies through a rehab center that\'s affiliated with a local hospital. The billing department there has been a huge help with fighting the insurance company, figuring out what coding will work, etc. </P> <P>You should also ask about discounted billing for the uninsured. Most facilities offer some sort of discount. If there\'s a pediatric rehab clinic that operates through a hospital, they\'re likely to have the best uninsured discount - it\'s 37% off for any part of DS\'s therapies that our insurance won\'t cover. </P> <P>School systems provide services starting at 3 - even if you moved, EI really should have set you up with them.

'My son has used silly names for us, too. It annoys me. I don\'t answer him and try to downplay it. Honestly, it\'s harmless and I think it\'s my son\'s attempt at humor and it\'s definitely an attempt to get attention. It has not entirely gone away over the years, but it\'s very limited now. Igoring and not giving the desired attention works. My guess is that the inappropriate touching is similar but has a sensory component. Getting up and moving the SECOND he touches is key. At 6 it\'s merely annoying. At 13 it\'s BAD and can be transferred to others. Speak to a behavioral expert about the best way to approach a BIP for this.'

'Should be the name of a book? lol. I\'m really concerned with my son and his reactions to gifts this year. He\'s gotten more - sullen I guess is the word. He\'s definetly now showing more signs to me of depression and his agressive tantrums seem more like total rages to me. Anyway, we decided to \'prep\' for Christmas a little bit during advent season. We have an advent calendar and each day the kids pull out a slip with an activity or project that we do together. From watching home movies, to baking cookies, collecting old toys/books to take to the shelter, that sort of thing.<br><br>I put into the calendar a few nights of \'preChristmas gifts\' so that we can do some pre-teaching about what you do when you get a gift. Since in the past we\'ve had him crying that he didnt\' want that and its embarassing for me and dh, simply bad manners and the kid melts down. Its still happening. Last night the kids were cold - that doesn\'t happen often here in Arizona lol - so after bath daddy made a small fire in the fireplace and mama gave them an advent gift. I had bought two camo fleece blankets and brought them out and gave them each one. My 8yo daughter as always responded first and said \"oh wow! thanks mama. This is perfect!\" and wrapped herself up in it. My son totally lost it screaming \"a blanket isn\'t a present. I wanted a toy. I don\'t even want this. Go give it to someone else\". <br>So, um - yah, thats not going to work for me Christmas eve with the inlaws or Christmas day with my family. After the meltdown ended we talked a little bit about what kinds of gifts there are - cloths, books etc and what a gift means, that someone is giving you something because they love you and its not what is inside the box that matters but that the person thought enough to want to give you something. We talked about the greatest gift (it did get a little religious so I\'ll spare you) and the reason for the season (again) - but he\'s still not getting it.<br><br>We\'re going to continue of course over the next weeks talking about it and trying to get him geared up for holidays but I\'m curious if anyone else deals with this and how you deal with it.<br><br>:)<br>Happy Holidays<br><br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- ~Barb  Mama to Chelsey,19, Zoey,8 & Roman, 5   & wife to my best friend Tom for 10 years</div>'

'<P>With B, the signs were there from birth of severe sensory issues. He hit all of his physical milestones on time, but hated to be held as a baby. He would scream to be put down. I knew definitely between 12 and 18 months when the incessant rocking started. Took me till he was 2 years 10 months to get a diagnosis because back then, I didn\'t know about evaluations through the school system.</P> <P>With Jacob, he progressed perfectly fine until age 2. He hit all of his physical milestones. I didn\'t know that he was supposed to be pointing by age 12 months though...and that was my first real red flag with him. He seemed to just stop developing a little after age 2. Then we had a regression where he lost words/skills. Another big red flag...but I didn\'t know it then, at 18 months, he started to use the computer...but not like a baby typically would. By age 20 months, he could shut down the computer \"the correct way\". By age 24 months, he knew how to open up the programs folder to run his favorite programs (windows media player and itunes were the big ones.) By 36 months he was trying to do a complete system restore. Last week he uninstalled 3 programs, again...the correct way. He also likes to hide Easter eggs for me all the time. He\'s moved so many files it\'s really challenging to find the one I want sometimes. I don\'t know how he did it, but he moved one of my picture folders over to the program files folder about 6 months ago. I ended up having to do a search from the start menu to find that one.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mary,    Mom to B (5.5 - ASD, apraxia, SPD, PICA, saying more words every day)    and J (3 - Educational label of developmentally delayed, finally verbal, OCD traits, ADHD traits)</div>'

What I don\'t understand (and I don\'t mean to direct this at you, I just mean to post a wondering statement about any woman who lives for a long time with a man she doesn\'t make her husband) is why women live with men who are not making their lives better but who, in many cases, make their lives worse. If a guy is not husband material (and many are not), why is he given the position of husband? I am not talking about men who leave their dirty socks around and expect maid service. That can usually be fixed with counseling or even without it. I\'m talking about women who allow men to live with them when the man is really not an equal partner in the relationship. I have just never understood this. I\'m actually not talking about husbands, now. Because at least at one point in the past, that man made a commitment and that woman thought he was worth commiting to. I\'m thinking about the women who\'ve posted that they\'ve lived with boyfriends for a long time and marriage was nowhere on the horizon. Frankly, unless a man was willing to share my life, the good AND the bad of it, I wouldn\'t allow him to live with me. Maybe I\'d spend lots of time with him and sleep with him and even love him, but giving him a foothold in my HOME would require a ring. I think that is the only way we women and our children have ANY protection. Some women have even had multiple children with a man who won\'t commit, so they have few if any legal protections. To me, this is not a matter of morality but one of practicality. If a man is living with a woman but not fully committed, is it really any wonder that he doesn\'t participate? This sort of arrangement works for NOBODY in the situation.

Even though there is a medicaid waiver for those with ASD children its a long waiting list to get on.

'<P>Today I ran across a Newsweek article on autism dated July 3rd, 2007. I don\'t think anyone has posted it yet. It\'s about a Kennedy Krieger study of 107 baby siblings of autistics. They tried to see if it\'s possible to diagnose autism as early as 14 months. </P> <P>Thirty of the 107 kids ended up with an autism label, but only half of those were diagnosable at age 14 months. Diagnosing so early was not easy, and required that Dr. Landa re-trained her eyes to see how autism looks at age 14 months. Dr. Landa has devoted her entire professional career to diagnosing autism, so what hope does the less-experienced professional have, let alone the average parent or pediatrician?</P> <BLOCKQUOTE>\"I had to learn to retrain my eyes when I started to see the 14-month-olds. I thought autism at 14 months was going to look like autism at 36 months, the age at which people normally diagnose it. It\'s the same flavor-the social system is disrupted, the communication system is disrupted. But it\'s different in that it\'s not as pervasively disrupted. What I mean is that at 14 months, you can get kids with autism to give you a beautiful response to peekaboo. But you can\'t get the child to engage with you around more novel, new activities. At 14 months, you see more flickers of interaction. They were doing some looking at people and smiling.\" </BLOCKQUOTE> <P>Dr. Landa also guessed that a blood test was 5 years away, minimum.

'Their is always something out their that different ppl think caused their child to have a developmental disorder. My mom did not drink, nor did she use any pharmisuticals during her pregancy and i was still messed up, although only mildly. I agree with boo bear i ddoubt medication has much to do with it, its simple nature vs. nurture, and genetics definatly contribute at least 50% of the variables that may be the cause. I hope u all dont beat yourself up over it u did not know, and i have never seen conclusive evidence to support a claim that medication, similar to those talked about on here caused new borns to have these kinds of problems. <br /> <br />I do beleive a study should be done tho, although pharm companys spend years doing research on these drugs b4 thr FDA approves them it should be more like decades before conclusive results can show if its true or not. <br /> <br />The fact is, that rates for autism, to my knowledge, in developed nations their is always an similar incidense of developmental dissabilities no matter what. Even in deveolping or underdeveloped nations, although their is worse health care in those, theirfore less are diagnosed. <br /> <br />I have heard over the years just too many different causes, too many variables, im sure its a combination of many, but genetics is probably the #1 variable in the equation. <br /> <br /><div class=\'post_sig\'>- DX\'ed with HFA as a child.

'<font size=\"2\"> <br />Well, as I said to LaceyOne last week, I wouldn\'t get too hung up on the label too terribly much. Here\'s what I\'d ask myself: <em>How well do I know my child? Do I see anything that he needs that fits the ASD picture? If so, would a formal diagnosis help by providing needed assistance, or would it only apply a label seeing as how I can help him myself knowing what I know about autism?</em> <br /> <br />One thing that is pretty well-established at this point: Dx\'s on the high end of the spectrum (which is basically encompassed by PDD-NOS and Asperger\'s) can be difficult to recognize at given intervals because the symptoms can appear to fade in and out as environmental circumstances vary. A lot of times professionals who are not well-versed in recognizing the symptoms can overlook a PDD-NOS or an aspie because the individual may learn to perform well for evaluations but then the symptoms may show up more when they are in less controlled surroundings, or in situations that are more stressful to <em>them</em>, which may not necessarily be the situations you would expect. <br /> <br />If I were you though, I would focus mostly on tending to what your child needs as an individual rather than get too worried on what he\'s Dx\'ed with, or if he has a diagnosis at all. That\'s NOT to say that you aren\'t tending to him already, of course. But I believe that a good understanding between you and him will do a lot more than any \"professional\" can, especially if he\'s high-functioning. <br /> <br />Best wishes.<div class=\'post_sig\'>-   ~Nick   Still in touch with my inner child ;)</div>'

'If your child is in a private school, Catholic or otherwise, your school district has strict limits on how much they CAN do for your son. It really has nothing to do with his dx but with how the school district wishes to distribute a portion of its special ed funds to the private schools children who live within the district go to. There is NOTHING that forces them to spend a dime on an individual child who is enrolled in a private school. They ARE required to spend a portion of their overall special ed budget on helping out the schools kids from their district go to, but there is not requirement of HOW they should spend that $$. For example, they can choose to spend that percentage on updating the computer software in one private school and not giving a dime to another. Or they might pay for a speech therapist for your son\'s school but if your son doesn\'t need speech, he won\'t personally benefit. For an IEP to be fully in place, the child must go to the public school. Of course, the PRIVATE school can CHOOSE to implement your son\'s IEP as written by the public school, but they won\'t necessarily receive any financial support for doing it, so that is entirely up to the school he is attending. If he\'s getting his full IEP in place in his Catholic school, thank the Catholic school because it\'s voluntary on their part.'
'Jakesmom, I\'m sorry I can\'t offer advice on how to get your son potty-trained in time for kindergarten or what SDs have to do about it. All I can share is my own potty-training experience so that it may give you hope. The summer before my son started his integrated preschool, he was 3 1/2 and beginning to potty-train. His potty-training was supposed to be part of his school day program. He came home with wet pull-ups and within a month or so of starting school, quit trying to go on his own. He was at school all day, and the bottom line was there were too many kids in the class for them to keep on top of everyone\'s toileting. Also, he never felt botherd by being soaking wet or soiled, and I began to think it was sensory, too. He moved to an ABA preschool this year. By the second week of Sept., he was urinating in the toilet at school on set schedule. I followed the schedule at home the best I could. He didn\'t always have to go, but he tried. By the end of November, he surprised me one day by just up and going to the toilet on his own, then yelling out to me \"I go pee-pee potty!.\" We only had a couple accidents after that, and I was ecstatic. He was not having BMs at school, but my son gave me one of the best Christmas presents when a couple weeks before, he up and went to the toilet on his own, sat and did his business. From that day, we have never had a BM accident. I truly believe it was his program at school that finally got him there. In January, I asked to send him to school in underwear, and he has never had an accident. He turned five in February.<br><br>The frustration I felt when he was 3 1/2 at regressing has turned to pure joy and undying graditude with his current preschool. I remember thinking what would I do if he wasn\'t potty-trained for kindergarten? Would he have to stay in preschool another year? Would he be teased? Now, I recently sat in on two inclusion kindergarten classes (as an observer) in the public school. There were children in pull-ups, and an aide (I believed a shared one) who would take the one child to the bathroom with a clean pull up in hand. I find it so hard to believe your SD would require him to be potty-trained if he is special needs child. Sounds like the SD may be trying to bend things to the way that is concvenient for them thinkning you are a parent who will take what they say as the final word. Do you have an advocate or know where you could talk to one? I would suggest getting one who is very knowledgeable about the law and ask them to be a part of your IEP meeting. (I am doing this for my son\'s kindergarten IEP).<br><br>I know this is hard, but if he is making some progress, then he knows what to do, it just may have to be on his time. I don\'t think taking things away from him would work as he may not understand that concept. My suggestion would be to reward the attempts and successes.

We never had heard of Asperger\'s before but when we read the discription of it we knew that was our son. He will only wear soft clothing and has to have soft bedding as well it was pretty funny going to the bedding section to buy satin sheets for a 7 year old, he has extremely sensitive ears and we have learned to have ear plugs handy, has 2 subjects that he is really interested in Star Wars and the computer. He has minor interests that used to be his only ones such as animals, he has trouble with his fine motor skills. I want to help him however I can to have a successful school career 2 weeks ago he didn\'t make it through a single day, he had to stay in the office because of how disruptive his meltdowns were.

'<P>Hello I have a question and I hope someone cna help. My son Sam is 6 and has PDD and ADHD. He\'s pretty typical of other autistic kids. He has his limited interests and only wants to dwell on those few topics. He also has trouble with language and understanding jokes, euphimisms and figures of speech. I think it makes him feel awkward. So in the few times when he says something that is funny. He tries to use this same joke over and over to elicit a laugh. I tried to explain to him that jokes and funny turns of phrase that are not intentional are only funny the first time. </P> <P>He also struggles with conversation. He is very one sided and wants to talk about animals all the time, facts, stastictisc, etc. Not interesting to everyone. So because he is comfortable with this he talks in circles. He wants to have the same conversations ALL THE TIME. I\'ve gotten to a point where I stop conversations when he starts this. He has to begin to understand that altough this is a form of finding security, because he can predict it. I am tired of the \"Mommy what\'s your favorite large wild cat?\" He already knows: cheetah. I told him the last time he did this that I\'m not going to answer this question again. I worry that he will push people away with this tactic. I know it is his way of communicationg and feeling competant, but is there another way to help him in this? Am I going about it wrong? The only way to help him change the problem is to help him find a new way and if I continue to have the same conversations over and over again I am only enabling his crutch of falling back on what he feels is a time when he was in contrtol and confident. </P> <P>What to do?</P>'
'At 2.5 Johnny was diagnosed very mild pdd-nos. He had a lot of positives at the time (nice eye contact, pretty social etc) but there were enough things to warrant a diagnosis at the time.<br><br>Fast forward a year..we went back to Kennedy Krieger and met with a team of doctors (one included a pediatric neurologist). They were diff. doctors than last year as the one he had last year left KK. They were in agreement this time around that he no longer meets criteria for an autism diagnosis. I was pretty surprised because, well, I had been told it doesn\'t often happen. However..last year they thought that if his language kept taking off he could be one of those who does lose the label.<br><br>This doesn\'t by any means we are \"issue\" free. I don\'t feel any differently about him. Nor would I have if the label remained the same. He is an awesome kid..always has been, always will be. He is a bit socially awkward although he tries pretty hard, lol. He interacted with the team so well...answered all their questions, asked to try on their \"doctor gear\" etc...lol. We went through the ADOS, they retested certain things and were in full agreement that he isn\'t on the spectrum.<br><br>The \"new\" label is ADHD. Which we all knew wayyy before they told us.

'<P>You know i hadnt even thought about ADHD! I mean i was thinking adhd but mainly autism but its entirely possible and if he does only have ADHD then it is definately real severe. His time outs are being sent to his room where he sits on his bed pouting and thinking about what hes done wrong. This he does but things are still happening, so it seems ineffective even tho he is usually fully cooperating with the time outs in his bedroom. I dont think something is just bothering him because hes always had issues as a small newborn he was constantly crying and his sleeping habibits were horrendous hed wake up at the tiniest sound and hard to get to sleep, hed dislike being held, was not engaged and the eye contact was always a problem, hed gag on food and have to sleep with a lullaby cd blasting right by his ear or hed wake up at the smallest sounds so hes always had issues. But i will also say that his dad has not been keeping in touch with him and hasnt seen him in ages but thats nothing new and then theres the move but hes been like this before the move so id say no.</P> <P>I do talk to her about it nonchanlantly and stuff and i know she knows something is not right but i think she doesnt know what to do. Shes taken him to a behaviorist whos mentioned autism but didnt dx and said hed have to be evaluated thru the school because he needed a structured setting. He was evaluated thru someone else thru the school and they said he needed a structured enviornment but didnt say he had anything at all adhd, autism nothing, just that he needed lots of structure and socialization and that his speech was fine for his age. So i think shes probably confused right now. Im hoping when he goes into preschool someone will bring something up to her because she prob thinks i think everyone has something \'wrong\' with them because my son has autism, kwim?</P> <P>I have an idea, i bought a small cardboard treasure chest box and 2 small soft balls, 2 squishy fishys, bubbles and playdoh to put into it and i was thinking they both can only play with the box at gmas house or rather whenever they are visiting eachother that way they can both be playing with things safely. At least that can eliminate him hitting with the toys hes playing with. I thought a video they are both interested in in it would be a good idea that way they can watch it only during those times and it wont be so played out maybe as well as the other godies in the box. Also a sticker chart. I was thinking they will both be rewarded immeidately for not tatelltelling or hitting and then move it up to earning enogh stickers at the end of the visit and then going to the prize box. I think it might help and work so im excited to try it out!

'I did not seen any thread started for week four, so I am starting one.<br><br>For those who have not been following these threads:<br><br>A small group of us are reading the book \"From Emotions to Advocacy - Second edition\" from Wright\'s Law (can be purchased on-line from Wrightslaw.com or Amazon.com, and probably elsewhere, the 2nd edition refers to te IDEA 2004) This Monday (4-Feb-06) started the 4th week.

I think that most of us are in the third section.<br><br>tzoya started the threads, and I would yield to tzoya in a second, I just think that this is sufficiently important that I am stepping in to be sure it keeps going.<br><br>A thought re: Chapter 12; writing goals.<br><br>The chapter pretty much spells out how to tell when you\'ve been given a bad goal. But I am not sure how to replace it with a good goal. I am not a child develpoment specialist, and so I don\'t know how to predict a year\'s worth of progress. Particularly since now the goals go for a year without intermediate goals. [Prior to IDEA 2004 the IEP was required to have intermediate goals, which seemed to make sense since they aligned with the reporting periods, which are required.] I also do not know what tests are available to measure the various develpoment goals.<br><br>My sons are fairly high function ASD types and so their disability is of the type a bit below what Michele Garica Winner aims for in her Center for Social Thinking (google Center for ... it you have not heard of her before. You\'ve found it if you see a rubber chicken logo). So I am thinking that I need to write theory of mind sort of goals, and that stumps me.<br><br>So the only solution I have been able to think up is that I have to play the part of the dump parent and slow tease the answers out of the school staff by asking the right questions until they see that a good (\"SMART\") goal can be written. We don\'t discuss goals much in our IEPs mainly placements, so I wanted to know if anyone has tried this sort of thing and if it worked or not.<br><br>[Don\'t jump all over me for letting placements get discussed before goals, our IEP meetings seem all about getting my son(s) into a private placement paid for by the parents, and so steering them back on course is a challenge that I am still learning.]<br> <span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Dad2Luke&Alan on February 06 2007 at 3:27pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it - U Sinclair  We choose to go to the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard - JFK</div>'

'I think it is very common for kids with ASD to have \"uneven\" development (don\'t know if that is the right word - have certain aspects develop faster than others). My son is the reverse of yours. His imaginary play skills are almost age-approprate, but his language has always been his greatest struggle. I think the things you suggested sound right on. I would try to play on his level. If he is having trouble with imaginary play, start with more realistic play first (cooking, cleaning - something concrete he sees every day). Then when he initiates that play himself, push it to more imaginary. I also think I would tie into his interests if play isn\'t really his thing. I think I remember you writing he likes electronics (sorry, if I have the wrong person). If so, are there games he plays on the computer that you could recreate as non-electronic games? My son\'s imaginary play started by taking things he saw in books and acting them out with figures. He then moved to making up his own stories (which is his favorite now :)'

'I think that one of the things that helps is changing one\'s perspective. I don\'t wish to downplay the dysfunction autism causes, but when you develop a sense of being okay with it, it helps you with your emotional health.<br><br>I remember when Clarissa was about 4, she used to stim by running around and humming in the basement. It used to bother me for two reasons. One was that I couldn\'t stand the humming. The other was that I thought that, even after my busy day, I had to go and *help her* start a game or activity even though I was tired and just wanted to sit down and read online. I felt really guilty because I thought *I had to do that*- fix her EVERY problem, and if I didn\'t I was being a bad mommy.<br><br>I later learned that it was stimming, not boredom, and while stimming bothers me, she\'s not unhappy with it.<br><br>When I figured *she wasn\'t unhappy* then I wasn\'t unhappy, either. I didn\'t have to entertain her all the time.<br><br>So maybe the way your child enjoys life isn\'t the same way that the rest of the world does. That\'s okay. If he likes stimming, it may not be the most developmentally productive activity, but he\'s happy. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO CURE EVERYTHING. You do not have to \"make\" him normal on all fronts. If he\'s happy, that should be cause for your happiness. Nobody has a cure for autism. A cure is a nice thing, but his happiness may be the better goal. He may live in a group home some day in the future. He may not be unhappy in that setting. It might be ideal for him.<br><br>That\'s what it\'s about, right: producing happy children, not necessarily high-achieving children.<br><br>And I really relate to you not knowing your child. I would say that that has been one of the harder things about autism. When Clarissa was about 4 or 5, I had a deep sense that I didn\'t know her. She was verbal, but couldn\'t spontaneously express what was in her head. When she did occasionally do that, I was so happy. I really latched on to those momentary insights. I remember we had a conversation- about 4 exchanges- and it felt so good.<br><br>Now Clarissa is 7 and I have a much better sense of what she thinks, and I am so grateful for it.<br><br>Your child really is young, and lots of therapy can produce stunning progress. <br><br>The uncertainty is difficult to deal with, too. I don\'t know where my daughters will be in 20 years. I really can\'t dwell on it. Who knows where autism therapy will be at that time?<br><br>You just have to take it one step at a time, and accept some \"imperfection\"- that you didn\'t do therapy every waking hour, that you lazed around when you could have been doing OT homework or whatever. You can\'t let the disability ruin your life, is what I\'m trying to say. Leave room for other stuff. Leave room for just being a family.<br><br><br><br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mother of  Clarissa born 2001/12/25 -HFA  Francesca born 2005/04/04 - PDD-NOS  Emily Rose born 2008/06/30</div>'

I saw this little <br />boy literally drag him to my classroom in the morning, sit with him at a <br />separate lunch table at lunch (we had issues getting him to eat, and his <br />mother suggested that he eat with his brother to get him to eat.... this <br />was not suggested by any of the school staff....), she also wanted him to <br />play with him on the playground, etc. I can see that a parent would want <br />their child to have a \"partner\" in life, but at the same time, WAY too much <br />pressure was put on this little boy. One day, my little guy wouldn\'t come <br />into my room (he was mad about something) and his brother was pulling <br />his arm, \"Come on, GET IN THERE -. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE LIKE <br />THIS? WHY CANT YOU JUST BE A NORMAL BROTHER?\" And I sort of <br />intervened, told him thank you, etc. <br /> <br />I felt OH so badly for this little brother, because he loved his older brother <br />dearly, but at the same time did not understand why he had to deal with <br />all of this stuff. It doesn\'t sound like your daughter is in the SAME <br />situation, but still is feeling the frustrations of living in a \"Differently <br />Abled\" family. The day that happened, I had my student make a \"Why I <br />love my brother\" poster. I had a picture from a living/non-living exercise <br />in my email of the two of them. I printed it and put it in the middle. My <br />para and I did the little dot letters for - to trace over. We wrote things <br />like \"you\'re the only one who understands me sometimes.\" \"you love me <br />more than anyone.\" \"you know that I\'m different but you treat me equally.\" <br />\"I love playing soccer with you on the playground.\" \"You\'re the greatest <br />brother ever.\" etc. <br /> <br />I\'m sure this did not SOLVE the problem, but you should have seen little <br />brother\'s eyes light up when big brother presented this \"project\" to him <br />(we really did it up with glitter and laminated it, etc!) <br /> <br />I am sure your little girl is just feeling as sad as parents do sometimes. <br />Doesn\'t everyone wish \"Why can\'t I have a normal family?\" I think that a <br />perfect response would be \"no family is normal. every family is different!\" <br />Anthony is sorry for the way that he acts sometimes. He is frustrated <br />because he can\'t tell you himself how much he loves you. He is frustrated <br />that he can\'t tell us that he wants french fries. It is very hard for him to <br />not be able to tell us things that he is thinking. YOU are a wonderful <br />sister to him and he is very lucky to have you. <br /> <br /> <br />I\'m probably no help but I thought I\'d take a stab. I would second the <br />idea of perhaps some one on one time with your daughter. You could also <br />look into camps. I know here in TX we have a camp called CAMP CAMP <br />and NT kids go with their differently abled siblings, but they have <br />separate activities. Mom gets a break, sibs get a break, it\'s perfect for <br />everyone! <br /> <br />http://www.serve.com/campcamp/ - maybe you have something <br />similar in NY? <br /> <br /> <br /><div class=\'post_sig\'>-   \"We should not strive to change the child with autism to fit the learning environment; rather we need to change the learning environment to fit the learning characteristics of the child.\" (TEACCH)</div>'

'<P>One thing that my ds loved (and still does!) is tools and a workbench. This is something that will come in handy if you have playdates as well - it is something to help the kids connect. </P> <P>My son is well past that age so it\'s a little hard to remember. But, the other thing he really loved was a toy vacuum he had - although I\'m not sure if you want to start that or not! He also had a toy cleaning set that kids loved as well when they came over to play. Even though ds wasn\'t actually \"playing with\" the kids, they were all working together and \"cleaning\". The set was something I got at Toys \'R Us and had a broom, dustpan, mop, bucket and I forget what else.

'<P>Is this a regular teacher or a special ed teacher? if it\'s a regular teacher she may not be trained to see the distinguishing signs of a special child, especially an ASD child, also not every learning or developmental disability is always pronounced so.. </P> <P>Also, I think you were possibly making assumptions about what she was saying.

We have him in special ed because he just can\'t handle the large classes and the constant AHHHHHHHH that always goes on in them.. especially when he was younger, and he can do the work on grade level but he chooses not to so that is also very frustrating, so it\'s best he stays where he is for his sake and the sake of the teacher... </P> <P>Just say thank you and maybe give a short explanation.. but I wouldnt go into grave details, people tend to tune out.. unless someone asks questions.

'<P>Hi,</P> <P>I don\'t know if this is related, but I just wanted to say that my husband had poop accidents through elementary school. He said he literally could not tell when he had to go until it was too late (he has low tone and sensory issues like our son), and plus he just found out that on top of his environmental allergies (dust, pollen, pet dander, etc etc etc) he is probably allergic to preservatives and additives in foods which are causing stomach issues that he\'s had all his life. </P> <P>The allergist said he has to eat all organic, free-range, eliminate all pre-packaged foods with additives and preservatives for 2 weeks to see what happens.</P> <P>Anyway, the reason I\'m posting is just to say to parents of spectrum children (not necessarily yours) that their stomach issues on top of the neurological processing can sometimes make it really difficult or even impossible to potty train on a typical schedule.</P> <P>Our son, thank goodness, is much better off than his father, probably because of all the therapies he\'s been getting. Because his low tone is mostly in his upper torso, he potty trained himself at 3 1/2.</P> <P>Anyway, you have great re paur with your son.

'I agree with having a safe area where the child can just calm down and is <br />not required to stay in a chair. Our behavior analyst also taught us that <br />time out doesn\'t have to be a place. The term Time Out is actually short <br />for Time out from reinforcement. So basically when giving a child a time <br />out, you really just want to withhold access to preferred items for a set <br />period of time (typically only needs to be 1 to 5 minutes or until the child <br />is calm). This can occur in a place, room, chair, etc the whole point of <br />time out though is to show the child that what they did was not <br />acceptable so they are not allowed to have access to preferred items. <br /> <br />When it comes to most everything that I needed help with for our <br />daughter, but especially tantrums and behaviors I wanted to decrease, our <br />behavior analyst always saves the day. She is able to determine why my <br />daughter is doing the behavior and what skills she needs to learn to stop <br />or replace the behavior.

'Fred, is your wife working from home? <br>I\'ve gotten the same: are we going to talk about this EVERY DAY? question from DH. <br>I think there are different philosophical approaches to this-and it\'s hard to call one right or wrong. Your wife might think there\'s not much wrong with your children and that they\'ll be okay and why should your lives be turned upside down for an incurable illness that is not going away any time soon and is not affecting them too badly. <br>You seem fixated on fixing it. Me too. I\'ve spent the last year trying to cure autism. I\'ve exhausted myself and neglected my other family members. Speaking from experience, that was not wise on my part. Not taking care of yourself, bad idea. Not taking care of your spouse, bad idea. Not taking care of your other children, bad idea. <br>I do not think you\'re going to convert your wife in the short term. Let her cope with this at her own pace. I think pushing her is going to backfire. <br>Don\'t do the leave of absence-you\'re trying to sprint a marathon-slow down. We could all do so much more, but doing too much also has its costs. I am supposed to be trying to maximize the quality of life of my entire family that includes myself-this just cannot be about one family member.<br>I wish I could tell you that you can do it all-but you cannot-and the good news is that even though it feels bad, it\'s okay. You need to keep the balance in your family, with your wife-you need to back off from converting her and be there for her and her struggles with this herself. You need to respect her need NOT to talk about it sometimes.<br>Anyway, I\'m no Dr Phil so what do I know, but I guess you remind me of myself and I know the pitfalls of thinking that if you just do your best and do everything you can, everything will be okay-well, sort of-but there\'s a point at which it is up to the children to meet you halfway and there is just the disability itself which you can remediate, but cannot exactly fix. I\'m not saying don\'t try-I\'m saying don\'t burn out. On some level, even though I get annoyed that DH is not trying to fix this, like me, I do think that he grounds me when I\'m getting over fixated on autism and that is a good thing.

I usually let him choose his seat if it is just the two of us, but with his brother, I need to keep them near me. So usually, he really likes the bus and is great. But man, when I told him where he had to sit that day, he just exploded. I had to pick him up kicking and screaming and force him into a seat-which of course did not work very well. I kept explaining to him the reasons, but it took almost 15 minutes to get him to calm down. I actually considered giving in, but I thought it was a bad precedent to set and I knew how tough it would be on the bus if I had to haul two little ones off the bus from two locations! It is like walking on eggshells and when these things happen in public-people think I\'m some overreacting mother being harsh to her son, when they do not realise that if I do not nip the behavior in the bud, the consequences are huge. It is walking on eggshells. We used to have battles over which side of the minivan I opened first-until one day, I just said, \"You know what, Mamma decides which door to open first, not you, Mamma\'s the boss.\" And then of course, chaos erupted, but the next time, he knew that I just wasn\'t going to negotiate that one anymore. It\'s really hard though because to teach something like that, at least with my son, you have to be prepared for utter rebellion before it sinks in and depending on how much reserve you have that day-it may or may not be possible to cope with the additional stress. My husband thinks I never should give into my son\'s demands, but teach him instead. Well, anyone who would spend all day with an autistic child knows that you cannot pick 100% of every day\'s battles or you\'re battling all day. Okay, I\'m rambling on and on! I know how you feel. <br />Nowwhat'
'<P>I am a 51 yeold old women and tested positive for the MTHFR Gene A12098/T677C. I lived the horrors of this undetected mutation starting at the age of 44. My entire endocrinology system fell apart, my thyroid was removed and I had internal toxcicity to my liver, gallbladder, pancreas, high insulin levels, reneal failure, hormonal disruption and leaky gut, MS symptoms and vertigo! I was repaired by functional medicine and/or intergrative medicine in 2006-2007. In April 2009 I was diagnosed with the MTHFR Gene. My younder son (age 20) was diagnosed in March of 2010 due to depression and ADD symptoms. My older son (age 26) is in the process of being tested. We are waiting for results at the present time. He was considered developmentally disabled since having an MMR age the age of 2 1/2 years of age. </P> <P> Much of this is caused by vaccinations! We all now have medical expemptions from our doctors. We do not VACCINATE anyone in our families anymore! The gene is the gun and the bullets to the gun are toxins! The mercury in vaccinations are a direct hit to the blood stream and cause the majority of the damage. Watch <A href=\"http://www.mercurypoisened.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.mercurypoisened.com</A> to learn the horrors of mercuyr in teeth, vaccinations etc... We cannot have any metal in our bodies and/or teeth! </P> <P>You should look at You Tube at search Dr. Stephen Smith, Richland WA \"MTHFR and Fibromyalsia. Also, look at his website <A href=\"http://www.nwhealthcare.net\" target=\"_blank\">www.nwhealthcare.net</A> and search MTHFR. Read the page and then click on the titles in brown which will pull up grids on MTHFR Treatment and MTHFR Diseases. then watch the lecture series by Dr. Neil Rawlins -OBGYN (Richland, WA) . There is a protocol for MTHFR that has worked well for myself and my children. Both of these doctors have the MTHFR gene mutations as well as their families. Google Dr. Neil Rawlins and you can read his story about what he went through with his son and MTHFR. </P> <P>If you google Pam Labs out of Lousiana you can read about the prescription food supplements (Deplin, Metanx and Cerefolin NAC) that help at least 98% of the people who have MTHFR as well as Dr. Rawlins Protocol. </P> <P>all of this information is for you to research and take to your doctor to help them put a face to MTHFR. I would not start this protocol without a doctor even if it seen simple. This is because the level of eveyone\'s toxcicity level is different! </P> <P> </P> <P>May God bless you on your journey! </P> <P>PS. For a fee Dr. Stephen Smith will call you and help you get with the correct people in your area or he can possibly treat you. </P> <P> </P> <P> </P>'

I\'m <br />okay with them messing up in their supports initially, and then having to <br />adjust when his behaviour demands it. However, what I\'m not okay with <br />is them messing up in their supports, and then, instead of fixing the <br />supports, them blaming it all on Donny and winding up restraining him <br />every day (which is how things have gone so far). <br /> <br />I have a report with recommendations from Don\'s psychologist, and a <br />basic report from his neuropsych - the school has a copy of each. They <br />also have a signed release to contact the neuropsych to discuss Donny. <br />And Donny\'s Dr. has signed off on the restraints and safety plan. <br /> <br />I don\'t know, I get a lot of folks (generally parents of typical kids, or <br />people who don\'t understand disabilities, such as Don\'s family doc) who <br />seem to be on the school\'s side, in regards to restraints. But I\'m just <br />soooo tired of that being the answer for everything. <br /> <br />It\'s like: <br /> <br />\"he\'s not listening\" - BAM! Let\'s pin him down <br />\"he\'s yelling because he\'s angry that his needs weren\'t met\" - BAM! let\'s <br />pin him down! <br />\"Donny\'s not doing his work\" - Let\'s pin him down! <br /> <br />The TAs even say that what happens is he wants to do (or doesn\'t want to <br />do something), they have things that need to be done, they insist on their <br />agenda, he won\'t comply, they either physically force him (by moving him <br />where they want him and/or blocking his access) which leads directly to <br />restraint, or they pressure him until he lashes out, at which point they <br />restrain him. I can\'t seem to get them to understand that this is not the <br />answer. That they are there for him, and that, if he is insisting on doing <br />or not doing something, he\'s <strong>communicating</strong>, and that they should <br />try to work with that, instead of just ignoring it. <br /> <br />Anyway, I\'m rambling...<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Donny 13 - classic autism, bipolar</div>'

'I got the formal evaluation report from Aiden\'s school\'s autism team worker in the mail yesterday, and it literally made me cry.<br><br>She wrote, \"Aiden is aware that he has Asperger\'s Syndrome.

We have told him that he learns and understands things differently than most people, and that his brain works a little differently, but it\'s not a bad thing, because everyone is different in some ways, and because he thinks and learns differently, he\'ll be able to understand and learn some things better and faster than a lot of people, but other things, maybe a little slower. We also told him that it means that even though he can learn things like math and reading super-quick, he has to work extra hard at learning how to deal with things like his feelings when he\'s mad or sad, but life is all about learning. It\'d be boring if you ran out of things to learn.<br><br>I asked Aiden again what it means, and he said exactly what he told the autism team worker.

'<P>For those with children under the age of 14, it doesn\'t pay to worry about adult services yet. Things will change A LOT by the time your children qualify for adult services at age 18. And, in order to qualify, the child MUST have an IQ of 59 or lower or a Vineland of 69 or lower. For those whose kids are higher functioning, adult services are not available. Now, remember, an Asperger\'s individual with a gifted IQ COULD have a Vineland as low as 69. However, that doesn\'t often happen. EVERY child with an IEP qualifies for Transition services paid for by the School District, though. IDEA 2004 has strengthened the school district responsibility in this area. An IEP MUST include a transition plan once a student reaches age 16 (lower in some states) and CAN include a transition plan as early as age 12. </P> <P>VCuddy - I wish I could be your advocate, but I live 3,000 miles away. Try hard to find an advocate in California. You must work on where your son will be and what he will be doing in July of 2009. There IS support out there.

'I think generally kids do not like jeans, they are not comfortable at all and these new skinny ones are terrible as well. I do not have sensory issues but some of my jeans can be quite uncomfortable...'
'I dislike it too, not because of who is shown, but because of how they describe them. Same reasons for the propaganda too, as someone else said. There was already a murder of an autistic girl where they used this video to try to get sympathy for the killer. (In fact there were three or four murders just a week or two after it came out.) The right to say whatever you are feeling, comes with the responsibility to do it responsibly, and I don\'t think this video was remotely responsible. They also deliberately downplayed most of the good points (and you could see, in the videos, that there were good points).<br> <br> Of course, to put this in perspective, I come from a disability rights background, where both pity-mongering and perpetuation of stereotypes of disabled people as burdens on our families are heavily frowned upon. This video was not put out so that parents would identify with it, it was put out to manipulate the emotions of the general public. The way it was put together, both as visible inside the film and as described by the people who made it, both show that.<br> <br> Again, I have no problem with showing the particular autistic people in the film. I have a real problem with how they were described, and the form the editing took for maximum emotional manipulation. When I made my website, I deliberately made it in the style of films like this (this one was not out yet, but there are plenty of others) because I wanted to show how <em>anyone\'s</em> life can be misdepicted in a medicalized and sensationalist way. (Then I spent the second half of the website picking apart such misdepictions.) As in, taking real facts, but then adding a lot of outside judgement and warping them from a medical/tragedy/burden perspective of disability. Disabled people (severely disabled and otherwise) have been similarly picking apart such depictions for decades, because they do a lot of harm to us in our everyday lives, including both how the general public and our loved ones are encouraged to view us, and including the value of our lives themselves.<br> <span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by gtto on November 14 2006 at 1:31pm</span>'

'<P>My son has had issues hitting, he has for about....3 years now I guess. We just keep modeling appropriate behavior. Help by giving him the words to express his emotions, we started doing that long before his diagnoses and kept doing it after, he used to hit us or himself upwards of 50 times a day I would say at its worst, now its down to maybe once every two weeks. </P> <P>I have been hit, kicked, punched, bitten, scratched, so has his ST,OT,PT, TSS ...everyone who has at one point on another put demands on him. The worse was one time he hit me in the head with a hammer. - I know that all sounds terrible, but honestly, in comparison to some of the other kiddos with ASD I know, he is on the mild side. I\'m sort of thankful he only lashes out at people putting demands on him, he has never hit a peer or anything (one of the kids in our support group choked his one classmate <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley19.gif\" border=\"0\">- I feel so bad for his mama) </P> <P> </P> <P>Anyway this is an example of what we do:</P> <P>Ewan is drawing and I want him to stop, I ask him, when he doesn\'t I do hand-over-hand to help him put the markers down, in response he hits me with the notebook.</P> <P>I then go hand over hand again, so he cannot hit me, and I say \"Ewan did that make you sad or mad when mommy asked you to stop?\" I pause and see if he will respond sometimes he does sometimes he doesn\'t. Then I say \"It is okay to be mad about that, you can even say \"Mommy that makes me MAD\" (and here I do a mad face) can you try that?\" Again I wait for a response, by now he normally says \"Mommy that made me MAD\" or sometimes he even adds to it, about what specifically made him mad. Then I say \"That is okay, it is okay to be mad, but when you are mad you have to use your words not hit. Hitting isn\'t okay. Now you have to go to a time-out because you hit. You can be mad, but you cannot hit.\" </P> <P> </P> <P>Now this works for my son, but he is very high-functioning, also like I said this is the method we did long before we had any clue what we were doing. I\'m sure someone else will have a better way to handle it, but basically I think the main thing is to reinforce that the feelings he has aren\'t wrong, but his actions are, and find a better way to express that. And I wanted to let you know that you weren\'t alone with the hitting. </P>'

'<P>Hi All,</P> <P>I\'m here primarily because I was looking for an update on the family\'s boy who is missing in Saratoga. Our family is sick over this also, as our son is 7...has wandered...and the feeling inside is indescribable. We too live in the woods in a rural area near water. Last year we thought our son was in our yard as we have a ritual of yelling to him....\"Finn, where are you?!?\" and he yells back...\"Where are you I\'m in the woods!!!\". That satisfied us knowing he wasn\'t too far away and we could hear him. It seemed to work for a couple of months as we had practiced this vigilantly with him as a therapy program. Then in an instant he was not answering. We were frantic and five minutes later our senior therapist who was arriving to our home, found our little boy huddled like a mushroom in the middle of the road near the corner. My heart still jumps to my throat remembering that day. This all hits home for us because we all know how quickly things can change and we have no idea what it is in their mind from one moment to another that might motivate them to venture away. For what it is worth, a lot of people are praying for all of you and especially for the well being of your precious little boy.</P> <P>It\'s late. I can\'t sleep as it was a pretty rough day today with a number of meltdowns, kids fighting, things escalating resulting in my little guy stabbing me in the back with a pen while I was trying to intervene with my oldest, newly teenaged boy and his attitude. No skin broken. It was a pen. I\'m still reeling here wondering what might have happened if it had been a knife. These things don\'t happen often, but in my exhaustion, the grief I\'m feeling because I can never let down my guard, especially now on my back side. I thought I was always cautiously and vehemently prepared for any attack...unconciously always ready...How can this happen as this is the sweetest, most loving, beautiful boy one could know? How can I ever prepare another caregiver or babysitter when I can\'t even be prepared? Is it only just by the grace of God, that no one was hurt today? At least physically? I need a break obviously. I actually have a young woman who wants to help us out, but again...having to explain every nuance of any possible situation that MIGHT set off a behavior for every new person that enters our life...it\'s tiring, exhausting and how do I know if I\'ve left something out? Here again, I\'m not prepared. And the thought of...\"oh yeah, and he might stab you...\" \"Oh okay!?\", with the look in her eyes, of what the heck have I done here signing up for this? Why would she want to help us out? Okay, can you tell we\'ve gone post-intensive? That\'s a funny term. When did we leave the intensive? Today was pretty intense. School is out. Structure is gone. June is tough. July will be busy and I was actually hoping for a calmer, just hanging out kinda month to catch up with my kids. All of us were spent by noon today. Except for Finn. He did what he needed to do to get through it all, coming full circle into his feelings, identifying them in his perseverating way, apologizing, chilling out by himself, coming back for a snuggle and ready to create his, rather my, next challenge. I\'m not asking for advice, because I know all the things I can and will do to help. Frankly, today...actually at 3:30 AM, I just don\'t want to. I\'m feeling resentful, lost, sad and can\'t cry, scared for his future because I can\'t die, and so helpless to see him independent in the future. All this work and where will it lead him? Everyone on the outside says...how severe is his autism? \"Well, apparently, he\'s high functioning!\" is my response. That\'s what the experts tell me... Well, I\'m not! What does that mean? High-functioning means that he\'s smart enough to stab you because he\'s aware enough of his surroundings that he knows he\'s upset, yet he doesn\'t have any impulse control and then he feels somewhat sorry, though ultimately he can\'t control himself and could be a danger to others and himself? Is that high-functioning? All in a day, the labels don\'t mean much. Today I was actually able to tap into my grief. So were my other kids. They just wanted out. And they had no where else to go because today they were in their grief and no activity, friend, distraction can truly carry us out of Finn\'s world. We are all deeply affected. Each moment. Every day. Now that I\'ve vented, I need to go count my blessings and some sheep so I CAN be prepared for tomorrow. Hopefully this is the place for me. Thanks.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Laura</div>'

'<P>Wow - thanks for all the words, folks. I\'ve read each reply and appreciate all of your valuable insights and suggestions. It\'s a tough decision, and we\'ll make it together after hearing the recommendations from the Lovaas folks. That should happen in about a week after they have a meeting with their director. I\'m very interested to hear their recommendations. </P> <P>I\'ll be sure to update this thread or start a new one with their recommendations, because this question is asked many times on the board - you know, is an intense ABA program appropriate for a child who has functional language, emerging social skills and only mild behavioral issues.</P> <P>jdecina - yes, you\'re correct. I have an ABA tutor working with the girls currently. She\'s been on board for three weeks, and has primarily been pairing with the girls, and not making too many demands on them just yet (though she does slip in \"work\", even though the girls don\'t know it). I hired her knowing that for the first several weeks she\'d be just bonding with the girls, and during that time, we\'d figure out goals and curriculum, etc. She comes in about 12-15 hours/week. Oh, she gave us the HELP charts, too :)</P> <P>The Lovaas folks would be overseeing the program, but she\'d still be on board, delviering the therapy. The Lovaas folks would devise the curriculum provide training for all of us, and then monthly consults. The additional costs for the Lovaas folks would be about $2400 for initial training, 200-400 month for consultations, and I think they\'d also want us to increase therapy hours, which would mean, probably, an additional therapist, probably a student, so probably 10/hour for however many extra hours they recommend.</P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by fred on April 21 2007 at 8:42pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Father of five year old autistic twin girls and a seven year old son.</div>'

'<P>OMG, I thought you were describing my daughter Morgan! SHe is 6, and when she started babbling as a toddler, she talked alot, even though it was mostly to herself. Now she sings alot and has alot of great spontanous talk, though she doesnt answer direct questions very well or have conversations.</P> <P>Morgan acted like a dog, cat, scooby doo (that one was really bad, it started to drive us crazy), birds off movies, etc. She has a wonderful imagination and its really funny watching her. People at the store would talk to her and she would pant, bark, growl, hiss, etc, depending on what animal she was that month. She would purr and lick our faces, and she would try to bite us. She still acts like animals alot, but has toned it down alot.</P> <P>She is really into singing, though its really hard to understand sometimes, but she loves it and gets dancing, etc, its great. We taught her how to talk by using songs and rhymes. </P> <P>She has alot of sensory issues, extreme fears, problems telling imagination from reality. Its gotten better, we are albe to see her geting worked up and soothe her. There was a time when that was impossible, but its gotten easier.</P> <P>She just outright ignores people, animals, toys, etc. If she wants to acknowledge you, she will, otherwise you dont exist. I had to teach her to love her baby doll and hold it, etc. She would pick it up, look at it, and set it down. She liked anything that lights up. She has 2 doll houses and uses them as storage for her little trinkets. She lines everything in the doll house and tosses the dolls and furniture into a box, lol. She has little purses and treasure boxes to carry around with her trinkets. When we get somewhere, she finds a little place to hide, under a chair w/blanket, under a table with all the chairs pulled in,etc. Then she sets up her little trinkets, usually in a line, or a series of lines, and just looks at them.</P> <P>She is a nester. She gets everything she can and makes a nest/fort type thing to hang out in. You can usually just see her little face sticking out. She likes to gather all her favorite toys, dolls, etc and leave them on her bed. She doesnt actually play with these toys, they just have to stay on her bed. She then sleeps in that mess. If I move stuff, she gets really upset, gathers it and places it back in the same spots. We just sold our large suv, she would sit in the very back seat, arrange her things, and not say a word for hours on long trips. Now she has to sit in the same seat near her baby brother and he disrupts her little toy arrangement, it gets her very upset. The list goes on and on. She is pretty easy to deal with at home as long as everything goes smoothly, but not in public. Her fears and sensory issues take over, it is getting better. </P> <P>She was dx late. We were told by drs that she was \'eccentric\', etc. We had her speech tested at age 3 1/2 and the teacher said she needed to be better disciplined. That teacher has since expressed her apologies. But we had a few years of pure he** wondering what we were doing wrong, why was she doing this, etc.</P> <P> </P> <P> </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Jana</div>'

Make sure she is looking into your eyes, not your chest or shirt or your body. Most children with autism are still attached to parents and like to laugh and play with them to some extent.

'He sounds like my Andrew! He\'s still not potty trained, for him it is mainly sensory. He too screams when you change his diaper, its the feel of the wipe, that risidue of wetness, hates it. He is worse at school because they insist on changing him in the bathroom and he is afraid of the toilet.It has taken me a long time to figure this out. And for him its the big scary toilet he doesn\'t like. So, I have gotten his favorite books to read, stickers, chocolate, essentially I bribe him and I distract him. THat gets us through the diaper changes, also I kept changing wipes until I found something he would tolerate. And also has gotten him on the toilet. What are some of his favorite things? They put a poster of animals on the wall for Nikolas, and he sat on the potty and named the animals. For andrew they decorated the walls with scooby doo. They sit them on the toilet at the same time every day, pretty much a potty schedule. At home I had a chocolate bowl, and they got one chocolate for just sitting on the potty, 2 if they actually went, plus they got to go through the cheap sticker book from walmart and pick a couple of stickers. I have read books to them on the toilet, when Nikolas was withholding BMs that is how I got him to go, I would read his favorite story twice and he would go without even realizing it until it was over. Also I never really pushed. Nikolas trained in like 2 weeks once he got the idea, Andrew still has never actually gone on the potty, although we are getting closer and closer, but he is afraid of the toilet and its obvious. The other thing with Nikolas once he went I took away the diaper. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Linda, Mommy to 7 y.o. twins, Nikolas pdd-nos and Andrew, SID and apraxia and Ember, NT, 5 years old</div>'

Sure enough it is something that came out of it\'s package and small enough he can swallow since he is already trying to eat everything he gets his hands on and even stuff he is not suppose to eat. Well i pick the stuff up and he is screaming literally screaming at me i look at him and say what\'s wrong and he was screaming louder. I don\'t understand it i then told him not to kick the wall after that but he doesnt understand and he just screams louder. i said it nicely to him and i didnt make a big deal. I walk out of the room again and he calms down i walk back in he starts freaking out screaming. what can i do for him now he just is throwing major tantrums ever since that happened and i feel like i am gonna go nuts...<div class=\'post_sig\'>- Nicole  little nicole (2 yrs 9 mos) 1-15-04 (autism dx 3-15-06)    little Joe (20 mos) 2-25-05 (some motor problems) possible sensory issues may be on spectrum</div>'

'<P><FONT size=2>I posted some of the floortime techniques earlier this month. If you want I can search for it. Usually, you just need to relax and follow your child\'s lead and then begin changing the way you relate. Stop asking so many questions or trying to lead (that\'s usually the biggest problem for me). You don\'t need to teach. Follow your child\'s lead even if that means joining in with her stims. Find ways to make her laugh and wait for her to respond with eye contact or verbalization. Then do it again and change it up. Sensory motor play is the best place to start. Bouncing, dancing, blowing bubbles, etc.</FONT></P> <P> </P>'

'That really is a tough one, I know my H doesn\'t have the patience either, but I refuse to allow any spanking of the children. You were protecting your disabled child and if he wants to discuss parenting issues away from the children he should also learn how to control his temper. Nothing is gained from spanking but low self esteem, and resentment. The effects on an NT child let alone a child with Autism is pretty great. Did you try to talk to him about this once the children were in bed? I can only imagine the stress this has put on you, trying to care for an infant and at the same time having to step in to defend your other child. It\'s one thing to have disapline, but when you cross that line and get out of control, that\'s when it\'s a problem. I would seriously put my foot down and give your DH an ultimatum. If he can\'t patiently work with your child and understand the struggles she is already going through, you\'ll be forced to step in and remove your child from the situation. I know some parents think corporal punishment is necessary, but in my eyes I can only see that as child abuse.

Make sure he knows on Saturday after lunch we are going to aunt susies to see the baby. You can take your favorite toy or video game or movie with you. Tell him what to expect, remind him and reinforce it. Maybe tell him if he doesnt hurt the baby you will get ice cream on the way home or he can pick what he wants for dinner or you will take him to the park on the way hme or something he enjoys as a small reward, but consistently remind him frequently, especially when you see him getting a little ansey.

I didn\'t even think about if the OP knew that or not. They don\'t really do therapy. They see what\'s going on with the kiddo this week, how last week went, and then teach you how to do the therapies yourself at home. The only person that actually \"did therapy\" with our younger son was the counselor that was doing floortime. He came for an hour and spent 45 minutes with him interacting and 10 minutes explaining what I should do that week. He only got 1 hour of floortime each week, which was not enough IMO. The \"downside\" of EI is that they can\'t take into account that parents can\'t spend 20 hours each week many times doing one on one ABA/Floortime, another 5 hours with speech, and 2 hours with OT practices because they do have other children many times that need some of their time and attention. You have to be able to balance it all. This isn\'t a dog on EI. It\'s the nature of their services, what they are designed for. This is why I said \"can\'t take into account\". They simply teach you what to do, support you in it, and then you have to be able to make the time, the place, and the balance to do the therapy on your own each day/week. </P> <P>With private we still had to do things at home, but it wasn\'t as intense time-wise because of what we got during therapy. Of course, the downside there was that we had to be at the center 4 days each week for a few hours each day. So, it\'s all a trade off. </P>'
'We have done RDI for a few years now. It is nothing like floortime...it is very deliberate in the objectives the consultant gives you to work on with your son...But the GREATEST thing I got from RDI is how it made me who I am today when interacting with my son. I look at Autism so differently now, and I see how the little things we worked on made HUGE impacts on our son. DO IT! Yes, it\'s expensive, but so is private school ABA, college, blah blah blah.

'Have any of you ever considered that as parents we develop some of the autistic symptoms ourselves. The sensory in peticular. I cried so much over the years that I eventually developed a shell around that part of my life. I simply could not cry anymore. I also went through a time when I had my, what called, mini breakdown, where I would cry a few seconds then get up and start life over. It was a beautiful day when my daughter found me on one of these bouts. She held me as if I were a child and rocked me, saying soothing words, that quiet frankly I shoved back at her. She being the angel that she is realized that \"mom\" was simply having a melt down and had to say the things she said. I think that day brought forth a much closer relationship with her.

My first thought was \"Who do I kill first?\" Which was always a joke and only a release so that I could laugh a bit before going back to tears. I was told to get away from a weekend and relax.

'<P>Linda,</P> <P>My son is different (i.e. \"more autistic\") at school than home as well. Apparently this is quite typical based on many of the posts I\'ve read in other threads on this board. School puts much more stress and demands on our children than we do at home. Some of the stress is environmental - sheer number of kids, number of transitions. In addition, kids are being pushed to do new and novel tasks and there is so much language! We all, whether consciously or unconsciously, have adapted our own behavior at home to get the best out of our children. What really brought this home it me is watching C\'s twin interact with him. R has unconsciously started to model the way that my dh and I interact with C. R will ask C a question, if C doesn\'t respond, R will walk over to him and say \"look at me\" and then repeat the question. R interacts with his brother differently than he does his NT buddies, and he got that from us.</P> <P>I would highly recommend that you not only observe any special ed options, but you observe a regular class and observe your boys in their current placement. We\'ve done this over the past few weeks and it helped tremendously. When I observed C in his current mainstream kindergarten I saw exactly what the school team was talking about. </P> <P>I can give you the long litany of tests the did on C to come to an educational autism diagnosis if you\'re interested. Feel free to PM me.</P> <P> </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Kristy  Mom to 10 year old twin boys (1 PDD-NOS, 1 ADHD)</div>'

'<P><strong><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2> I have a question about seizures for those of you who have kids who have them or know anything about them, Nick who is autistic has never had one so far, but his little sis who is NT as far as we can tell (she is 3.5) has always had a problem with holding her breath and passing out when she is upset. She has done this since she was about a year old, Some times she just holds it long enough to start to turn purple and other times she actually passes out and then starts breathing again. Well a couple of times when she has done this her eyes have rolled to the back of her head she turns a greyish blue color her back arches and her body stiffens and she also loses bodily functions both urine and bowel. Is this just passing out from holding her breath or is she having some form of seizure?? This is very scary and I was telling a friend of the family who is an RN and she told me that I should consult her doctor and have her refer us to a Nuero for an EEG. Now that I think about it with her brother having a Nuerological disorder she is a prime canidate also. I have always looked for signs of autism or pdd with her but never thought of seizures because Nick hasn\'t had any troubles with them. If it helps any most of the time she has done this she is extrememly over tired, over heated and upset about something. If any of you have children who have seizures could you tell me what happens during a seizure?? I haven\'t ever witnessed a seizure and I am scared to death.

'They are different, but not so much so that you really need to get caught up in what she\'s labeled. They have their similarities as well. Asperger\'s and PDD-NOS are both on the higher end of the spectrum. Generally speaking Asperger\'s is at the top of the spectrum and PDD-NOS is one rung below it. And there is a bit of an overlap because personality and individuality come into play and can make an accurate diagnosis difficult. In other words, while the two have different defining characteristics, each child/case is different, and there is no definitive line between the bottom of Asperger\'s and the top of PDD-NOS. So that means that there will be cases where the two side by side will appear similar, if not indistinguishable, and yet other times where the difference is obvious when two children are placed next to each other. <br /> <br />I really wouldn\'t worry so much about the label if I were you. In my opinion, if Abby is on the spectrum that\'s really all you neeed to know. From there it\'s just a matter of getting to know what her individual needs are and stacking that up to what you know about autism spectrum disorders in general. If you do that you\'ll be able to help her. <br /> <br />Best of luck. <div class=\'post_sig\'>-   ~Nick   Still in touch with my inner child ;)</div>'

For example, if a door that is normally shut is open (like a closet door) she must shut it, same with toilet lids. I\'ve never had to buy toilet lock yet (even though she LOVES water) b/c she is so insistent on slamming them shut! Also routines, like one day we pulled in the driveway right as her OT was pulling in. We all went in the front door instead of through the garage like I usually do. Well, she freaked out for 15 minutes banging on the door that leads to the garage and crying and throwing her body onto the floor, all b/c we didn\'t come in the house the usual way. There are some things that we give in to, like the toilet and door closing (what\'s it going to hurt?) but with the routines, I really try to \"nip it in the bud\" and not give in to her. That day with the garage, the OT told me that it would be the worst mistake EVER for me to go out and come back in again, b/c she would learn that if she pitches a fit, she gets her routine. Well, we didn\'t, and it only took her 15 minutes to calm down and forget about it (15 LOUD minutes!<IMG src=\"smileys/smiley2.gif\" border=\"0\">).</FONT></P> <P><FONT face=Arial size=3>I guess you have to decide if this is something that you want to continue to have as a habit (carrying a blankie) or if you want to \"nip it in the bud\" so to speak before it gets to be a worse obsession. Your OT can probably help you in this area. I think our kids can break their obsessions with the right direction and enough time and consistency, it just takes longer than with NT children. I do believe it\'s very important not to give in to that rigidity - I\'m always switching things up now!</FONT></P>'

'<P>Hi all. Well I am just kind of frustrated right now. I just started having an ABA therapist come out for my son,which I was really excited about, but now I am just confused. I know that part of the ABA therapy is teaching the parents how to do it on their own, but is that the main thing the therapist does? The therapist has been out a few times now and she has just been teaching me how to do the ABA therapy, but she has not really been working with my son...The problem is just that I dont think I am cut out to do the ABA therapy.. I know it sounds bad, but I really dont think I have the patience and I dont think my son will benefit from me trying to do the therapy with him. I know that alot of people will hire a team to do the ABA therapy and then just have it overseen by the BCBA, but we cant afford that. The only way we are able to get the ABA therapist at all is because Tricare pays for it.. But they wont pay for anyone besides the BCBA so I cant just go find someone else to help me do the therapy.. Anyway, I am just frustrated. I feel like trying to do this on my own is pointless.. Not to mention I work from home as an MT, and I just dont really have the time. Anyway, I just am not sure if I should even have the therapist keep coming.. I just dont see how I can get anywhere with my son on my own.. Anyway, just wanted to vent a little. Thanks all for listening.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- My autism awareness items   http://members.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewUserPage&userid =jen25nc    Mom to Zachary, 5, ASD and Elizabeth 7 months</div>'

'<P>Shelley. Theabove posters gave some great advice. I really think you can do it yourself. Our ABA had parent training as mandatory. (My husband loved that!) I feel confident enough to run programs. I\'m sure from all that you have said, you could probably do just as good of a job as the therapists. I like the way other folks suggested you have them train you or another (cheaper) therapist to do it. </P>'
'<P>Hi everyone,</P> <P>My 4 yo ds has spent the last year since his pdd-nos dx (at age 3) in a special ed program with outside ABA and OT. He is making a ton of progress- especially in his language although he still has a ways to go in his expressive communication (still no WHY questions, confusing pronouns, etc). His language is probably equivalent to a 2.5 year old- he is due to get retested by this dev ped in March.</P> <P>With all of the gains he is making, Im still not seeing movement in the social skills arena. While ds has gotten to the point where he can tolerate other kids in his space (I know this is a good thing), he still has no interest in engaging peers. He will engage adults that he knows and feels comfortable with (family, teachers, therapists, etc) and is a happy kid in general. Hes reading at a first grade level (hyperlexia?) and is really smart.</P> <P>I am hopeful that his language will continue to progress but I am constantly worried that the desire to be \"social\" with other kids wont ever come. I dream about the day that ds spontaneously speaks to another child. We do everything possible to encourage this (ie prompting him at every opportunity to engage others) and I know his teachers are working on this with him in school too. </P> <P>I also have a 10 mo who really tries to get in ds\'s space as much as possible, which is great. Im hoping that as she gets older, she\'ll be a great peer for him to practice on!</P> <P>For those of you with kids that do communicate regularly with other children and even have friends- can you share with me how this came about? Did one day your dc just engage another kid and things kept improving from that point? Of course every kid is different but I just cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel in this area. Id love to hear your stories- especially from those of you that never thought youd see the day where your child spoke to and played with another child!</P> <P> </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Tkny12  Mom to adorable Ryan (3.5 yo pdd-nos) and beautiful dd (5 months, fingers crossed ;)</div>'
'Thanks for bumping this...I was going to come back...but then had to deal with ds tonight. <br><br>Here are other things he has done that is odd.<br><br>He uses pencils and puts holes in his wall...over and over till they get bigger and bigger. He used to chew on the front of his shirt in class...till I had to throw them out because they were all chewed up. He finally got through that stage, but still cuts his clothes and sheets and blankets. He can\'t bare to let me throw anything away...even clothes that he can no longer wear. I was tossing a comforter that was 20 years old..and was a ball of mess after it got washed and dryed...and he got upset and cut a piece of it to \"remember\" it by. <br><br>More recently he has gotten the compass needles and was sticking them in his head...having them stick there by themselves...till taken away by teachers. He was/is obsessed with water bottles and soda bottles...still is...but we\'ve managed to curb that a bit by locking up the cabinets where they are located...otherwise his room is filled with the plastic bottles. He found a container with straight pins...and took them to school...and had them in his mouth....got notes from a few teachers about this. The playing with the water bottles was so bad...that teachers were sending him out of the class..because he wouldn\'t leave them alone and it was too distracting for the other students. He is already in sp. ed. btw.<br><br>Hygiene...if we don\'t make him and make sure he\'s taking a bath..he won\'t take one. He is getting some kind of allergy problem...we haven\'t figured out what he\'s getting into that\'s causing it...we think it\'s because he\'s putting on something...and then laying in his bed with it....since most of the area is on his upper chest and back. We\'re not sure though.<br><br>He also has a problem with matches...for instance....he has struck 20 off ...in his bedroom...thank goodness we have smoke detectors in each room...and we knew that it was his room it originated in...even if he said it wasn\'t ...as his room was filled with smoke...and none of the others were. This has happened several times...so the garage is locked practically 24/7...but there have been times that someone will forget and leave the door unlocked by mistake. When that happens....we have to search his room to figure out what he\'s taken...that he shouldn\'t have gotten....like matches. <br><br>He has always had problems making friends with kids his own age. Usually his friends are 3 or 4 or more years younger than him....and he does well with that age. Kids his own age...tend to stay clear of him. One kid that knows ds...said he\'s loud...and that everytime ds sees him...he laughs about the time that this kid bumped into his leg brace.<br><br>Oh my...can\'t forget this...jokes....he doesn\'t \"get\" jokes...can\'t tell them either. He\'ll laugh his head off...but doesn\'t understand why or what makes them funny. he just laughes because someone says it\'s a joke.<br><br>I remember when he was really young...and he would do something wrong..and I would say to him \"why did you do that?\" and his answer was..\"I don\'t know\"...and I would ask him \"what did you do that was wrong?\" and he would say \"because it was wrong\". I just figured he didn\'t understand what I was trying to say....but perhaps it\'s the way their brain is made ...I don\'t know...but he\'s never really \"understood\" things. Now when confronted with his behavior...he will deny doing it or act like he has no remorse or doesn\'t understand why what he did was wrong...or why he \"had\" to do what he did.<br><br>His handwriting is that of a 1st grader....or doctor...you take a pick. He can\'t form what is in his head to paper....at least not where you can make any sense of it. However...he has a vivid imagination.<br><br>There\'s more...but not sure if they are part of why he is the way he is or not.<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Diane-18 yr just dx with PDD/aspergers last year   ww.cjkeepmeinstyle.etsy.com</div>'
'GReat idea. I think of autism as a radio that\'s not on the station quite right. Sometimes the reception is perfectly clear. SOmetimes all you get is static. I think your systems show that 100%. Hopefully, this will give DH a better idea of what autism is like.'
'Welcome!! I too am from Nevada..the Las Vegas/Henderson area. It\'s funny, because we have been working with NEIS for almost a year, and seen some progress, but as much as we should have. She goes to OT 2x a week privately, and we are about ready to start private speech therapy as well. The speech therapist also thinks she might possibly have apraxia, but wants to evaluate her more. I have had 3 professionals tell me that she has a speech disorder as well as sensory processing issues and that they don\'t think she\'s asd. She does have an asd diagnosis, which is fine, because now we can qualify for more funding/therapies. Anyway, have you set up with an eval. through the school district yet? If he gets a good placement in school, then he should do great(from what I\'ve heard). Def. continue with the speech therapy. PM me if you are in this area and want to know anymore resources that I might be able to help you with!

'Sounds just like Jacob. He has these even when he takes a nap during the day. Its been going on since he was a baby. We went as far as recording one since they never found anything on his EEG or sleep studies. Its terrible to feel so helpless. When he was a baby it always started with a very irregular breathing pattern. So I would wake him then it would all go down hill from there. Now he lets out a cry I\'ll go in to check on him and hes terrified he doesnt seem to know who I am for a minute. Then the screaming comes. He puts his arms out for me then throws himself back this goes on for a good 25 minutes.'

'Hi,<br><br>Unlike many parents of children with autism, I knew something was different about my son the day I brought him home from the hospital.

'<P>Due to a job loss, my husband is going to home a lot more than normal. He is starting to tease Alex (5yrs hfa) and using mild sarcasm as \"teaching\" tools. I intervene whenever I see it coming, but I am not there 24/7. In the 2.5 years since his initial diagnosis, my husband has done very little to inform himself about the finer points of autism. Like many moms, I have done 98% of the research, therapy, ieps, etc. I know that my husband feels he needs to \"toughen\" Alex up because he will go to kindergarten in the fall. I think it is horrible that he would treat his son that way, even if he has good intentions. I think that home should be a safe place where you are loved and treated with respect. Alex will get plenty of crappy treatment in school, why should he get it at home too?</P> <P>Am I being an overprotective wimp?</P> <P>Suzi T</P>'
'<P>So, I get this note yesterday from my son\'s summer class that they are going swimming tomorrow. He\'s still in pull-ups and the note said they had to wear their swimsuits on the bus. So, I wrote a note to the teacher asking her how she\'d like to do this, plus this park they are going to has water slides and I was concerned about safety issues and said I didn\'t want him on the slides. Well, he gets off the bus and the note is still there in his bag!! I taped it on the outside of his folder plain as day, and now tomorrow he has to go swimming and I\'m gonna be nervous till he comes home. I was thinking of calling the priniciple, but since they are in a different building this year I don\'t know if i can even reach anyone. </P> <P>I\'m trying not to be paranoid here, thinking they\'d have enough common sense knowing they have 12 disabled kids all in a pool near giant slides.

'To clarify, I think it\'s okay to make judgements about other people\'s opinions (i.e. whether the opinions are right, wrong, some combination, both, neither, etc), but a bad idea to judge people - any people, autistic or not - for not <em>padding</em> their opinions with all the social niceties that make <em>some</em> people more likely to see them as \"nice people\". <br> <br> I was responding to someone\'s statement that a couple posters here should cushion their statements. These are not posters I always agree with, but the reason I disagree, when I do, is not because their statements are not cushioned and padded full of \"I am nice\" signals. If I judged people on that basis, I would never be able to write anything, because I am unable to send such signals on command.<br> <br> This doesn\'t mean there\'s <em>no</em> bad ways to communicate (and I\'m seeing people on several sides of things doing <em>that</em> on this thread), just that people shouldn\'t be judged for whether they can cushion their statements or not. (\"Not cushioned\" is not the same thing as \"being mean\".)<br> <br> As far as being given a hard time when I first came - I have not been given much of a hard time since. The only thing that happened was, in my initial posting, people didn\'t believe I existed (one person even claiming that if people like me were not in one specific medical journal then we did not exist), and then in my first posting after that, someone linked back to the thread to tell people to be cautious about me or something. Since then, I\'ve gotten little to no problems of that sort, and a lot of apologies about that.<br> <br> Of course, in any forum that is mostly non-autistic people, there\'s going to be a n inadvertent bias towards communication styles more common in non-autistic people, and that\'s more what I was addressing when I replied to someone\'s statement about people needing to cushion their words. I was not trying to talk about the entire board doing this-or-that though.<br> <span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by gtto on November 12 2006 at 7:30am</span>'

'<P>One other way to go is to do something that is generally a good idea anyway. Join or start a local parent support group. Yes, it\'s great to be able to come here to make \"friends,\" but we can\'t step in to give each other \"boots on the ground\" help. If you reach out to other parents of ASD kids, you might be able to help each other in babysitting emergencies. Or simply start a babysitting coop of sorts. The key is to keep in mind that there are going to be circumstances during which you will not be able to help your child, so it\'s important to come up with some truly workable plan now.</P> <P>One other thought. Child Protective Services (or whatever they\'re called near you). They are not only in charge of looking into child abuse, but also child neglect. So they clearly have to have access to services that help parents find caretakers for their kids so that they don\'t simply leave kids alone in an emergency. Perhaps CPS in your area has a list of respite services. It might be worth a call.</P>'

'Just when I thougt I have move beyond the point of feeling sorry for myself here it is bearing it\'s ugly head again!!!!!! Last night was horrible. My daughter (2 1/2 yrs old) does what she\'s been doing alot lately. She won\'t go to sleep without me laying at the foot of her bed. NO biggie. I can usually escape within 30 mintues - 1 hour. Which I did last night. Then around 12:30 she woke up. And she always cries for me, so after a bit I go in there. And again she won\'t stop crying till I lay down. Well everytime I would start to get off the bed she would wake up and start crying for me to lay down again. I was stuck in there till 4:30 this morning. I just don\'t know what has happened to her sleep schedule!!! She was always such a good sleeper until about 4 months ago. Until then she always took a 2 hour nap and slept 12 hours each night. We used to tuck her in and say good night and off to sleep she would go. Her sleep habits now include waking up 1-3 times per night. I am so sleep deprived! Last night I just layed at the bottom of her bed and cried. She didn\'t really notice. I love my child, more than life itself, but last night I wanted to run out the front door so badly! I feel like such a horrible mom today for feeling that way. I think I\'m going to have to talk to someone. I\'m so against talking to a therapist, but I may be headed down that road. When I was really upset last night I kept thinking about leaving her &amp; my husband, that they would be better off without me. Then I thought then I would feel guilty the rest of my life for leaving her....then I started asking God to just kill me and put me out of my misery. How pathetic is that? I have been doing so good lately with dealing with her having Autism and she has been behaving pretty good lately but it seems like all it takes is one bad day or evening and all my old feelings come back. I know that God has a reason for my child having Autism but I can\'t stop asking why this had to happen to me! I\'m still devastated that I probably won\'t be having any more children either. I always saw myself with 2 kids, but I can barely handle the one I have I think I would loose it mentally if I had another special needs child. Thanks for listening to me pity myself today, it does help a bit to get it all out and these are things that I will never tell someone I know. I\'m too scared of what they will think of me and they will think I\'m a horrible mother. <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Linda L.

'You need to take him to a child/adolescent psychiatrist who specializes in autism spectrum disorders. Many of these issues can be treated with medication. However, a good and entirely postive behavior intervention plan probably ought to be put in place, first. Time out often exacerbates behaviors in ASD kids. And, at 11, your son is entering puberty, which sometimes brings with it serious behavioral issues because of the surges of testosterone. The alphabet soup dx\'s you mention are A PART of Asperger\'s, not usually a separate dx. For example, kids with Asperger\'s who experience OCD-like obsessions actually enjoy these obsessions and get calm from them. People who have classic OCD might have the same behaviors, but they HATE them and feel compelled to do these things as opposed to being soothed by these activities the way a child with AS often is.

I was livid, I called the principal and told her if she didn\'t do something and now that I would go to the next school board meeting and throw her name around, and that I would be sure there was media coverage before hand.

'<P>I took Alex (4.5 pdd-nos) for the whole enchilada testing at U of M and they didn\'t give me a firm diagnosis. I think they were afraid to categorize him because of his age. I just flat out asked the devel ped if it was pdd-nos and she agreed. The school system did their own testing and want to do more in the fall. The school psych said that an educational diag and medical diag could be different (????). Our school is implementing a new autism testing program in the fall, they will test him then. Our pediatrician didn\'t address any of my questions about him, these guys are the worst. He just said \"don\'t worry, boys are just slower to develop\". What is this 1950? </P> <P>I guess my point is to go for the big testing, the schools and the peds don\'t know as much as they should. That should put your mind to rest too. I think I got more from our school system because I walked in with U of M test results. I know people in the same situation who rely on the school alone and they aren\'t getting all that Alex is.

'<P>Ok, before I comment further I just had some questions. First off, has this child had a formal diagnosis, and if so how long ago was this?? Next thing would be how old is he?? If he\'s school age then he would need a formal evaluation, IEP, etc. The other issue is why do you feel the child needs to see a peds every year?? My children do see the doctor when they are sick, but their shots are up to date, and the only time a child needs to see a doctor is on the regular visits deemed by the school. Now if she was referred to see specialists that\'s another story. My concern here is why the therapist is discussing your SIL\'s son with you?? I understand your worries and also your intention to help this boy, but I\'m confused as to why the therapist would deal with you rather than the parent?? She may know her job , but as far as saying such absolutes as \"you can work with him till your blue in the face, but it\'s the home enviroment that needs help\" is not only false to say, but non-encouraging. There\'s so many things that just don\'t sound right here, and I\'m not saying you are off base in your thoughts. But, at the present state of this situation there is not a amicable way to deal with your nephew. If this was your child and your SIL was doing the same, I\'m sure you\'d feel a bit defensive, and hurt. She is obviously struggling here with coming to terms with her child\'s diagnosis (IF he has one). I agree with the thoughts of being supportive on the sidelines, making her realize that you are on her team, but on her terms. Forcing a person to do something your way is not only insulting to their own intelligence, but is somewhat controlling in nature. I know you say that you have more elements to this picture that we aren\'t aware of, but from reading what you\'ve posted so far I can safely say this is not a good scenario, not only for you, but for the future relationship of your brother and SIL. If you push too hard they may just cut you off totally from any interaction at all. I read in one of the posts that any family member offering help for this child should be welcomed with open arms. In my view I can not agree. Not every person is cut out to deal with an ASD child , and even though they feel they can do the job just fine they would need initial training with supervision. </P> <P>I truly hope for everyone\'s sake that all of you can eventually get on the same page and work together to help your nephew.</P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by bellaaaaaaaa on August 21 2006 at 8:30pm</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom to Dan 10, asperger\'s, and Mikey 7, moderate ASD</div>'

'Wow. I am going to be really honest here. We have three <br />boys. Our middle child has autism. I always wanted more <br />than two children, and I always wanted them to be close <br />in age so that they could go through the angst-worthy <br />stages of life together and be each other\'s support <br />system. <br />I knew that there was a problem with my middle son. It <br />quite possibly contributed to a near nervous breakdown <br />when he was young and showing the first signs. <br /> <br />My in-laws were extremely...unsupportive, to say the <br />least. There were heaps of criticism, of standing back <br />and looking down their nose and making hurtful comments <br />such as, \"If my child had problems I would not be <br />irresponsible enough to have another. I would never do <br />that to another child, that is completely unfair, etc...\" <br /> <br />VERY hurtful stuff. Comments made about \"closing the baby <br />factory\", etc. I have not and will NEVER get past those <br />comments. <br /> <br />Guess what? We wanted another child so desperately and <br />defied the naysayers and I became pregnant with less than <br />enthusiastic family support (cannot possibly express how <br />demeaning and demoralizing that part was). <br /> <br />He was born, absolutely perfect, and though he had a <br />speech delay and some other slight problems that were <br />initially of concern, that little red-headed bit of magic <br />is the glue that keeps our family together. He just <br />turned 9, makes the honor roll EVERY grading period, is <br />the most gorgeous thing you have ever seen and wakes up <br />just full of love, energy, jokes, you name it. <br /> <br />This boy is going to set the world on fire. I know that I <br />am a parent and they all say that, but he is such a <br />social butterfly, has so many interests, is so darn WITTY <br />and goes through life with such zest and zeal that I am <br />amazed and thankful every day. <br /> <br />Yep, autism is a crapshoot, so say the studies. But then, <br />so is life in general. Had we listened to the opinions of <br />other people, we would never have the treasure that we do <br />now. <br /> <br />This is truly a matter of the heart. NO-ONE can make this <br />decision but yourself and your husband. I cannot stress <br />this enough. I don\'t know where I would be in life <br />without my youngest in our family.

One night he ended up on the floor in our room, we had no idea he was even there.<br> <br> What\'s the deal with this?? I suppose it\'s good that he\'s at least staying in his room, but the floor can\'t be very comfortable. Last night we just left him there and he stayed in his room all night long; he usually makes an appearance in our room around 4:00.<br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mama to Jacob (5, autism) and Benjamin (18 months, so far so good)</div>'

'My daughter recently had a strange viral infection. One doct said it was hand foot and mouth, her regular pediatrician disagreed. She had a big language regression at this time. This was heartbreaking...her speech therapist was worried. We are all concerned about seizures. She tends to zone off many times a day for about 10 seconds or so....and she won\'t really come back to you until she is ready too. No sporadic movements, but something caused this regression and the zoning off thing happens many times. Even waving your hand in front of her face doesn\'t do it. Call it moms intuition, I could be wrong. <br>We are setting her up with an EEG. I have no idea what to expect. I heard it is hard to get into a neurologist soon. My question is to those of you who have had an EEG, what your experience is. Is it common for kids on the spectrum to have seizures? Did the seizures seem to be the big cause for language deficit? Did meds help greatly with language or just stopping regression? Thanks for any shared info on this. <br> <div class=\'post_sig\'>- 4UDonnette  girl, 4, PDDNOS or DD</div>'

'Here\'s the thing: we\'ve done time out in the playroom, but as I said, it becomes a script. Even if she hates time out, she still does it to fulfill the script. It\'s like there\'s no action/consequence with her, ie. if I do this, this will happen. Even if it\'s a completely negative consequence with her, she\'ll do it again and again, only because that\'s what she expects. I\'ve been neutral. I could find the most negative consequence in the world, and she\'d still do it 100 times over. Eliminating the emotional reaction on my part helps, but it seems like she doesnt\' get cause/effect in regards to punishment. The only thing that has worked has been extinction, which I\'ve actually used quite a bit, but I just don\'t know how to deal with behaviours that have to be punished. In fact, sometimes she enjoys punishment, even if I am completely neutral and just tell her straight what the deal is,her attitude is: oh, what fun, I\'m going into time out. <span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by Epiphany on June 21 2006 at 6:53am</span><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mother of  Clarissa born 2001/12/25 -HFA  Francesca born 2005/04/04 - PDD-NOS  Emily Rose born 2008/06/30</div>'

'<P>My son Christian (6 yers old) has a serious anxiety problem with school. So much so that parents come up to me everyday and ask me how he\'s doing, if I know what the cause of his anxiety is. They ask - is he being teased, has he been to see a psychiatrist, it\'s separation anxiety. Some days the office staff and his teachers have to pry his hands from my clothes and I have to make a quick get away and I can hear him crying as they take him away. I am not so much embarrassed but feel great empathy for him and whatever it is that\'s causing him such distress. I had my first meeting with the school pyschologist last week and he went over some of the scores for the evaluation. Was heartbreaking for me to hear. He (pyschologist) hasn\'t finished his report but said that Chris will fall somewhere on the spectrum. His IQ was 73 percentle <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley6.gif\" border=\"0\">. I feel in limbo right now. Just more waiting. I did asked the pyschologist if he was aware of my son\'s anxieties in the mornings and he said that he has observed him 10 times in different settings but had not seen him crying in the mornings though he has heard about it. I am psyching myself up for the next meeting which I think will be an IEP.</P> <P>Chris\' other scores for language, verbal skills, motor skills were also very poor.

'<br />How wonderful that you and Katelyn had a better day today! <br /> <br />Yes, visual schedules (with pictures) are more effective for ASD kids than verbal prompts or even the written words. It is a common strategy to help kids know what they like is coming and to transition from one activity to the next. It can also be used like a reward system (list everything that needs to be done with the reward at the end - like Boobahs.) <br /> <br />My daughter used one at school for a few years. The pictures were attached with velcro, so could be moved around easily. <br /> <br />Good luck with the diet and the schedules! Sounds like you have a great therapist working with her. <br /> <br />I also have to tell you that sometimes you will have really bad days. But then a really great day happens and you will remember the great days more than the bad.

'<P>Allegra,</P> <P>I think it is difficult for people outside Australia to realise just how poor our services are. I sometimes look at the board and see that other parents have their children who are the same age or younger than Sharlet and Lachlan going to \'school\' or getting good el services.</P> <P>Just to clarify for others - in Australia we are not entitled to anything! An educational lawyer/advocate is unheard of here. If our state or federal government does supply a service it is extremely limited and will most definately be limited in funding which means you have next to no chance of getting services.</P> <P>We have to go private for almost everything. I pay $60 per speech session, $100 for each psychologist visit, $80 for each pediatrictions visit.</P> <P>Lachlan has qualified for a local service (which relies totally on a small governement handout and donations) which will start in February. This will get him 1 hour of service per week. Yep you read right!! 1 hour.</P> <P>If I want private services ABA therapy is $30,000-$50,000 per year. That is for 20 hours per week. No rebates or government help.</P> <P>This is not a boo hoo story for us in Australia - just a reality. I think other countries are far more ahead of the game than we are here.</P> <P>Allegra, I think you do an amazing job with Sharlet. You are so far ahead of the game and you just dont know it. Sharlet using PECS is a fantastic start. Enrolling her in childcare to boost her interaction with other children is also priceless.</P> <P>My psychologist who used to be involved in the El program Lachlan is going to be doing has said that it is common in Australia for people not to even seek services until their children are 4 and that is usually only because the kinder teacher recomends them. That alone speaks volumes about how far behind as a country we are.</P> <P>Your hubbys experience and your dedication to Sharlet as her parents are making the difference to her now. <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley32.gif\" border=\"0\"> She is as good as she is <EM><U>because</U></EM> of you not in spite of you.</P> <P>Just a couple of suggestions for you.

I use mine for Lochie to get him the speech and psychologist visits. I also plan getting Lochie private swimming lessons this year. He won\'t cope in a class, so this does help for things like that.

I meant to introduce myself and Patrick! I guess they stuck him in the PDD-NOS category is because his verbal skills are great and he has lots of friends and is very social. He just keeps doing repetitive things. I hadn\'t really paid a whole lot of attention, because I am so used to it, but last week at their soccer game, I saw Pat on the sidelines. And for the first time I saw him like an outsider would - he was rocking back and forth and flapping his hands and chewing on his shirt. That\'s when it really hit me. I felt so sorry for him at that moment, so much compassion. My little Patpat was not quite like the others. It doesn\'t help that his coach won\'t play him or his twin brother Tommy very much. I think they played about two minutes each, which makes me mad since with YMCA soccer, all kids are supposed to play 50% of the game. I <strong>know</strong> my kids are the youngest, smallest, and have the gross motor skills of a 4 year old, but I still want them to participate on a team. This might be their only chance to be a member of a team, you know? They cheer like crazy for their team and are so proud.</FONT></P> <P><FONT size=2>Other things you may be interested to know: I had trouble in my pregnancy (pre-eclampsia), they were born at 30 weeks, they had TTTS, Pat got late-onset Group B strep, which led to septic shock, DIC, and meningitis. I\'ve been worried about autism since he was about two, because he never kissed me (and still never has) or said I love you. He sort of hugs me now, which is the first affection I\'ve seen in him.

'Frankly, I don\'t think you\'re doing ANYTHING wrong. I think sometimes our kids just have mental meltdowns from trying so hard all the time. We\'re always \"working on\" or \"working with\" them and I think some days they just freak out over it. We can\'t predict when those days will come, so we just have to try to understand that they\'re not always going to respond to PECS or whatever other therapy we do with them. You are trying so hard.

He has a huge issue with being away from me, and panics, if he can\'t find me. It makes it hard to get anything done, because he totally panics, calling for me, and crying.

'<P>I have posted this several times and lots of people don\'t want to hear it. However, it does address the \"didn\'t catch it in time\" guilt. While I FULLY support intervention early and as intensely as necessary and do think it helps kids, it rarely CHANGES kids. My son will be 17 tomorrow. He got preschool interventions back in the 1990\'s. He was in a class that included 6 NT kids and 6 kids on the spectrum. I have met his ASD classmates out in the world in recent years and was struck by something. Although all of them have come a LONG way (including my son), they are all the same relative to one another as they were in preschool. What I mean is that the one who was the most verbal then is the most verbal now, the one that was the most social then is the most social now, the one who was the most academically oriented then is the one who is likely to go to college, etc. None of these kids changed into being a person they were not when they were 2. I don\'t think this means that therapy is worthless. ALL these kids got plenty of that. If they hadn\'t, they would definitely not have had the SKILLS they have. However, having decent skills doesn\'t change someone as a person. If I learned Chinese, it would not make my essence any different. That holds true for our kids, too. They are who they are. What we CAN do for them is get them the best skills they can learn and show them how to use those skills to compensate for any deficits that remain. </P> <P>Not a single one of us asked for autism. Not a single one of us can make it disappear. We bear NO BLAME. NONE. If you continue to suffer from guilt, this will only hurt your boy. Support here might help. If not, please seek more professional help to deal with it. Nothing about autism is easy, including coming to grips with it, emotionally. </P><span class=\"smText\"><br /><br />Edited by tzoya on February 04 2008 at 5:34am</span>'
'My son sounds very similar to sswbrn\'s son. At 17 months he knew the alphabet, numbers, colors, and shapes. When he was 2.5 he started spelling words to us. By 3.5 he\'s reading. We\'re not sure how much he can read because he doesn\'t talk a lot but sometimes he\'ll sit down on my lap with a book and read every page to me. I can spell out really long words, words that my 12 year old has trouble with!, and he tells me what it says immediately. He\'s also doing basic math. It will be interesting to see how the schools handle him when he gets older - so advanced in reading (and possibly math) but so behind in language, social skills, self-help skills, etc.'

All of his little stimming things come and go.......sometimes they are bad, sometimes not..........it\'s just him, dealing with his world and ours.</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Parents of a 6Yr old very sweet non verbal autistic son, who also has some issues with food allergies as well.</div>'
'<P>My son does the same thing, and has been doing it for years, as long as I can remember. He does it to help calm himself, he has an anxiety disorder and a severe stutter, which is also caused by the anxiety. He just turned 7 and is in second grade. He didn\'t start talking until after he turned 3. He goes to speech therapy 5 days a week. They work on fluency, some letter sounds he has trouble with, like l and th, and pragmatics. </P> <P>I don\'t try to make him stop, only because with him it is all about his anxiety. I also fight for him on this issue at school, teachers complain about the noise, but so far they have been outnumbered at the IEP meetings and instructed to ignore the noise and offer him a break. He has made some improvements though, it is not nearly as frequent or loud as it used to be! Maybe your OT or ABA has some suggestions on how to handle it? Good luck!</P>'
'<P>Tzoya brings up a really good question- I know they told you the bus driver is not allowed to honk or call ahead. Who\'s policy is this and why? It is worth asking because we have a special ed driver who does the following: 1. honk 2. drive around the block one time, pull up and honk again 3. walk up to the house (there is an aide on the bus) and knock on the door. So, if our driver is doing it and it is a part of our district policy, there aren\'t any federal regulations preventing it from happening.</P> <P>Sometimes school districts have dumb policies and when you ask, they were created by someone who held the job 10 years ago, and everyone keeps following the policy without knowing why. Asking why is a good thing- just an insider perspective.</P>'
'<P>Notime...I guess I would fall into the \"maniac\" category. I create situations where my son needs to use words. When he was 2-3, I too put toys, food, etc, out of reach to force him to communicate with me somehow (besides screaming). I still instinctively do the opposite of what he wants just to elicit a response. This also gives me opportunity to teach and reward appropriate responses. </P> <P>His language exploded soon after I started B12 shots and increased his ABA hours (his ABA therapists also do the antagonist thing). One night, after I gave him the shot in the rear end (no anesthesia or numbing cream), he looked straight into my eyes and said, \"Mommy, why did you hurt me? Do I need a shot to get better?\" My feelings would have been hurt had I not been so elated that he produced such coherent and wonderful sentences. </P> <P>I\'m not an advocate of the torture/rubber band snapping stuff, but I do believe in tough love. I think parents can see the potential in their kids moreso than anyone and are the best people to bring out the best in their kids, even if it means we look like maniacs from time to time.</P> <P> </P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom of 4 yr old twins - one with PDDNOS</div>'

'My daughter also has always eaten A LOT. She is adopted from Korea and when we picked her up there, she was huge! Over time she has slimmed down quite a bit because she is so active and we only let her eat healthy foods. My understanding though, is that this is a part of ASD sometimes. Some kids cannot monitor their intake. She is 3 now and I\'m not sure if this gets better with time.'

'HAH, ya I did this ALL the time when I was a kid. I only did it tho at my old neghboorhood and around the time I moved at about 8.75 I didnt do it anymore, different setting, new people and I guess I began to understand ya cant be doin stuff like this. <br /> <br />I used to go around dressed up as a ghost buster, in my uniform and proton pack and all and would go around to the neghboors and charge them $1 to rid their house of ghosts, the parents went along with it and gave me money even tho mom was angry at me for doing it afterwards when I told her what I did, but the kids didnt like it so much suddenly I would be in their house up in their rooms and stuff. HAH. <br /> <br />I also used to go around asking for keys to things like their sheds, garadge, ya... the key thing was a whole... thing really when I was little. Always needed keys to everything. I would casually go around, ring door bells, ask for their kids to come play (and by this time I was about 8, and now as an adult I get the feeling the neghboors didnt think I was funny anymore, and because of my often aggressive/violent behavor with their kids they never let them come out anymore). SOmetimes I would even turn on their water spiggits, or ya, even dig up their yard if I could find a shouvel, heh. <br /> <br />Ya, with a bit of social awairness they will someday understand this is not how you go about stuff. I was never really taught so much, I kept doing it even after being yelled at just in a different way, I guess I was a pest, heh. <br /> <br />My parents never really fixed the problem, but when I moved I stopped for some reason, just different place, new people, and I was getting older I guess.

'<P>After reading all 9 pages, I have to say thank you Sunflowers. I totally do understand your POV. I have been told by all professionals that my 4 yr old will always be mainstreamed because he is very high functioning. So whether I like it or not, he is always going to be in an NT enviroment with NT people and I will have to prepare him for world and the only effective way I have seen so far is to throw him out there and let him experience everything and not give excuses that he is allowed certain inappropriate behaviour just because he is autistic.</P> <P>I can say for a fact that since Michael learnt how to use basic words like \" Please\", \"Thank you\" \" you are welcome\" \" May I please...\" and learnt behaviours that deal with taking turns, waiting and sharing, he has had made more friends, parents of NT children are more forthcoming in letting him play with their children and his peers do not see him as the\"bad\" \"rude\" boy they should stay away from.</P> <P>Yes...its ignorance on their part but 4-5 year old NT children do not know that and we can\'t teach them to play and communicate with our child. We can only teach our child to play and communicate with them and for him to be able to make friends, he needs to learn social behaviours that are similar to his peers.</P> <P>I can\'t speak for all parents and their kids or Aspies or people in the spectrum but for my unique very high functioning autistic son, teaching him acceptable NT social skills and behaviour, although was hard on him at first and took months, they have helped him tremendously.</P>'

'<P>IF YOU CAN TELL WHICH KIDS ARE \"REGULAR\" AND WHICH KIDS ARE \"INCLUDED,\" IT\'S NOT INCLUSION.</P> <P>I LOVE that definition.</P> <P>Let me inject here a bit of disability education history. Back at the beginning of IDEA (late 70\'s), in response to the exhortation to provide the \"least restrictive environment,\" schools started doing what was then known as \"mainstreaming.\" Up until 1975, kids with disabilities HAD NO LEGAL RIGHT TO GO TO SCHOOL AT ALL. So going to school, period, was a new thing, and being \"allowed\" to attend \"regular\" classes, which is what mainstreaming was, was considered VERY forward thinking. What it meant was that students with disabiltiies had to \"earn their way\" into general education classes. If a student with a disability was thought to have what it took to \"make it\" in a \"regular\" class, that student was mainstreamed into that class and only that class (or only classes that the IEP Team felt confident the student could \"make it\" in.) </P> <P>Another ten years elapsed and there was more and more evidence that separate is no more equal with special needs kids than it is for kids of minority races. So the concept of \"inclusion\" was created. What it meant was that students with disabilities should literally be included with their non-disabled peers in the same proportion as they represent in society. About 12%. That would mean 2 or 3 disabiled kids in a typical grade school class. The idea would be to just send them to the class that they would have gone to had they not had a disability and THEN support them IN THAT CLASS with appropriate teachers, staff and therapies. At first, this idea was resisted by the bureaucracies that are the schools. However, after a few years, schools began to see how they could take this idea of \"inclusion\" and use it to their own bureacratic ends. What they did was create \"inclusion classes,\" the antithesis of the original inclusion idea. For the most part, inclusion classes are classes of about 25 with 2/3rds being general education students and one third being special education students. There is usually a general ed teacher and a special ed teacher assigned to the group. The special ed teacher is sometimes there for only half a day. There are many, many variations on this theme, but they are all \"exclusion classes\" at their core. What they do is serve to exclude problematic kids from the regular classes by creating a \"special regular class,\" if you will. From what I\'ve seen of these inclusion classes (and certainly there must be some exceptions) is that about 8 to 10 of the students (tho sometimes 50%) are classified students with significant needs. The others tend to be either kids who have not yet been classified but who are \"at risk,\" or they are high functioning students who ARE classified. In any event, the vast majority of the students in these classes are far from \"regular.\" I\'ve taken to calling inclusion classes \"special ed lite.\" They are great for parents who refuse to have their kids classifed into special ed because their students get put into these classes as \"general ed students\" (saving the parents\' egos) and then get special ed without actually being classified. But it fools parents of classified kids into thinking that their kids are with NT kids. They generally are not. If you want to KNOW what the class composition is, ask for a class profile. That means that you can get a count of ALL the kids in the inclusion class who are classified (even if they are being counted as gen. ed. kids), their IQ scores, their classifications, their reading and math scores, etc. YOu can also ask for the reading and math levels on the gen. ed. kids to see if they are \"at risk.\" </P> <P>My point is that both \"mainstreaming\" and \"inclusion\" are terms that schools use to mean something, but neither term means being automatically included with the general population of kids in the proportion in which your child\'s disabiltiy occurs in the general population. That really doesn\'t happen in most schools. </P> <P>Of course, many parents of ASD kids have found that the special environmental needs of their kids, not to mention their special educational needs, simply don\'t get MET in a mainstreaming or inclusions situation. Where this is usually most apparent is when Asperger\'s kids are put in typical Middle Schools. Because of their average or above average academic ability, they are often just thrown in the mainstream in a world where puberty is making EVERYONE nuts. Tony Attwood, the most famous Asperger\'s expert, says this is one stage of life in which Asperger\'s kids need to be separated from the mainstream, even if this means homeschooling them.

'My son can talk and wants to make friends, he hit all <br />milestones as an infant as well.

'<P>I would also request formal Parent Training to teach you how to use PECS at home. Unless your child uses it 24/7/365, it won\'t work. You, your dh, your other children, the babysitter, etc. ALL need to use PECS. And you need to keep everything that your child wants and needs OUT OF HIS REACH so that he will be REQUIRED to \"ask\" you for it using an icon. The beauty of PECS is that is uses the child\'s visual strength to SHOW him what language is used for. The \"E\" is for \"EXCHANGE.\" The child SEES communication being exchanged - something that doesn\'t happen with the spoken word.</P> <P>Good luck and keep us posted. PECS can work wonders, but it can take awhile, so persistence and consistence is key.</P>'
'<P>The DSM IV TR is the American Psychological Association\'s diagnostic \"bible\". It is what all psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, etc. diagnose a mental disorder.

I posted the criteria on another thread - you could search by my username and I posted it yesterday, I believe. </P> <P>Anyway, that is the criteria that people are going to be looking at to diagnose your son. Social impairment is a key hallmark in diagnosing autism. So that is why I suggest you look at the criteria because if your son is APPROPRIATELY social (back and forth conversations with peers, taking turns, sharing, doing lots of pretend play - not just re-enacting something he has seen on tv) then you might have a difficult time getting a diagnosis of autism. </P> <P>Hope this helps!</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS (9 yo) diagnosed with mild PDD-NOS and DD (6 yo) NT - but definitely a challenge!</div>'

'Responding to the original question, I have taken my son to two DAN doctors. the first was simply an allergist who has been to a conference. He did food allergy testing and blood testing on my son which did show a dairy sensitivity and somewhat elevated levels of antibodies to gluten. I also took him to Dr. Usman in IL and she ordered a few tests which I haven\'t done yet but will soon. We reviewed the supplements I had him on and she adjusted a few things and reccommended a few more. It wasn\'t terrible expensive - about $850 total for her visit which lasted at least 2 hours. The supplements aren;\'t too pricey since I buy most online through Kirkman labs. I think he has improved greatly though he also started therapy at the same time as the GFCF diet and supplements. I would not take him off anything to see what makes the difference since I don\'t want to waste even one day.

'I love all of these creative suggestions. Hope one works for you. My guess is that it terrifies him that something could simply disappear from his life. Poof!!! If something as big as his glider can disappear, why not him? Or you? Perhaps the above suggestions will help. I hope so. Here\'s another, riskier suggestion. Do you think he could get the concept of the glider having moved but not disappeared? Would going to visit it at your friends\' house help or hurt? I don\'t know how old Jasper is, but just because he is very verbal doesn\'t mean his cognitive maturity and ability to make sense of an otherwise random world (at least as he sees it) is any better, given his ASD, than another young, non-verbal ASD child. I hope one of these suggestions works soon for him. My 16yo is still mourning the loss of a broken starfish toy that got thrown out 4 years ago. A toy he NEVER played with. Whenever he gets tired or anxious, he starts begging me to call the postoffice to see if someone sent it back to the postman (I think he got this idea because of mail order). If I could, I\'d replace it, but it was recalled because they ALL broke and don\'t exist anymore. SIGH.'

'I love the quote from the evaluation. That\'s really helpful in terms of knowing what to do about it - NOT! Today I just turned to my son and said: Sweetie, you\'ve got to teach Mamma how to help you. You\'ve got to tell me what bothers you at school: what you like and what you don\'t like and then I can help you. I just felt so desperate like a bunch of us adults were spinning our wheels trying to figure him out and I thought-gee, maybe my best bet is to ask him! He sort of tells me, but then he contradicts himself and if I prompt too much-he just says what he thinks I mean by the prompt and not the true answer of what he feels. Even so, I keep trying to get him to express his feelings more. Actually, some things he has really helped me understand. I realize now that he HATES the sound of someone going up the stairs behind him-it scares him for whatever reason. He now tells me when I\'m browning hamburger that it is \"too stinky\"-and it\'s clear that it makes him fidgety. So slowly, I\'m getting clues. I can\'t help but feel that if he has a disability that were more concrete, I could accept it more. If he were blind, I would know what that is. I could understand what he was lacking. I could put on a blindfold and try to live in his shoes. But autism? I don\'t know what it feels like to be him.<br>Nowwhat<br>'

'<P>I just read Linda\'s post and I wanted to add that she is right. For some reason I misread your post and thought you had seen a child psychiatrist (who is a licensed MD) but a child psychologist really can\'t diagnose at all. To diagnose autism, you need a diagnosis from someone who is a licensed MD. A dev ped has 2 additional years of training in developmental issues, in addition to the training to be a pediatrician. However, there are good and bad dev peds. In the clinic we went to, there was one great one and one terrible one. The terrible one had tons of publications and tons of experience - but had awful bedside manner and didn\'t believe in Asperger\'s Syndrome at all. He would tell parents their child just needed more discipline and they should take parenting classes. Can you BELIEVE that? </P> <P>So, do your research and even if you have to drive a long distance, it will be worth it. A dev ped isn\'t someone you see more than twice a year (if that) and to get that diagnosis if you need it?

'I recently decided that I wanted to try a weighted blanket for my daughter. I went online looking for them and realized they\'re quite pricey. After a few hours of coffee and google, I found a few DIY patterns and ideas to make your own. I made one, and Gabby loves it! I want to start making them and offering them at a lower cost to parents (like we don\'t spend enough money already) I know my skills aren\'t really all that fantastic, some wavy stitching and double seams.

SO, If anyone around here wants a blanket or a lap pad or anything weighted, I\'d like to try out my skills and practice. I hope I\'m not soliciting here, I\'m just out of kids to practice on LOL.

'O.K. Now that we\'ve all had our run-ins with the troll herd, this board needs to get back to basics. The purpose is to post about Autism and PDD related issues, not to argue with trolls, vent about trolls. its flooding the board and we\'re all losing sight of the big picture here. OUR KIDS. I think after today, nothing else should be posted in response to any troll related threads. I too need to stop, we are all angry and upset but we\'re losing sight on what we need to be doing here. If they continue then no response to their threads and no response to their responses. If everyone does this, then they will stop, if they don\'t no one is going to be paying attention to them anyway. Since our so called moderators are no where to be found, all of us will have to turn a blind eye to the \"uneducated\". It may be hard and it may be that some of us may want to take a break. but for this issue I think the best response is NO RESPONSE.

'<P>Vija,</P> <P>We didn\'t do PGD, since the the genetic testing results didn\'t show any abnormality. I did beg for an amino with my second son, but my doctor wouldn\'t give me one. At the time of my second pregnancy, my older son had not yet been diagnosed with Autism (although he had been diagnosed with a multitude of other things). I was so scared to have a second child because I was terrifed that he or she would be more severely impaired, but I also desparately wanted another child. If we had known that my older son was autistic and known of the increased possibility that a second child would be similarly affected, I\'m not sure that we would have gotten pregnant again. I would definately consider PGD if I had the opportunity and there was a chromosomal abnormality. The trouble with Autism is that unless it is a result of a condition such as Fragile X, etc. the doctors don\'t know how to indentify it genetically, so the PGD would be inconclusive for Autism. I do however, truly believe that Autism is genetic and that one day the gene or genes responsible for it will be identified.</P> <P>Good luck to you in your decision.</P> <P>Tiffany</P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mom of 14 yr old son (PDD-NOS, ADHD, Auditory Processing Difficulties) and 10 yr old son (ADHD)</div>'

'<P><FONT size=2>It\'s true about the diploma and college, but, early on, it can be clear that many of our kids are not going to be college bound. My son will never make college-he has been delayed in school and needs life skills and social skills a heck of a lot more than algebra-he\'d never grasp the concept. If you have an ASDer (usually these are Aspies) who you feel is college bound, he probably can get special services, but be mainstreamed for his classes so he can get a diploma.

'Wow, it\'s amazing to see how much therapy all your kiddos get! <br /> <br />Don\'s never had any formal therapy really, and I\'m certain if he had we\'d <br />be <br />further along than we are, but hey, progress is progress <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley2.gif\" border=\"0\"> <br /> <br />Donny attended a developmental preschool (not a good one though) from <br />age 3 1/2 until he started kindy. They introduced PECS, but there was no <br />follow through at home. They were more used for labelling and as a <br />visual schedule - not used as a communication method. Donny received <br />up to 3 hours per week of ABA/VB, and a couple hours per month of OT <br />from the time he came up on the waitlist after diagnosis (so about half <br />way through kindergarten), until the end of his kindy year. Most of his <br />sessions were cancelled by his foster mom, and he aged out of the early <br />intervention program by the end of kindergarten. From the notes we got <br />when we adopted him, I saw that he had all of about 4 sessions with the <br />ABA/VB therapist, one SLP consult, and about 5 total sessions of OT, <br />including consult. <br /> <br />School provided him with a full-time one-to-one para, in a regular <br />classroom. There are no special education classrooms in our Province. <br />There are resource rooms for pullout, but they\'re not self-contained <br />classes, and there\'s no full-time special ed teacher. In our school system, <br />basically the paras are the teachers - it\'s atrocious really. <br /> <br />When Don moved in with us (early in Grade 1), he started receiving one <br />hour of PT/OT per month. School stayed the same. We implemented ABA <br />strategies and principles at home, along with visual schedules, BIP, and <br />PECS for labelling and requests. <br /> <br />Today, at 10 1/2 and in 5th grade, Donny attends school for a total of 5 <br />1/2 hours per week, in a self-contained classroom where he is the only <br />student (there is no teacher on site that works with Donny) and has two <br />paras assigned to him while he\'s there. He is not getting any speech, OT, <br />or PT - no formal therapies at all. We still use ABA principles at home. <br />We also have used a behavioural consultant in the past to shadow the <br />aides and provide some training, and also did some psychoed testing. <br /> <br />I\'m leaning towards getting Don some VB, but don\'t know who to hire, or <br />where to get the funds... <br /> <br />As for supplements, etc. we give Don a daily multivitamin and a very high <br />dose of CLO (1500mg/day). We did a fair amount of biomed stuff a <br />couple years ago to heal his gut and address some deficiencies <br />(probiotics, GSE, Taurine, Methionine, Zinc, Selenium, enzymes, GABA, <br />CalMag, etc.), and saw his physical health improve dramatically. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Donny 13 - classic autism, bipolar</div>'
'Just a question: how old is your son? <br /> <br />Where did he have access to porn? If he can\'t stay away from porn, he shouldn\'t be unsupervised near a computer, especially one without a filter. The kid has to be programmed for success. If he doesn\'t have access to porn, he won\'t disobey you. So to me the solution is to make sure he is never anywhere where he could have any kind of access to porn. He should be carefully supervised. His day and whereabouts should be structured in function of that goal. <br /> <br />Are you a person of faith? Have you sought out spiritual advice? Habits aren\'t changed. They\'re replaced. He needs some kind of fulfillment to replace the kick he\'s getting out of porn. <br /> <br /><div class=\'post_sig\'>- Mother of  Clarissa born 2001/12/25 -HFA  Francesca born 2005/04/04 - PDD-NOS  Emily Rose born 2008/06/30</div>'

'<P>Because a PDD-NOS diagnosis gives the impression that they don\'t have \"full\" autism. They only have a few of the symptoms or some are to a lesser degree. I would maybe get a second opinion on the PDD-NOS diagnosis for your son. I have not before heard of fraternal twins (boy and girl) where the girl is the more severely affected. I wonder if they aren\'t seeing some of the symptoms in your ds because they are putting it off to \"he\'s just a boy and boys develop slower\" ? I mean, I\'m no expert here - but I just wondered. </P> <P>We have been lucky enough that my ds\' PDD-NOS diagnosis so far has not disqualified him from any program we have sought. We wouldn\'t have gotten ABA even if he had Asperger\'s because our insurance didn\'t cover it and our school district doesn\'t provide it. Well, maybe they do to kids with \"severe\" autism, I\'m not sure. I haven\'t heard of any child with mild to moderate autism getting ABA paid for in our old school district. I don\'t know what the new school district does in terms of ABA - I doubt if they would give it to him and I\'m not sure he would need it at this point. The ASD teacher is going to start doing some RDI stuff with ds in the next few weeks and I think that will be very beneficial to him!</P> <P>But, I have heard of lots of cases where kids get a PDD-NOS diagnosis and thus are excluded from lots of services that they might need. We haven\'t applied for TEFRA because I\'m not sure it\'s worth it to us. If our new insurance starts trying to deny claims due to ds\' diagnosis, then we may have to pursue it - but that is something I\'m not sure we\'d qualify with because of his diagnosis. TEFRA is basically getting Medicaid but you have a co-pay based on parental income. You don\'t qualify for TEFRA based on income - it is based on the child\'s disability - but then you pay in a certain amount based on your income - if that makes sense! <IMG src=\"smileys/smiley5.gif\" border=\"0\"></P><div class=\'post_sig\'>- DS (9 yo) diagnosed with mild PDD-NOS and DD (6 yo) NT - but definitely a challenge!</div>'

'I would not go to a child psychologist. I had the same type of experience with the one we went to, but the exact opposite. Told me DS#1 had autism because \"he didn\'t acknowledge him\", but he did. The doc put his hand out, Nikolas went to shake it, about that time a puppy the doc had ran across the room and Nikolas very politely pushed his hand aside and took off after the puppy. The doc immediately, see that see that??!?!?!?! He didn\'t acknowledge me, decided he had autism in 3 seconds. I should have walked out. Take him to a dev pedi or a neurophys, psychs can\'t really diagnose anyway, at least no one I have found will accept their diagnosis cause they aren\'t a doctor. The school and the insurance said nope, need a diagnosis from an actual liscensed MD, and psychs aren\'t. I dumped the psych, I knew he was eventually going to tell me they were MR cause from others I had talked to he likes to give these small kids IQ tests and of course they score low. The child psych is not required no, and usually from what I have heard some general practioners send you to a psych first, and if the psych thinks its necessary then they sent you to the dev pedi. That is what my pedi did when we got here, sent me to the psych first cause there was no waiting. Dev pedis are usually hard to get in to, often a 6 month at least wait. You really need the diagnosis from the dev pedi or neuro because dev pedis and neuros are licensed doctors, and psychs aren\'t. Wait for that appt and pretty much forget the psych one.

'<P>There is a growing awareness of autism these days and a lot of teachers are trying super-hard not to miss a child who has autism. It is harder for kids the older they get - early intervention is key.</P> <P>It is hard to know from your post - but I would agree that it is good that the teacher is on top of this so soon. However, I think I would have been a little more cautious if I were her in how I approached you. Clearly, you were caught completely unaware. I might have said that we are seeing some issues in the classroom and are thinking of waiting 2 weeks and doing a full developmental evaluation to see if there are things we can better help him with. And, I might say that one of the things we would be looking at was high-functioning autism - amongst other things. </P> <P>If he is APPROPRIATELY social (not just wanting to be social - but following the rules of social etiquette that are appropriate for his age), I would be surprised if he got a diagnosis.</P> <P>Just because he is smart does not rule out autism - if you look around the board, you will find many parents have very smart kids. Some have genius-level skills in some areas. People with Asperger\'s Syndrome (a form of autism) must have an average or better IQ in order to get that diagnosis.</P> <P>I\'m NOT saying your son has autism - there is no way I can know that. From what you describe - it sounds like he may be a slow-to-warm-up kid. My dd is like that as well. Adjusting to kindergarten could take a while - I don\'t know how long the teacher gave it (don\'t know when he started kindergarten - we started school after Labor Day) but this seems pretty soon. I personally feel kids should be given at least 4-6 weeks to settle in to see how they are adjusting. Is this all-day kindergarten? That makes a big difference as well - my son was utterly EXHAUSTED the first 3-4 weeks of school - and he was old for his class and had attended half days (and one full day) every day for preschool the year before.</P> <P>Kids with summer birthdays often have a more difficult time adjusting because they are younger than most of the kids in the class. This is particularly the case with boys - which is why we held our son out. He was way emotionally behind the kids in his class anyway - and life has been much easier for him (so far) because he is one of the oldest kids in the class.</P> <P>A lot of kids with high-functioning autism do not get diagnosed until elementary school (some even older than that). As awareness increases, they are getting diagnosed earlier. We had an incredible pre-school teacher who brought our attention to the matter. Unlike you, we had suspected something and when the teacher brought it up - I just knew she was right. Usually parents have that gut instinct and it is not a complete shock - which is why I do wonder if they are mistaken on this. </P> <P>Please keep us posted - we are here for you and this is a great place to get advice and support.

'<P>\"He thinks something is wrong with him.\" OUt of the mouths of babes! </P> <P>We do our kids no service by obscuring the fact that they DO think differently I know plenty of Aspergers teens who were suicidal and when they landed in the mental hospital and FINALLY were told they had Asperger Syndrome, not insanity, they were SO relieved. They all said they KNEW they were different from a very early age and what a relief it is to know that \"it\'s not my fault.\" Get your son a DX as soon as you can. Have the doctor help explain to him how and why he thinks differently. Then get him the counseling and behavioral help he needs to attempt to learn to be a bit more typical in his thinking. He WILL be ostracized if he can\'t think and behave more typically. </P> <P>Yes, it\'s awful to think our kids think there\'s something wrong with them, but there is. \"Wrong\" may be the wrong word, but it expresses what they\'ve experienced and what is the truth - they don\'t think or act like typical kids and they will be shut out if they don\'t learn how to be more typical.</P>'

'I\'m sorry, I by no means intended to lay a guilt trip on you or make you <br />feel bad. I was simply reacting to your intial post where it appeared from <br />what was stated that he would only eat PB&J and on those days when it <br />wasn\'t served, he would simply avoid eating. It\'s just the way I <br />interpreted what was said. <br /> <br />I\'m probably a little sensitive to this issue, because it\'s been such a <br />struggle for us with my son, and we are just starting to see some light. <br />At age 2 my son was no where close to being able to reason with in this <br />area, and there were so many more important issues to address, that his <br />pickiness was the least of my worries at that point. <br /> <br />By all means make attempts to introduce him to other foods....and if you <br />can get him to try something new, great.

'ajmommy, <br /> <br />I completely understand where you\'re coming from as I\'ve been there. I was worried about my son, LONG before anyone else acknowledged an issue. In our situation, he was about a year old, when I started noticing that certain things weren\'t quite right. I mentioned my concerns to the pediatrician, who pretty much shrugged them off, and said not to worry. However, as I myself, am an obsessive person - I did. I read up on typical child development and kept notes on things that worried me. At his 18 month appointment, I again brought up concerns - I was told \'lets wait and see...\'. I simply explained that that was not my style and I had to do SOMETHING. It was then that a referral for EI was made. Long story short, he ended up starting various therapies through EI and was diagnosed with Apraxia and Sensory Integration Dysfunction. Over the years, other things have popped up here and there, and Jake was just very recently diagnosed with Autism and ADHD. <br /> <br />I\'ve been repeatedly told by family, friends, dh, etc - not to worry, that things were fine and it would all work itself out. I wasn\'t leaving that up to chance! <br /> <br />My guess is that if EI didn\'t see cause for services at this point, you\'re probably okay so far. There is a huge variation in typical development and maybe she\'s just on the latter end, or it could be her personality, etc. However, if you are still concerned - educate yourself. Read up on typical development, and activities you can do to stimulate it, etc. Keep notes of your concerns, and be sure to talk with the pediatrician about it. However, TRY not to obsess over \'what could be wrong\' so much that you forget to enjoy your daughter. If something isn\'t right, you\'re still going to love her, and value your memories of her - so certainly stay vigilant, but enjoy her too. <br /> <br />I\'m available anytime you need to talk. I\'ve certainly been there and i\'ve worried so much that I did wonder whether there was something wrong with me and that maybe I somehow \'wanted\' something to be \'wrong\' with Jake, or that I was \'creating\' problems. Honestly, I still wonder that at times .... though more and more professional involved with Jake are starting to \'back me up\'. While it does make me feel slightly less crazy, it sucks a bit, because then maybe there really is more going on with him. <br /> <br />Anyway, I understand and can sympathize (and bluebird - I DO see a therapist too <img border=\"0\" src=\"smileys/smiley2.gif\" border=\"0\"> ). <div class=\'post_sig\'>- Jen -Mom to Jacob (7)HFA and ADHD, and Mikey (6)</div>'
