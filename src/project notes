improvemtnt:
1. compute the most common forum can be improved in two ways:
	- we can maintain a field for each node of all the messages it has.
	- when computing on this set, which forum is most common - we can use counting sort because we know that the forum numbers are in range [1,2,3,4] and we have
	
	
2. Tree class line 37 delete old messages from inner nodes

3. when constructing the tree we can save only the best tree so far and the current tree being tested. so we can save memory and improve perfomance

improvement:
instead of searching for all the leaves and this requires traversig the tree. each in the best case it's n log n but its even worse because we need to regret back if this leaf is already calculated
so i save an arraylist of all the leaves when i create the tree and add leaves to it and then it's O(n) for "free" (why free -explain)

3. stop words
4. html words - early processing.

5. when splitting - make sure no two leafs that are bros have the same classification
